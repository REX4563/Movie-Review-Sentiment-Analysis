Would I call Doom a good movie? Not really. Do I still enjoy it? Yes!For me the interaction between the actors is working pretty well and the movie delivers something resembling the game Doom in terms of scenario. We have some of the monsters that can be found in the game even though they're not really demons but something else.In addition the action scenes are pretty entertaining and especially the first person shooter style scene is very well done.Does the movie still have problems? Definitely. The characters themselves are rather stupid in their behavior and overall pretty flat. The story writing as well is not great.Still watching Karl Urban and The Rock going at each other is pretty fun.

OK, we are all hearing how Doom the movie is a complete sellout etc, but still this is an enjoyable movie. The Rock as Sarge is absolutely perfect! i just couldn't imagine Karl Urban doing a better job then The Rock when it comes to Sarge. Although many have branded this film "Resident Evil in Space" and yeah it is but that doesn't subtract from the film at all. The 1st person scene was especially pulled off well and will give you some giggles (c'mon who didn't laugh?).The Score is absolutely awesome and sets the atmosphere perfectly! too me this film had an old school 80's horror feel to it which i felt made it that more enjoyable (we got lots of uncensored over the top gore which now we don't get enough of). Overall don't judge this movie till you see it because it is a lot better then people rate it unless your looking to find something thats a 100% identical too its source material (Doom 3) then i'd advise you to not watch this film because some of it has been completely rewritten from its original context hence no hell. Overall a lot better then what i was expecting too see

There are certain genres that are despised no matter what. The genre of movies based on video games is one of those and rightfully so. There have been a large amount pretty awful video game adaptations of such games as Wing Commander, Super Mario Bros., Tomb Raider, Street Fighter, Double Dragon, and House of the Dead. There have been, however, some decent adaptations like Mortal Kombat (the first film, not the sequel) and the Resident Evil films. Now that I've viewed the unrated version, DOOM can be added to that list. Although not nearly as stylish and entertaining as Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil, DOOM may not be the mind-blowing spectacle that fans of the video game were hoping for, but at least it knows what it is: a fun ALIENS knock-off. Unlike ALIENS, Doom lacks a strong story and well-developed characters that the audience can cheer for. The characters here are barely one dimensional. They are given essentially no motivation for what they do and as a result, the movie suffers. Still, it's better than one would expect thanks to some slick directing, a couple solid action sequences, and The Rock. 7/10

I just rewatched Doom (17 years later) and was happily surprised at how good the film was and how much I enjoyed it.Urban is particularly good.I enjoyed the music and sound fx, however the visual fx, particularly the for the beasties, could have been sharper.I loved the part of the film that goes in to FPS mode, super effective and really fun.The weakest part of the film, the character of Pinky. He comes across as a bit of a flog and adds zilch to the movie.For some reason this movie was considered a bit of a failure but as I stated I liked it and had plenty of fun watching it. Give it a go :)

This movie should have been the "Aliens" of the 21st century. The Phobos base should have appeared dank and deserted, save the occasional body. The atmosphere should have built to an unbearable, silent tension. Then, and only then, the hideous creatures from hell should have started climbing out of walls and from under floors, and devouring the marines.But instead, the set of the base was boring (the film looked like it was shot in a single corridor). The atmosphere wasn't scary enough. The monsters were, frankly, pathetic. A guy in a rubber alien suit covered in KY jelly to make him look slimy may have worked 30 years ago, but not now. Where were the horrific bio-mechanical perversions of nature that characterised doom? (i.e. Spider Demon). Where was the demonic imagery? The torsos hanging from spikes in the ceiling? The five pointed stars painted on the floor in blood?The plot had nothing to do with the original games. The whole "24th chromosome" thing was actually less believable than a portal to hell, and undermined the tension when you found out that the creatures were actually human (once).There was no point to the film. No objective. Just people walking round corridors with guns. That may make a good game, but a film needs more than that. Even in Doom 3 (the game) there is a series of objectives, i.e. crossing the base to get to the transmitter and call for help. That's what this game needed - an objective for the marines to accomplish other than killing things. Without this, the film rambles on and the dialogue is superfluous, with no influence on the storyline whatsoever.I wonder if the producers of this film have actually every played Doom. The film did a fantastic job of incorporating none of the atmosphere of the games. It wasn't scary enough, it wasn't gory enough, and it wasn't evil enough.To summarise: it was crap. And I'm gutted >:-(

Being a vivid DooM gamer from as early as circa 1993 and knowing that ID software was involved in this movie, I had high expectations.But then the bad news started to appear... Rumours began emerging saying there would be no hell, no Mars and no teleports; all essential parts of the original games. "Ok, these are just rumours", I thought to myself, putting my faith in the games' development team, ID Software, which I thought would keep an eye on the production and keep it true to the games. Fortunately, later on it was confirmed that it would indeed be set on Mars and that kept my hopes up, even though they decided to go with B-rate actors.After seeing the movie I felt disappointed, realizing ID Software had completely sold out itself. Nothing in this movie is worth the title "DooM", except for the props, the monsters and the weapons. The movie to me felt like a Resident Evil clone set on Mars and if you ask me this movie should have been titled "Resident Evil: In Mars... with Bigger Guns... and Bigger Monsters".A major disappointment for me was that the producers decided to remove hell from the movie. The idea of the monsters originating from hell was an important aspect in the games. I'm guessing the producers decided to remove the hell part from the movie because of the large population of Christians in USA, thinking it would scare them away from the box office. Doing so, they completely betrayed the gamers, so their plan backfired badly.Viruses, cheesy one-liners, untalented actors, and not staying true to the original games' themes compel me to give this movie 3 stars. One for the creative FPS scene, one for the monsters and one for the props.If you ask me, this movie doesn't deserve to be called DooM!

Doom is not a masterpiece. However for what it is, a video game to movie franchise, it does a decent job. I was watching this film when suddenly my parents came in. They immediately sat down and watched the last 50 minutes with me. Surely that's an indication that the film itself wasn't too bad. My favourite part of the movie was the FPS scene. It showed a level of originality which has been absent in other Video game movies, such as the Resident Evil franchise. Another Pro was the casting of the Rock as Sarge and Karl Urban as Reaper. Both made decent performances in the movie.The level of action was decent and I was happy that the film branched out a bit further than the 90 minute restriction. Furthermore I particularly enjoyed the fact that the makers decided to use models and suits, similar to Alien rather than rely on CGI. It again shows a level of originality that implies the makers wanted the film to stand out and was not there just to make money.The cons were that overall the acting was not great. The other marines for example, other than The Rock and Urban, did not put in great performances and Rosamund Pike, I think was particularly bad. They seemed an ordinary group of guys thrust into battle. They just didn't seem to act like a group of elite, disciplined soldiers. It just didn't feel realistic. Another con is that the film was not particularly scary. The actual game is deemed to be one of the scariest games out there to play. So it feels an opportunity missed that the film was not a terrifying roller-coaster ride filled with suspense and was more like a variety of action sequences containing grim monsters.All in all Doom is a movie which is by no means perfect, is a decent film for what it is. A video game.

As a fan of the original Doom game for PC and a hater of most (if not all) video game to movie conversions, I was not expecting much.But, nothing in the world could prepare me for the cinematic catastrophe I was about to witness. When a game is turned into a film, one can only expect the story to be changed a little, but surely not to such a degree that the title is the only thing linking the two. Let me give you a little run down on the storyline differences.Game:- A secret research base on the moon accidentally creates a rift between the moon's surface and the shores of hell, people become possessed, satanic rituals take place, demons run riot and soon the base begins to merge with hell itself, the player (you) is the last surviving member of a team of marines sent to investigate (pretty basic stuff) Movie:- A research facility on Mars try to make a serum to make people into super humans. But it does not work on everyone, some people when infected mutate into large monsters that have detachable tongues which pass the infection onto others. Confused yet? There's more. Using what seems to be floating liquid mercury, The Rock and his team of equally talentless actors travel to mars to investigate a distress call. While there they discover what has happened and are all killed except for The Rock and some white guy who's name I can't remember, both of which become super humans and have to battle it out.Now that I'm done bitching about the differences between the film and the game, permit me to explain to you the other reasons why this seizure of a film is not worth your time.The dialogue is, how should i put it?, very structured, by this I mean that when the characters interact with one another, you are very aware that it has been scripted and there is no ad-libbing.The cinematography is clumsy. The camera angle never quite knows what it wants to do, and the lighting (where there is any) is just irritating.The filters are not subtle, they use lots of red (probably because it's set on Mars) and a fair bit of everyone's favourite green (because it's "post-Matrix") But the most laughable part has to be the five minute long first person sequence, which looks exactly like "Doom 3" on Xbox, the CGI in this scene is laughable (although possibly deliberate) and it ingeniously shows the big hulking monsters attacking the main character with a chainsaw which he later uses against what can only be described as a "boss" All in all, this film is terrible. Less of a film, more of a Labotomy on celluloid. Spend your £3.75 renting price on something more worthwhile, like paying Lenox Lewis to punch you in the face, it would be more fun I assure you!

And I don't mean that in a bad way. If you wanna watch Aliens but you last watched it a bit too recently, then watch Doom. Firstly, it will satisfy your xeno-bloodlust. Secondly, the next time you wanna watch Aliens, you will REALLY wanna watch Aliens. And that's a good thing right? Damn right!

When I first saw this movie, I left the theater with a vague feeling of disappointment. It wasn't until I saw the movie the second time I started laughing.With lines such as, "Semper Fi, Mother******" being the the the most brilliantly written parts of the movie, you know you've been swindled out of the five and half bucks it cost you to rent this train wreck. The dialogue that was intended to be clever and witty made me actually want to rape and kill the nearest nun or person of the cloth.The acting wasn't all that bad, but some of the characters seemed outrageously stereotypical. You have the radical Christian guy who slices open his arm for taking the lord's name in vain; you've got the creepy white guy who peddles drugs and makes 'hysterical' jokes like, "I'm afraid I'm, eh, gonna have to, uh, strip search you fine ladies;" and you've got the die-hard, no-nonsense sergeant who'll stop at nothing to get his men home safely. Of course, he does shoot one of them in the face for no particular reason.The Rock undergoes a complete and instantaneous personality change partway through the movie. He watches a video that shows doctors injecting a serum into a man strapped to a table. After watching this, The Rock screams, "I DIDN'T SEE SH*T! I AIN'T PAID TO SEE SH*T!" From that point on, The Rock decides it's his duty to murder all the civilians he comes across, when before that, he was a relatively nice guy.And if you expected this to be a scary movie, you can wipe your hopes right off your face. The scariest part of this movie is a monkey hiding in an air vent. Yeah, that's right. A monkey. In a vent. It jumps out and goes, "CREEWEAEAE!" Instead of getting scaring the hell out of people like it was intended to do, half the theater was laughing. What kind of lame movie needs a cheap Cat-In-The-Cupboard scare to keep it interesting?Doom. Oh, and if you were expecting this to be anything even close to the game, don't get your hopes up. The font of the main title was same, but after that the movie just wandered further and further into the swirling grey cloud of stupidity.Acting: 5/10 Dialouge: 2/10 Story: 4/10 Overall Rating: 4/10I would not recommend buying this movie. I would not recommend renting this movie. I wouldn't even recommend going to friend's house to watch their copy of the movie.

Doom was quite an entertaining video-game turned movie. It promised violence and it definitely delivered. While you did not have to think too much about what was going on, it did have a plot with some great twists. I expected a straight forward "shooter" movie, very similar to the game and, frankly, I expected it to be boring. I was anything but. The video game style of the movie was limited pretty much to one scene. One awesome scene that, if you felt the movie lacked in violence in any way, should fulfill your blood lust.Sarge (The Rock) is the leader of an elite USMC team which is sent to a space station on Mars to investigate a problem of disappearing scientists. Upon discovering most of the scientists dead, they soon realized they were not going to stay that way. I do not want to give away much more than that but there is more to this movie.Sarge's team consists of Destroyer (Deobia Oparei), the religious Goat (Ben Daniels), Duke (Raz Adoti), Portman (Richard Brake), The Kid (Al Weaver), Mac (Yao Chin) and John Grimm (Karl Urban), who happens to be the twin brother of one of the scientists, Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike).Doom started off pretty slow, but once the ball got rolling, it resembled the game more and more and kept the excitement up as well. All of these actors pulled off their parts to great avail. Really, how could they go wrong? I went into this movie with extremely low expectation. Especially after reading some of the reviews so I was very pleasantly surprised. I can recommend this movie to those who love a good, bloody action movie. Basically, if you can relate to Sin City, then Doom is also the movie for you. 9/10

I saw DOOM yesterday and I'm completely disappointed.There is no connection with the game at all. And who needs another genetic mutation in a movie. This is no DOOM. This is just a little different resident evil movie. And resident evil was a lot better (first part, not the second).Only one scene in a movie is good. And that is a 3D scene, but it is a shame because it lasted only for 3 minutes or so. Everything else is a complete disaster.What else could you expect from a movie that was made in two months.What a shame!

This is another AvP. A major disappointment. The source material was pretty rich with a lot of possibilities. So much could have been done with it. The film LOOKED fine, but the pace was so slow and the character's were never really developed. Alien is a great example of character development in a movie of this type.The whole demonic/gates of hell thing is ditched in favour of some genetic experimentation, taking away the real core of the whole original Doom VG storyline. I found myself actually bored by this movie and not caring what happened to the people in it.Also, I don't ever recall seeing a film starring 'The Rock' that I could sit through without fast forwarding.Wait for the DVD and rent it.

I must say I expected a lot worse, given all the very indecent films being made inspired by computer games, and especially this one, cause it is a game I played to death - pardon the pun - 10 years ago.I was entertained, and I didn't crumble my toes as much as I usually do.I usually dislike The Rock, cause I usually see him as a boneheaded wrestler with no acting potential what-so-ever, but in this film I must say he works out fantastically. Granted, it doesn't take a DeNiro to play the part, but he does it well and very convincingly. Cudos for that, I am even thinking about checking some of his new films out as well not.Of course, I have to find something that annoyed me, and it was called "Rosamund Pike"....my god, how can an actress this boring and express less ever get a part in a film? I grabbed myself several times wondering this question. He seriously stinks.But - to be honest, I think she was the only downer in this film. I didn't expect Oscar material and obviously that's not what I got either, but I got a lot of action and enjoyed all of it, especially the game-inspired shoot'em down/up scene, quite awesome carried out.Cudos to everything...apart from Rosamund Pike 7/10

OK, where must I begin. I might as well point out the bad things first in respect to the game. Now, what the hell was with the whole 24th chromosome thing? Makes sense to me, yes. However, what the hell happened to, well, HELL? These monsters in the movie were respectable enough to relate to the imps and hell knights in the game, but WHERE THE HELL ARE THE FIRE AND PLAMSA BALLS?! Where are the flying lost souls? Where are the CACODEMONS? where's the F**kin demon lord and spider demon for crying out loud. Maybe I'm being a little vain and asking for too much, but the monsters in the game were different breeds, and all came from hell, not mutated. The whole plot was actually somewhat too similar to Resident Evil. It p*s*e* me off. They completely abandoned all that the game was based on plot wise.Now, as for the characters, I'm glad that they made it a team effort in this, and the characters were funny at times, but they seemed so underdone, except for of course, Reaper and Sarge, even Rosamund Pike couldn't add to anything in the film. I know I'm being picky, but blood and guts game? One man fighting to stop hell (or team effort)? Hello?The good things were that they stayed on Mars, they had the BFG in it, but it was so underused. I think the highlight of it was the first person thing, which I feel quite gypped on because of the short amount of time that we see it. I feel like they just put it in there for the game fans so they'd have their glory, and I am a die hard doom fan, but i feel somewhat insulted by it. They have had plenty of technology available to them to make this so much better, but they didn't use what they could've had available to them. Maybe if ID worked with them on it, it wouldn't have been such a disappointment, but this was just insulting to us gamers once again. however, a SMALL improvement when it comes to other VG movies. The action was however enjoyable, and the fight at the end made it fun, but I almost felt like Rock had to do it to show off that he still has his smack-down glory. Oh well, lets see if they don't butcher Halo. (God Forbid)5/10

I never got to see this movie in the theater and recently got a chance to see the uncut edition. Honestly my very first impression of the movie was "this is cool". Then my fanboyism got a hold of me and realized it was not doom. Honestly if this movie would have been called "UAC Marines", "Viral Apocalypse" or something else random, this movie would have done A LOT better. It was actually really good for a sci-fi movie. Much in the vein of Resident Evil meets Mission To Mars. The thing that really made this movie not a movie about DOOM however was the lack of cohesive elements to the game story. In the game it's all about hell and demons and weird psycho doctors wanting to be more psycho. The movie focuses on an ancient race designing a machine called the ARC, this machine makes direct transport to mars possible. There seems to be a problem on mars and the UAC Marines are sent in to investigate. The next about an hour and forty five minutes is all about trying to figure out what happened and destroy the threat if any. It's your very standard sci-fi story but it achieves what it's meant to do. Entertain you for a moment. The movies main downfall is it is only LOOSELY based around the game that everyone wanted to see on film. However to appease the fanboys(girls?) out there DOOM does have a very unique experience visually in the form of a (about 5-10 minute) segment where the camera is completely shot in first person perspective. Which having never seen this EVER done in a film was really neat. A bit out of place where they chose to do it in my opinion but cool nonetheless. Overall if you want to see a really interesting take on a sci-fi movie checkout DOOM, if you are wanting a direct translation of the video game, I suggest you just keep playing the video game.Visuals: 7 Sound: 9 Gore To Idiocy Factory: 3 (It's there and does what it needs to do. Not over the top or retarded to the point you just wonder why it's there in the first place) Cliché Catch Phrases: 5 (Standard Sci-Fi) Overall Score: 6

I have to say for a movie based on a video game it was not bad. Acting is pretty much what you'd expect, special effects are a little better than the actual game :/ Surprisingly though they did manage to come up with some semblance of a plot, so it wasn't a complete waste of time. Interesting direction, and if you've played the game before you can't help but laugh at how well cast the main character is, the resemblance is undeniable. Whatever, any excuse to look at The Rock for awhile will do. The gore was not at all believable (what did I expect?)a good movie for younger teen boys though, as they kept the content appropriate for their target market. I wouldn't watch it again, but it was alright.

I, unlike other people, did not find this movie to be a disappointment. I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. A movie based on a video game will never have an amazing story, or exceptionally good acting worth an academy award. A movie like this will have good action, reasonable suspense, and be the type of movie you can watch again and enjoy it just as much as the first time. For the most part, this movie lives up to those expectations. It has good action sequences, it is a re-watchable movie, and the storyline isn't quite as bad as I thought it would be. Sure, they changed stuff from the video game during the transition, but it still worked, and you cant expect everything in the video game to work as a movie, they had to change some things to help the cinematic view of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie with solid action sequences and anyone who is looking for some fun with their friends.

I agree with MxSChizo if you look at other game to film adaptations they tend to follow the core plot from the game this movie does not. If you have never played the Doom video games before and have no idea what it's about you will mostly likely rate it higher (4-6stars maybe). The Rock fans may not be happy with lots of hard stairs and emotionless facial expressions like normal but pretty much none of backward tongue and cheek comedy that his had with previous roles which make him likable. All the actors play fairly weak roles as there was no real depth to the characters, there was potential the Grimm siblings (played by Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike) but I was left wanting to know more. All in all to me it seemed like after the first 10 minutes the rest was filler till the last 15-20 minutes.It becomes obvious that no thought or regard was there for the original story (from the game(s)) or fans and that it was more or less not worth making other then to cash in on a legendary name using an inferior product.

Would I call Doom a good movie? Not really. Do I still enjoy it? Yes!For me the interaction between the actors is working pretty well and the movie delivers something resembling the game Doom in terms of scenario. We have some of the monsters that can be found in the game even though they're not really demons but something else.In addition the action scenes are pretty entertaining and especially the first person shooter style scene is very well done.Does the movie still have problems? Definitely. The characters themselves are rather stupid in their behavior and overall pretty flat. The story writing as well is not great.Still watching Karl Urban and The Rock going at each other is pretty fun.

*Warning* This review contains mild spoilers to the GAME, but not the movie.A dig in the nevada desert have found a portal to an ancient city on mars. Since then, scientists have struggled 20 years to find out more about the civilization that built the city and why they disappeared.Apparently they found something. In an emergency transmission sent from the science facility on mars a head scientist explains that there is a "level 5 breach" and quarantine procedures must be implemented immediately. A squad of elite soldiers are sent to the science facility on Mars to protect and retrieve property and make sure quarantine is kept. What they find is naturally more than they are trained and equipped for.This is another game that made it into the silver screen, and the DOOM franchise isn't exactly known for it's multi-depth story lines. This made me seek out and watch this movie with plenty of ice in my stomach, ready to forgive the producers for mistakes they made.And mistakes were made. The greatest one was of course to change the entire plot. As a gamer who put more value in story than the action, I would personally say that the DOOM3 storyline was better than the movies (completely changed) storyline. In the game the city plays a central role. In the movie you never leave the work areas, you never get to see the old ruins. The city isn't even mentioned beyond the intro. Beyond 2 <10 second scenes, you do not see the Mars exterior. You barely register that these events take place on Mars, not on earth. The artifacts that played a central role in the game is not mentioned or present in the movie. The entire "Hell is loose" plot was completely cut away, the events of the movie blamed onto something *COMPLETELY* different. The theme "one man against hell" became "a few men and their issues". The ghost of the little girl (one of the games scarier parts) did not make it to the move.DOOM3 was also a horror experience playing both on achluophobia (fear of darkness) and Monophobia (fear of being alone), this was an aspect missing in the movie where areas was lit and the characters was always going at least two and two. I almost think the movie could have been better if they hired less actors and put more money on storywriters.Another aspect completely gone is the ambient red tone of being on mars, something that could have added a more artistic flavor to the movie. Except for very short moments in the beginning of the movie you never see that these events in fact take place on mars.I was not happy to see the storyline almost completely changed and the horror downscaled to almost not scary at all with nothing better added to it. There are no deep questions asked here, no philosophical submessage to the audience to go home thinking about. This is a lighthearted actionmovie and that's it.The most faithful part (to the game) is the labs and the monsters. he developers who made the game gave the areas/monsters/weapons an unique design that wouldn't have been right to move away from. If you care zero about the plot, then yes this is DOOM.There's also the first person sequence in which we get to follow a series of events through the eyes of a soldier when he runs around and shoot monsters in corridors. It was fun, although I would say that it failed to capture me. I was mostly annoyed with the choice of music and it could have been more scary.I see some ways this movie could have been made better with the material it's based on, but I did not expect it. At least the action is well done. If you want 2 hours of entertainment that wont change your world, DOOM offers just that. If you do not watch many movies and want some extra quality when spending time on one, you can jump this one.Game-movies so far are between "awful" and "ok". This one was "ok".

OK, we are all hearing how Doom the movie is a complete sellout etc, but still this is an enjoyable movie. The Rock as Sarge is absolutely perfect! i just couldn't imagine Karl Urban doing a better job then The Rock when it comes to Sarge. Although many have branded this film "Resident Evil in Space" and yeah it is but that doesn't subtract from the film at all. The 1st person scene was especially pulled off well and will give you some giggles (c'mon who didn't laugh?).The Score is absolutely awesome and sets the atmosphere perfectly! too me this film had an old school 80's horror feel to it which i felt made it that more enjoyable (we got lots of uncensored over the top gore which now we don't get enough of). Overall don't judge this movie till you see it because it is a lot better then people rate it unless your looking to find something thats a 100% identical too its source material (Doom 3) then i'd advise you to not watch this film because some of it has been completely rewritten from its original context hence no hell. Overall a lot better then what i was expecting too see

Oh. My. God.There are good reasons I voted for a one, mind you the graphics may be nice and flashy and there may be lots of guns involved, but that doesn't even come close to redeeming this movie's fatal error - The raping of Doom.Doom was about an aerospace agency experimenting with dimensional gateways and thus opening a portal to Hell, spilling demons out that soon started warring with mankind.This movie, is just another genetic experiment sprinter zombie movie, as if we didn't have enough, and the classical zombie wasn't defiled plenty. Still that isn't nearly as much of an atrocity as completely discarding everything that's Doom, or well, they have retained some resemblances with Doom as they said. Resemblances like them having guns, and them having to shoot bad guys. It's nothing but another shite movie about a bunch of roughnecks with big boomsticks fighting with more sprinter zombies, hence I vote to rename this movie to "Resident Evil 2: RE on Mars" and stop this good for nothing possé of "actors and scriptwriters" from dragging along with Doom's fame because they can't produce anything good of their own.

I just rewatched Doom (17 years later) and was happily surprised at how good the film was and how much I enjoyed it.Urban is particularly good.I enjoyed the music and sound fx, however the visual fx, particularly the for the beasties, could have been sharper.I loved the part of the film that goes in to FPS mode, super effective and really fun.The weakest part of the film, the character of Pinky. He comes across as a bit of a flog and adds zilch to the movie.For some reason this movie was considered a bit of a failure but as I stated I liked it and had plenty of fun watching it. Give it a go :)

This movie should have been the "Aliens" of the 21st century. The Phobos base should have appeared dank and deserted, save the occasional body. The atmosphere should have built to an unbearable, silent tension. Then, and only then, the hideous creatures from hell should have started climbing out of walls and from under floors, and devouring the marines.But instead, the set of the base was boring (the film looked like it was shot in a single corridor). The atmosphere wasn't scary enough. The monsters were, frankly, pathetic. A guy in a rubber alien suit covered in KY jelly to make him look slimy may have worked 30 years ago, but not now. Where were the horrific bio-mechanical perversions of nature that characterised doom? (i.e. Spider Demon). Where was the demonic imagery? The torsos hanging from spikes in the ceiling? The five pointed stars painted on the floor in blood?The plot had nothing to do with the original games. The whole "24th chromosome" thing was actually less believable than a portal to hell, and undermined the tension when you found out that the creatures were actually human (once).There was no point to the film. No objective. Just people walking round corridors with guns. That may make a good game, but a film needs more than that. Even in Doom 3 (the game) there is a series of objectives, i.e. crossing the base to get to the transmitter and call for help. That's what this game needed - an objective for the marines to accomplish other than killing things. Without this, the film rambles on and the dialogue is superfluous, with no influence on the storyline whatsoever.I wonder if the producers of this film have actually every played Doom. The film did a fantastic job of incorporating none of the atmosphere of the games. It wasn't scary enough, it wasn't gory enough, and it wasn't evil enough.To summarise: it was crap. And I'm gutted >:-(

Computer gamers get your freak on. Doom explodes on the silver screen. In 2026, there is a frantic call for help from a research station in the Nevada desert on Mars. Something has gone wrong...communications have faded to white noise. A special team of mercenary Marines led by 'The Sarge'(The Rock)and John Grimm(Karl Urban), armed to the hilt, get the mission to quarantine the research station and adjoining archaeological dig. Found alive is Grimm's sister Samantha(Rosamund Pike), a researcher trying to download important info before it gets destroyed. Lurking in the dank and dark are huge creatures killing at will. After losing most of the team, the heavy artillery is brought out and DNA is splattered in every possible direction.Special effects are great. Uncensored gore, raw and stomach turning is riveting. Rapid and abundant gunfire from awesome weaponry is highly effective. Also in the cast: Ben Daniels, Richard Brake, Robert Russell, Razaaq Adoti and Yao Chin.

Being a vivid DooM gamer from as early as circa 1993 and knowing that ID software was involved in this movie, I had high expectations.But then the bad news started to appear... Rumours began emerging saying there would be no hell, no Mars and no teleports; all essential parts of the original games. "Ok, these are just rumours", I thought to myself, putting my faith in the games' development team, ID Software, which I thought would keep an eye on the production and keep it true to the games. Fortunately, later on it was confirmed that it would indeed be set on Mars and that kept my hopes up, even though they decided to go with B-rate actors.After seeing the movie I felt disappointed, realizing ID Software had completely sold out itself. Nothing in this movie is worth the title "DooM", except for the props, the monsters and the weapons. The movie to me felt like a Resident Evil clone set on Mars and if you ask me this movie should have been titled "Resident Evil: In Mars... with Bigger Guns... and Bigger Monsters".A major disappointment for me was that the producers decided to remove hell from the movie. The idea of the monsters originating from hell was an important aspect in the games. I'm guessing the producers decided to remove the hell part from the movie because of the large population of Christians in USA, thinking it would scare them away from the box office. Doing so, they completely betrayed the gamers, so their plan backfired badly.Viruses, cheesy one-liners, untalented actors, and not staying true to the original games' themes compel me to give this movie 3 stars. One for the creative FPS scene, one for the monsters and one for the props.If you ask me, this movie doesn't deserve to be called DooM!

Doom is not a masterpiece. However for what it is, a video game to movie franchise, it does a decent job. I was watching this film when suddenly my parents came in. They immediately sat down and watched the last 50 minutes with me. Surely that's an indication that the film itself wasn't too bad. My favourite part of the movie was the FPS scene. It showed a level of originality which has been absent in other Video game movies, such as the Resident Evil franchise. Another Pro was the casting of the Rock as Sarge and Karl Urban as Reaper. Both made decent performances in the movie.The level of action was decent and I was happy that the film branched out a bit further than the 90 minute restriction. Furthermore I particularly enjoyed the fact that the makers decided to use models and suits, similar to Alien rather than rely on CGI. It again shows a level of originality that implies the makers wanted the film to stand out and was not there just to make money.The cons were that overall the acting was not great. The other marines for example, other than The Rock and Urban, did not put in great performances and Rosamund Pike, I think was particularly bad. They seemed an ordinary group of guys thrust into battle. They just didn't seem to act like a group of elite, disciplined soldiers. It just didn't feel realistic. Another con is that the film was not particularly scary. The actual game is deemed to be one of the scariest games out there to play. So it feels an opportunity missed that the film was not a terrifying roller-coaster ride filled with suspense and was more like a variety of action sequences containing grim monsters.All in all Doom is a movie which is by no means perfect, is a decent film for what it is. A video game.

As a fan of the original Doom game for PC and a hater of most (if not all) video game to movie conversions, I was not expecting much.But, nothing in the world could prepare me for the cinematic catastrophe I was about to witness. When a game is turned into a film, one can only expect the story to be changed a little, but surely not to such a degree that the title is the only thing linking the two. Let me give you a little run down on the storyline differences.Game:- A secret research base on the moon accidentally creates a rift between the moon's surface and the shores of hell, people become possessed, satanic rituals take place, demons run riot and soon the base begins to merge with hell itself, the player (you) is the last surviving member of a team of marines sent to investigate (pretty basic stuff) Movie:- A research facility on Mars try to make a serum to make people into super humans. But it does not work on everyone, some people when infected mutate into large monsters that have detachable tongues which pass the infection onto others. Confused yet? There's more. Using what seems to be floating liquid mercury, The Rock and his team of equally talentless actors travel to mars to investigate a distress call. While there they discover what has happened and are all killed except for The Rock and some white guy who's name I can't remember, both of which become super humans and have to battle it out.Now that I'm done bitching about the differences between the film and the game, permit me to explain to you the other reasons why this seizure of a film is not worth your time.The dialogue is, how should i put it?, very structured, by this I mean that when the characters interact with one another, you are very aware that it has been scripted and there is no ad-libbing.The cinematography is clumsy. The camera angle never quite knows what it wants to do, and the lighting (where there is any) is just irritating.The filters are not subtle, they use lots of red (probably because it's set on Mars) and a fair bit of everyone's favourite green (because it's "post-Matrix") But the most laughable part has to be the five minute long first person sequence, which looks exactly like "Doom 3" on Xbox, the CGI in this scene is laughable (although possibly deliberate) and it ingeniously shows the big hulking monsters attacking the main character with a chainsaw which he later uses against what can only be described as a "boss" All in all, this film is terrible. Less of a film, more of a Labotomy on celluloid. Spend your £3.75 renting price on something more worthwhile, like paying Lenox Lewis to punch you in the face, it would be more fun I assure you!

In a film world where so little video games are made into films with some kind of quality, DOOM is exceptional! It's not fantastic but it's not bad either as it has a few twists in it and the creatures really aren't bad. As a matter of fact a few of them really do represent what is in the video games. Especially the 1993 and 94 - 3.5 games you played on the pc back in the day. And the actors where very good as well.You'd think filmmakers would be able to make some really good stories out of these games, but for some strange reason the majority of video game films are basically lousy! I would site the Resident Evil films that came from the video game concept, they seemed to have mastered a look and story of those games.

And I don't mean that in a bad way. If you wanna watch Aliens but you last watched it a bit too recently, then watch Doom. Firstly, it will satisfy your xeno-bloodlust. Secondly, the next time you wanna watch Aliens, you will REALLY wanna watch Aliens. And that's a good thing right? Damn right!

When I first saw this movie, I left the theater with a vague feeling of disappointment. It wasn't until I saw the movie the second time I started laughing.With lines such as, "Semper Fi, Mother******" being the the the most brilliantly written parts of the movie, you know you've been swindled out of the five and half bucks it cost you to rent this train wreck. The dialogue that was intended to be clever and witty made me actually want to rape and kill the nearest nun or person of the cloth.The acting wasn't all that bad, but some of the characters seemed outrageously stereotypical. You have the radical Christian guy who slices open his arm for taking the lord's name in vain; you've got the creepy white guy who peddles drugs and makes 'hysterical' jokes like, "I'm afraid I'm, eh, gonna have to, uh, strip search you fine ladies;" and you've got the die-hard, no-nonsense sergeant who'll stop at nothing to get his men home safely. Of course, he does shoot one of them in the face for no particular reason.The Rock undergoes a complete and instantaneous personality change partway through the movie. He watches a video that shows doctors injecting a serum into a man strapped to a table. After watching this, The Rock screams, "I DIDN'T SEE SH*T! I AIN'T PAID TO SEE SH*T!" From that point on, The Rock decides it's his duty to murder all the civilians he comes across, when before that, he was a relatively nice guy.And if you expected this to be a scary movie, you can wipe your hopes right off your face. The scariest part of this movie is a monkey hiding in an air vent. Yeah, that's right. A monkey. In a vent. It jumps out and goes, "CREEWEAEAE!" Instead of getting scaring the hell out of people like it was intended to do, half the theater was laughing. What kind of lame movie needs a cheap Cat-In-The-Cupboard scare to keep it interesting?Doom. Oh, and if you were expecting this to be anything even close to the game, don't get your hopes up. The font of the main title was same, but after that the movie just wandered further and further into the swirling grey cloud of stupidity.Acting: 5/10 Dialouge: 2/10 Story: 4/10 Overall Rating: 4/10I would not recommend buying this movie. I would not recommend renting this movie. I wouldn't even recommend going to friend's house to watch their copy of the movie.

Doom was quite an entertaining video-game turned movie. It promised violence and it definitely delivered. While you did not have to think too much about what was going on, it did have a plot with some great twists. I expected a straight forward "shooter" movie, very similar to the game and, frankly, I expected it to be boring. I was anything but. The video game style of the movie was limited pretty much to one scene. One awesome scene that, if you felt the movie lacked in violence in any way, should fulfill your blood lust.Sarge (The Rock) is the leader of an elite USMC team which is sent to a space station on Mars to investigate a problem of disappearing scientists. Upon discovering most of the scientists dead, they soon realized they were not going to stay that way. I do not want to give away much more than that but there is more to this movie.Sarge's team consists of Destroyer (Deobia Oparei), the religious Goat (Ben Daniels), Duke (Raz Adoti), Portman (Richard Brake), The Kid (Al Weaver), Mac (Yao Chin) and John Grimm (Karl Urban), who happens to be the twin brother of one of the scientists, Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike).Doom started off pretty slow, but once the ball got rolling, it resembled the game more and more and kept the excitement up as well. All of these actors pulled off their parts to great avail. Really, how could they go wrong? I went into this movie with extremely low expectation. Especially after reading some of the reviews so I was very pleasantly surprised. I can recommend this movie to those who love a good, bloody action movie. Basically, if you can relate to Sin City, then Doom is also the movie for you. 9/10

I saw DOOM yesterday and I'm completely disappointed.There is no connection with the game at all. And who needs another genetic mutation in a movie. This is no DOOM. This is just a little different resident evil movie. And resident evil was a lot better (first part, not the second).Only one scene in a movie is good. And that is a 3D scene, but it is a shame because it lasted only for 3 minutes or so. Everything else is a complete disaster.What else could you expect from a movie that was made in two months.What a shame!

So many people everywhere have some sort of Doom memory. Whether it be playing with friends, siblings, or hell even family, Doom seems to be something that anyone who's played enjoys. If anyones seen the film Alien and Aliens -- the difference between the original dooms and Doom 3 is exactly the same. Doom 3 being more like alien, more horror with less action, and the originals like Aliens, more action, with some horror.Now the film review. After seeing my title, "Faithfull no? Good film? Yes." your probably wondering how it could be unfaithful to the games and still a good film at the same time -- i'll explain.Anyone who's played any doom game as much as I have(Which is a lot) will DEFFINTLY be disappointed in this film. It's got light rough elements of the original games in there yes, but not enough. Lets not even talk plot for a moment. Say the whole 'hell' involvement thing didn't even matter. Think demons, think weapons, think action/horror. Thats what dooms always been about more then anything, right? Right. Which is why this film comes to a disappointment.Lets talk demons first: They included 4 of the demons from the doom games, The zombie, The imp, the pinky, and the baron/hell knight whichever you want to call it, it really dose't matter in this case. The zombies behaved well, like zombies. You don't see much of them, but you see them none the less and they never do crap. You just see them die. Thats it. The imps and barons? They don't shoot fireballs anymore sadly. The barons use brute force, while the imps either just scratch or attack you with their tongue to turn you into an imp, IF your souls 24th chromosome is declared "Evil." If thats not bad enough, you don't even get a good look at them or see them very much! The pinky, he was in one very short scene, and pretty much just acted like a slow CGI monster, so it was kinda obvious. It was fun to see it get slashed with the chainsaw, one of the few moments that everyone loved in doom. Though, in doom 3 they at least explained why chainsaws were on mars..Weapons: You see the rocket launcher picked up, but never used. You see the shotgun shot ONCE in a very dark scene, meaning you see flashes and hear a shotgun sound and thats it. The big mini gun/chain gun was used ONCE to shoot a monkey. Other then that you see the machine gun used the WHOLE time, and the BFG used twice. The double barrel shotgun and plasma gun don't even get a mention! The chainsaw just happened to be on a random table and used to kill the pinky. The pistol was used a few times. Shooting wise - this film was dull. The first person section was really the only place you felt doomish, other then the 2 times the BFG was used. Not to mention the BFG color changed from green to blue..The action / horror: You don't see much of it. You see some action here and there, but it's mostly random. You don't see much shooting and stuff dieing. You do, but it's dark not very gory and hard to see. The horror? Absent in this film sorry to say. They tried 1-2 cheap scares, which didn't even work..Plot: I'm not going to go into this. Only one thing to say : Not doom. The plot of hell and demons was taken out, and replaced with a genetics plot. Not much else to say.Now i've explained why it's very unlike doom, i'm going to say one more thing on the matter, and thats that the soundtrack was nicely done(Remiended me of the original doom music sort of..) and the sets were constructed mostly very well and close to the game.The next part of this review: Good as a movie.Anyone who's never played a doom game, can DEFFINTLY enjoy this. Anyone who's never played video games: Can ENJOY this. They won't understand the FPS section maybe, but you can still enjoy it none the less. As a sci fi film, it's not the best out there no, but it's pretty well done, and if you don't see it as seeing Doom the movie, and just some sci fi movie on mars, you can DEFFINTLY enjoy the film.The plot, is out there yeah, but it explains why some people are infected and others are not. It explains a lot about chromosomes, and hey, they even included an ancient civilization bit, which was in the game, AND makes sense in this plot. Don't worry about knowing nothing about the games - it won't matter. You'll be able to understand it all.Overall, you can defiantly enjoy the little action mixed with the strange sci fi plot, into a nicely mixed film that lets not refer to as doom.My final judgment: If your a doom fan see it, but don't expect to like it. You may enjoy it as a film, but you won't like it as doom. If your a video game fan, see it, you'll probably find yourself enjoying it. If you like Sci-Fi, give it a go, if you haven't seen Sernity yet, which is the only other sci fi playing to my knowledge at the moment. If you just want a movie to see on a Friday night with some action, go for it. If your looking for a in depth rich story lined sci fi action combined film, go rent aliens..I gave this a 6/10, because though unlike doom, it was still a well done film, and maybe one day Hollywood will learn to make a successful video game adaptation..

This is another AvP. A major disappointment. The source material was pretty rich with a lot of possibilities. So much could have been done with it. The film LOOKED fine, but the pace was so slow and the character's were never really developed. Alien is a great example of character development in a movie of this type.The whole demonic/gates of hell thing is ditched in favour of some genetic experimentation, taking away the real core of the whole original Doom VG storyline. I found myself actually bored by this movie and not caring what happened to the people in it.Also, I don't ever recall seeing a film starring 'The Rock' that I could sit through without fast forwarding.Wait for the DVD and rent it.

I must say I expected a lot worse, given all the very indecent films being made inspired by computer games, and especially this one, cause it is a game I played to death - pardon the pun - 10 years ago.I was entertained, and I didn't crumble my toes as much as I usually do.I usually dislike The Rock, cause I usually see him as a boneheaded wrestler with no acting potential what-so-ever, but in this film I must say he works out fantastically. Granted, it doesn't take a DeNiro to play the part, but he does it well and very convincingly. Cudos for that, I am even thinking about checking some of his new films out as well not.Of course, I have to find something that annoyed me, and it was called "Rosamund Pike"....my god, how can an actress this boring and express less ever get a part in a film? I grabbed myself several times wondering this question. He seriously stinks.But - to be honest, I think she was the only downer in this film. I didn't expect Oscar material and obviously that's not what I got either, but I got a lot of action and enjoyed all of it, especially the game-inspired shoot'em down/up scene, quite awesome carried out.Cudos to everything...apart from Rosamund Pike 7/10

OK, where must I begin. I might as well point out the bad things first in respect to the game. Now, what the hell was with the whole 24th chromosome thing? Makes sense to me, yes. However, what the hell happened to, well, HELL? These monsters in the movie were respectable enough to relate to the imps and hell knights in the game, but WHERE THE HELL ARE THE FIRE AND PLAMSA BALLS?! Where are the flying lost souls? Where are the CACODEMONS? where's the F**kin demon lord and spider demon for crying out loud. Maybe I'm being a little vain and asking for too much, but the monsters in the game were different breeds, and all came from hell, not mutated. The whole plot was actually somewhat too similar to Resident Evil. It p*s*e* me off. They completely abandoned all that the game was based on plot wise.Now, as for the characters, I'm glad that they made it a team effort in this, and the characters were funny at times, but they seemed so underdone, except for of course, Reaper and Sarge, even Rosamund Pike couldn't add to anything in the film. I know I'm being picky, but blood and guts game? One man fighting to stop hell (or team effort)? Hello?The good things were that they stayed on Mars, they had the BFG in it, but it was so underused. I think the highlight of it was the first person thing, which I feel quite gypped on because of the short amount of time that we see it. I feel like they just put it in there for the game fans so they'd have their glory, and I am a die hard doom fan, but i feel somewhat insulted by it. They have had plenty of technology available to them to make this so much better, but they didn't use what they could've had available to them. Maybe if ID worked with them on it, it wouldn't have been such a disappointment, but this was just insulting to us gamers once again. however, a SMALL improvement when it comes to other VG movies. The action was however enjoyable, and the fight at the end made it fun, but I almost felt like Rock had to do it to show off that he still has his smack-down glory. Oh well, lets see if they don't butcher Halo. (God Forbid)5/10

I never got to see this movie in the theater and recently got a chance to see the uncut edition. Honestly my very first impression of the movie was "this is cool". Then my fanboyism got a hold of me and realized it was not doom. Honestly if this movie would have been called "UAC Marines", "Viral Apocalypse" or something else random, this movie would have done A LOT better. It was actually really good for a sci-fi movie. Much in the vein of Resident Evil meets Mission To Mars. The thing that really made this movie not a movie about DOOM however was the lack of cohesive elements to the game story. In the game it's all about hell and demons and weird psycho doctors wanting to be more psycho. The movie focuses on an ancient race designing a machine called the ARC, this machine makes direct transport to mars possible. There seems to be a problem on mars and the UAC Marines are sent in to investigate. The next about an hour and forty five minutes is all about trying to figure out what happened and destroy the threat if any. It's your very standard sci-fi story but it achieves what it's meant to do. Entertain you for a moment. The movies main downfall is it is only LOOSELY based around the game that everyone wanted to see on film. However to appease the fanboys(girls?) out there DOOM does have a very unique experience visually in the form of a (about 5-10 minute) segment where the camera is completely shot in first person perspective. Which having never seen this EVER done in a film was really neat. A bit out of place where they chose to do it in my opinion but cool nonetheless. Overall if you want to see a really interesting take on a sci-fi movie checkout DOOM, if you are wanting a direct translation of the video game, I suggest you just keep playing the video game.Visuals: 7 Sound: 9 Gore To Idiocy Factory: 3 (It's there and does what it needs to do. Not over the top or retarded to the point you just wonder why it's there in the first place) Cliché Catch Phrases: 5 (Standard Sci-Fi) Overall Score: 6

I have to say for a movie based on a video game it was not bad. Acting is pretty much what you'd expect, special effects are a little better than the actual game :/ Surprisingly though they did manage to come up with some semblance of a plot, so it wasn't a complete waste of time. Interesting direction, and if you've played the game before you can't help but laugh at how well cast the main character is, the resemblance is undeniable. Whatever, any excuse to look at The Rock for awhile will do. The gore was not at all believable (what did I expect?)a good movie for younger teen boys though, as they kept the content appropriate for their target market. I wouldn't watch it again, but it was alright.

I, unlike other people, did not find this movie to be a disappointment. I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. A movie based on a video game will never have an amazing story, or exceptionally good acting worth an academy award. A movie like this will have good action, reasonable suspense, and be the type of movie you can watch again and enjoy it just as much as the first time. For the most part, this movie lives up to those expectations. It has good action sequences, it is a re-watchable movie, and the storyline isn't quite as bad as I thought it would be. Sure, they changed stuff from the video game during the transition, but it still worked, and you cant expect everything in the video game to work as a movie, they had to change some things to help the cinematic view of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie with solid action sequences and anyone who is looking for some fun with their friends.

My expectations for this one were quite low: Just a cheap remake of a shooter computer game. Watched it on Netflix because "I had already paid for it". But it was not so bad at all. Cast was interesting with some good picks, the character buildup of the marine team better and more carefully don than in the average action/horror flick and the atmosphere of the game well captured. Looked a lot like Doom 3 from the good old days.

I agree with MxSChizo if you look at other game to film adaptations they tend to follow the core plot from the game this movie does not. If you have never played the Doom video games before and have no idea what it's about you will mostly likely rate it higher (4-6stars maybe). The Rock fans may not be happy with lots of hard stairs and emotionless facial expressions like normal but pretty much none of backward tongue and cheek comedy that his had with previous roles which make him likable. All the actors play fairly weak roles as there was no real depth to the characters, there was potential the Grimm siblings (played by Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike) but I was left wanting to know more. All in all to me it seemed like after the first 10 minutes the rest was filler till the last 15-20 minutes.It becomes obvious that no thought or regard was there for the original story (from the game(s)) or fans and that it was more or less not worth making other then to cash in on a legendary name using an inferior product.
