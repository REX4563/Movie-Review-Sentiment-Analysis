I usually don't like Martin Lawrence and I find his anti-white humor to be quite offensive as well as his string of bad movies. But compared to his other movie of 2003 (that would be the shockingly awful Bad Boys II), National Security is a rather easy-going and light-hearted cop comedy flick with quite a few good laughs. A lot of them, surprisingly, coming from Lawrence himself.Hank Rafferty (Steve Zahn)is a cop who is unfairly thrown in jail for apparently beating a black suspect (Lawrence) who just got kicked out of Police Academy. With his career in tatters he emerges from the slammer with only one job opportunity available; a lowly guard for a lowly security company. Determined to follow up on the big case he was involved with before serving time, he crosses the path of fellow security guard Earl Montgomery (Lawrence again) and the two reignite their old conflict.The old love/hate buddy thing may be old and the plot may be silly but it's a great excuse for loads of action set-pieces and humor. The potentially dangerous comedy of black vs white never becomes offensive and is handled with such lightness that it never becomes an issue. Both men have their failings and bonuses and are as equal as each other. You really do feel a great partnership between them despite their arguing and fights.Give National Security a try. It's slick and fast-moving and is a helluva lot better than Bad Boys II. You'll probably be surprised at how funny Martin Lawrence is. I was.The DVD is in great looking 1.85:1 widescreen with pretty good Dolby 5.1 sound. The scenes where Lawrence uses his automatic pistol really pack a heavy punch in the .1 LFE channel. The usual deleted scenes and commentary are included on the DVD but I was surprised the extended ending wasn't included in the film. It would have been better with it.

I'm always amazed when I look back at how underrated this movie is. 6/10 is understandable, but anything lower is just now fair.There are mountains of good comedy within the show, mostly prompted by Martin Lawrence's antics.I always look back at how many jokes people remember from a comedy and if it's more than 2, it usually means it was successful. They may have not been PC, they may not have been witty, but they got the job done.I've seen a lot more critically acclaimed movies that I struggle to remember at least one funny scene from.

Martin Lawrence was absolutely funny in this movie,, he had so many great one liners I couldn't stop laughing the entire movie,, yeah the buddy cop genre has pretty much worn out it's welcome in the last 20 years. but this one is refreshing. Steve Zahn who I never heard of was also funny at times.. the main story of the movie is that our main character arrests a man and turns out he wasn't even guilty,, together they are thrown together to go up against some bad guys , and have a lot of fun in doing so.. yes there are some aspects that are played out over and over again, but for the most part, there are some interesting thiings going on in the movie that I haven't seen that much of before,, I f you're looking for a comedy that will make you laugh all of the way thru the movie, then this is for you.

Racially and politically motivated script. Gets old fast.

The movie is basically your run of the mill Police comedies. Where the two main characters are inept but come good and get results ( except in this case they are security guards). It's light hearted and not a bad effort. What does let it down badly are the racist jokes about caucasians. The film probably would not have even been aired if the jokes were reversed and made about other races.

Hank (Steve Zahn) is a dedicated police officer while Earl (Martin Lawrence) is a security guard who longs to join the force. One day, Hank pulls Earl over for a minor infraction but things get out of hand quickly. Earl is full of lip and Hank has a breaking point. But, there's more. A bee starts buzzing nearby and Earl screams that he is highly allergic. As Hank tries to swat the bee, a citizen films the encounter, which looks like he is beating Earl. Plus, Earl does get stung. Sensing a financial opportunity, Earl allows his swollen face to be photographed, too. Thus, the situation looks like the second coming of Rodney King and Hanks is fired. Poor guy, he is also send to prison for six months AND loses his gal in the process. When he gets out, the only thing open to him is a security guard position. In this capacity, he runs into Earl, again, on the job, where a beautiful lady is distracting Earl's attentions and a crime is going on in the background. Hank tries his best and Earl jumps into the game. From then on, although they don't catch the bad guys the first time around, this unlikely duo teams up to take down the criminals. Along the way, they fight, they laugh, they get into sticky situations. Will they become unlikely heroes? Hey, there's nothing wrong with watching two very funny men, Zahn and Lawrence, do their thing, along with a nice supporting cast. Chuckles come forth again and again. In addition, there is some great action scenes and stunts that will also please the right crowd. All right, the script is not Oscar stuff but no one really cares. To secure an evening of laughs, get National Security soon!

"National Security" is the latest misguided vehicle for Martin Lawrence. It's a mystery to most viewers how can this talented comedian fall so low. Either the people behind him don't have any idea of what to put him in, or Mr. Lawrence doesn't have any sense of what turkey to do next. After "The Black Knight" we thought no one would employ him, but he keeps turning in these dopey attempts at comedy.One can't help to wonder how minority groups would react to this movie had the racial slurs been directed at them. The blame rests with the studio, the production company, the writers and the director. The film is an inane attempt at comedy that is not funny at all.Steve Zahn must have his head examined for agreeing to appear in this unadulterated piece of @#$%

The film features two guys who are security guards teaming up to stop something foul, so it is sort of different I guess; however, the John Candy and Eugene Levy security guard duo movie is superior. I do like Steve Zahn and he makes this film a lot better than it has any right to be; yet, from a lot of posters and such, you would think he is a secondary character at best to Martin Lawrence who is front and center of all the promotional stuff for this film. Seems a bit unfair, considering the movie does actually center on Zahn's character more than Lawrence, who is funny in this, don't get me wrong, he just seems to be the second guy in this film.The story in this one, Earl, played by Zahn and his partner are police and they end up in a very dangerous setting where Earl's partner is killed. Earl catches Lawrence's character after getting the boot from the police academy trying to reach in his car because he locked the keys in. Due to each other's situation at the moment, their meeting gets blown out of proportion and Earl ends up fired and imprisoned for beating Martin Lawrence, though in reality it was a bee sting that got Lawrence! Soon, Earl is out of prison and using any connection he can to try and find his partner's killer and soon he and Lawrence are reunited and find themselves in a plot involving some space aged metal!As I said, Steve Zahn carries the film with Lawrence adding a bit of humorous touches here and there. I think they went overboard in how they got Earl terminated from his job, but I was glad everything worked out a bit in the end. Martin at times can be a bit much, so I am glad the focus is on Zahn as you almost want to tell Martin to settle down a bit with the ranting.So, the film had its moments and was a bit funny. The action was pretty good in it too and probably overlooked as everyone is thinking this is strictly a comedy. One of those films my wife picked for movie night that was not too bad to watch; however, the film is not anything I would like to see again either unless it just happened to be on for some background noise. Wish Steve Zahn was in more stuff, because I always find him very funny as an actor; of course, these days you do not see much of him or Lawrence in films.

I like Martin Lawrence, I thought he was funny in "Martin", "Blue Streak" , and the Bad Boys films. In those films, however Lawrence plays a likable character. In National Security he plays a racist dolt. Lawrence is a security guard who tried and failed to be a LA cop. After a cop played by Steve Zahn mistakenly believes he is trying to steal a car, a bee flies by and Zahn tries to swat it away. It is misconstrued as an act of police brutality and Lawrence lies and gets Zahn thrown in jail.Throughout the movie Lawrence's character is racist, he is also a hypocrite believing that white men shouldn't be with black woman, but if the roles are reversed well, that's just fine. Lawrence's character's actions aren't simply racist against whites but against blacks as well, making whites look racist against blacks and blacks look like race-card playing jerks. If the roles were reversed and Zahn was making stupid quips about blacks this film would be assailed as racist, if it were released at all. Avoid.

It takes a lot to offend me. I'd like to think I've been fairly hardened through the nineteen years I've lived. I can laugh at politically incorrect stuff. I find South Park quite humorous and satirical, rather than offensive and disgusting. It takes a lot to offend me. But this movie did. Dennis Dugan, continuing on the stroll he began with Saving Silverman which contained the biggest, most concentrated amount of misogyny in a single area, brings us one of the most racist films of newer time. Only, it's not what you'd immediately think; it's not racist against black people. Nope, it's against white people instead. As if that makes it any better. Hate and fascism is bad, regardless of where it's directed, which group or person is targeted by and for it. As pointed out on the message boards for this film, every bad guy in this film is white, and Lawrence's character plays the race card every other second in this movie. Now, let me make it absolutely clear; I don't hate anyone. I don't believe in hate. I have equal respect for everyone. I would have been just as offended had this movie targeted black people instead of white(the film would also have been shot down far quicker and more broadly), or if Saving Silverman had been hateful towards men, for that matter. The plot is pitiful. There was a scene in a courthouse that downright sickened me. The crowd was cheering as a victim of false allegations was attacked verbally and sentenced to jail-time... as if they were watching a sports event. The acting is OK. The humor was offending; most of it is Lawrence victimizing himself and berating white people. Both Zahn and Lawrence have been funny... what happened? There's not much else. I barely watched this film, because whenever I looked at the screen and paid attention to what was said, I was hit with an offending remark or action and felt a strong inclination to turn away, to concentrate my attention elsewhere. One to avoid. I don't really recommend this film to anyone... except for perhaps black extremists. Even most black people will most likely find this movie embarrassing and painfully stupid. And Dugan: so much hate... so much anger... have you considered seeking professional help? It can't be healthy. 2/10

Recently re-watching this early 2000's Action Buddy Cop Comedy, i noticed how over the top racist it is against whites from the blacks point of view, now i normally would just ignore it but oh my is Martin Lawrence over the top annoying as he's constantly against his white partner Steve Zhan, at first it was kind of silly & funny but then it was constant & harsh so much so that it ruined some fun moments!!!I like Martin Lawrence in "Blue Streak" & "Bad Boys" but here he's way over the top & annoying like he was in "Big Mommas House" i used to like that film but now i find Lawrence too silly & too over the top to enjoy it.Now "National Security" is still a fairly enjoyable action comedy Cop film, but that's because Steve Zhan is great here as the straight-laced good Cop that is constantly having Bad luck & is accused & sent to prison for beating a "Black man" (Lawrence), it's here that it's really treading on very serious territory with lots of nods to the infamous "Rodney King" trial & scandal from the 90's!!!
Too much racism in a Comedy just isn't funny!!!
Apart from the over the top Racial crap "National Security" can be a fun throwback to those 80's & 90's Buddy Cop flicks & there's some very good action scenes & some funny moments & it's filmed well, the look is very 90's Cop movie cinematography.Steve Zahn, who was good in "Joy ride" & "Daddy Day Care" is very good here & gives a solid performance as a Cop who basically loses everything when he tries to arrest Martin Lawrence's character, Zahn definitely saves the whole movie!!!
Zahn, who gives the film a more grounded & dramatic center as he loses his partner at the beginning & is genuinely playing this movie straight & is the best on screen.
"National Security" is a solid entry in the Buddy Cop genre & is worth watching if you like Steve Zhan & Martin Lawrence is ok but can grate when he's constantly being racist.Martin Lawrence was much better in "Blue Streak"

The character played by Martin Lawrence looks like and acts like a total moron, but also a heavily racist moron, and a dangerous moron. Surely such ta person as he, whether black or white, would NEVER make it into a police force? 
I found this film extremely offensive and worlhless. It plays to the basest instincts, is not at all clever, apparently strives to hit every crude cliché around, while introducing hideous behaviour that will amuse only those with mindsets stuck at age 5 and IQs well below 70. 
The movie is a disaster, a shameful disaster, which should never have been made. A Spanish-language "song" is played a few minutes into the film: one of the Spanish words is "pendejo". (a very oscene word for penis) I was not surprised to hear this; it just about sums up the attitude and level of the producers of the flick. I hope that they will receive a little blast of enlightenment soon, and try to produce a movie that has some decent qualities while providing entertainment without resorting to filth and overt stupid racism ~ whether from blacks to white or from whites to blacks. Please!

After witnessing his partner being shot and killed, a police officer named "Hank Rafferty" (Steve Zahn) is then wrongfully accused of being too rough on a black citizen by the name of "Earl Montgomery" (Martin Lawrence). Because of this he is terminated and has to accept employment as a security guard. Then, as luck would have it, he finds himself teamed up with another security guard who just happens to be--Earl Montgomery. Needless to say, he is not happy with this at all. Even so, he is determined to apprehend those responsible for the murder of his partner and, as a result, he has no other choice other than to allow Earl to tag along. Now, rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that, while this clearly wasn't the funniest movie ever made, I thought it was enjoyable enough for the most part. That said, however, I should probably mention that some of the scenes had a certain racial component that some people might find offensive. Quite frankly, I believe that these off-color scenes were never intended to be taken seriously and it is what gives this comedy its flavor. In any case, I found this movie to be worth the time spent watching and I rate it as slightly above average.

A funny enough buddy cop movie. Not all the jokes land, but there are a few good laughs. The storyline is fairly basic, but still manages to hold interest. Go in with no expectations and it's pretty good.

If you like movies packed with racial jokes, you're in for a hit. Or should I point out that the racism comes from Lawrence and goes on and on into stereotyping 'tha black bro'...? I'm 100% confused by what Lawrence tries to accomplish with this movie, besides doing a ninety minute round up about what he apparently would like everybody to believe to be 'the way that black people should act'. If all the displayed racism would come from his white opponent in this movie, I think it would have started a riot. It should be forbidden for anybody to produce these kind of racist-movies. Shame on you Lawrence.

I usually don't like Martin Lawrence and I find his anti-white humor to be quite offensive as well as his string of bad movies.

I enjoyed this little comedy much more than I expected; my main reason for seeing it was Roberts. Anyway, the film works in an unpretentious way. It amused meme and the person that I was watching the comedy withas a film that found its tone and channel. It is very fastpaced, and quite likable. It's very physical, goodnatured and enjoyable; as a matter of fact, it is a humorous crime drama, a humorous cop film (about corrupt cops, etc.).There are some very noticeable beautiful girls ("Lola" and Zahn's exgirlfriend).Mari Morrow and Robinne Lee.Needless to say that my original reason for watching itRobertshas a role so small that they could use anybody else. But maybe Roberts was cheaper than anybody else?Some perceived this flick as ...racist.I see it as politically incorrect,in a cheap but funny way--which is good.

I'm always amazed when I look back at how underrated this movie is. 6/10 is understandable, but anything lower is just now fair.There are mountains of good comedy within the show, mostly prompted by Martin Lawrence's antics.I always look back at how many jokes people remember from a comedy and if it's more than 2, it usually means it was successful. They may have not been PC, they may not have been witty, but they got the job done.I've seen a lot more critically acclaimed movies that I struggle to remember at least one funny scene from.

I thought the movie started off very good with a serious tone of intrigue and suspense. That's what attracted me to watch it while channel surfing.Although it's the first film I've seen with Steve Zahn, I thought he was genuine in his portrayal of emotion over the death of his fellow officer. His loyalty and respect for his friend and partner showed in every aspect of his acting.Enter Martin Lawrence . . . then it became too silly.As for, Bill Duke and Eric Roberts, they're always great in my opinion. Seasoned and mature actors.I just can't take Martin Lawrence seriously. He's a funny comedian, but this type of silly slapstick takes away from the suspense of the film. The whole "bee" story, police academy farce, as well as the girl with the handcuffs, along with a few more so-called "funny" scenes, should have been re-written to better fit the plot. It's cute for situation comedy, but not for a movie that starts on such a serious tone. It's misleading and kills the suspense.The movie would have been much better without it.

Earl Montgomery is a cop wannabe who can't get past the academy into the force.  Hank Rafferty is a real cop who is emotionally on edge having seen the murder of his partner by a gang raiding a warehouse.  When the two get involved in a minor roadside traffic stop, Earl claims Hank beat him and gets him thrown off the force.  Hank takes up a job as a security guard and sets out to find the gang that killed his partner.  He finds them in a warehouse protected by Earl (also now a security guard) and the two reluctantly team up to go after the gang.  However when they steal the gang's merchandise they find themselves hunted by both the gang and the cops.Although I like to think of myself as having reasonably good taste  I do find Martin Lawrence funny.  I don't know why but many of his films just make me laugh even though I feel like I shouldn't !  However this film is the recent exception to that.  I saw the trailer and thought that it might be worth a stab  wrong!  The plot is a shambles of coincidence and plot holes  where there is a doubt they simply have a big gun fight.  There is no real tension to the plot as it is so very loose  even at the end you'll struggle to know much about the plot outside of the two central characters.The action scenes make the A-Team look realistic and tense  they are simply tonnes of bullets flying everywhere before the bad guys are dispatched with one shot!  This sucks any excitement or tension out of them and only leaves you with lots of noise that just feels pointless in the extreme.  In that way they reflect the wider plot I guess.  Sadly though, the poor action and poor plot is by no means the worst part of this film.Easily the worst part of this film is the fact that 99% of the `jokes' are based on race  in particular Martin Lawrence's comments which are either a) laments on the victimisation of his race or b) reverse-racism remarks that border on the offensive and would certainly never be allowed to pass if the lines had been given to his white co-star.  The victimisation things are simply not funny and merely make the lead look like he has an enormous chip on his shoulder about his colour  maybe 2 or 3 remarks along these lines would have worked but to have nearly every line based on this is simply overkill and it quickly gets tiresome.  Other remarks I simply found offensive  I'm sorry, I know this is meant to be a comedy but I found them bigoted in the extreme.  What makes it worse is the fact that the film plays Earl as a hero and never shows him to change his way or his opinion  hence it validates what he says.  For example to have a character state that he is against interracial relationships between white men and black women (and never take it back) is simply offensive  as I (a white man) sat with my wife of Nigerian-descent I felt very uncomfortable that anyone would allow such insulting dialogue to be part of a film.  Even if you think I am making a big deal out of nothing  just imagine this whole film if even half of Earl's dialogue had been said by Hank  there would simply have been an outcry!To make the offensive material worse  it is rarely funny.  I don't know what Lawrence is up to.  This summer he has the chance to kick start his big league career again in Bad Boys 2 where he'll get help from Smith and Union  but this is a huge leap back  pandering to an audience that may find it funny because they too have a chip on their shoulder about race.  I usually find his mugging and saying `yo ass' or `and sh*t' after every sentence funny but here the chip on his character should simply obliterates everything else.  Zahn is poor  I have not seen him in a strong role but this must be a step backwards even by his standards  he suffers at the hands of racist remarks and comes off badly  even his relationship with Denise is played for laughs as the writers expected the audience to find it a joke that Hank could land with a `fine sista' like that, it even goes so far as to have Denise admire Earl's penis!!  In fairness Robinne Lee (Denise) is gorgeous and it is good to see her in something again after only seeing her in Hav Plenty. God knows why Eric Roberts is in it  he has nothing to do and his wig just looked stupid, likewise Bill Duke is only there for the dirty looks.Overall I enjoy Lawrence comedies even though many are silly.  Here the jokes are nearly all based on race or reverse-racism and after the first 3 time they get increasingly unfunny and tired.  At best this film is lame and barely amusing, at worst it is simply bigoted (regardless of what colour the character is  bigotry is bigotry) and will be offensive to anyone who tries to get past the issues of race and racism in their daily lives.

Martin Lawrence was absolutely funny in this movie,, he had so many great one liners I couldn't stop laughing the entire movie,, yeah the buddy cop genre has pretty much worn out it's welcome in the last 20 years. but this one is refreshing.

Racially and politically motivated script. Gets old fast.

Sure many people that didn't like this are vocal about it, but for me I like Steve Zahn and Lawrence proved himself in Blue Streak. I like the wit of director Dennis Dugan, ever since I saw him in "can't Buy Me Love" back in 1987. I haven't forgotten the personality he has. Although he didn't direct that one, but he has done plenty of other great pictures's. So with that I will explain, as the screw-ups that these two partners are, they try to be cool and make it happened while being inattentive boobs, they get demoted, and dropped done to a sub-level in their careers, the place that they don't want to be, so now they're a little scared about being trapped in one place. Plus there is a bigger event that is pushing them to act in a more serious and calculated manner. These two have to get to some seriousness...amongst all the craziness. Zahn, has a really good flavor for this part and he does have a talented ability that he brings to many other roles, I like his style. If he bulked up, which might not be too healthy, but never the less he might be another Chris Farley!! Martin Lawrence is just great at bringing the crazy-civilized guy to the part. He seems to have that go back and forth ability that allows him to be either way and seemingly always a little of both. I enjoyed this even if others complained about it. For me I can recommend it to others, mostly I will say, get this on an edited film purchasing site, so that you don't have to worry about the kids, if you have any, seeing and hearing stuff that ain't appropriate. I liked the soundtrack as well, for an urban sort of feeling. I would still get the edited version for me anyway.At any rate I recommend, although nutty and a little corny, it's still up there on the fun scale. (**)

I remember being 10 when the trailer came out and was so excited to see it, I've seen at least 70 or more times since. Denis Dugan made such a fun comedy with amazing characters/ scenes! I love the way Martin Lawerence acts throughout Steve Zahn is great too they have great banter together! Also the only bad thing is the racial madness but I don't mind makes the story better.

Only, it's not what you'd immediately think; it's not racist against black people. Nope, it's against white people instead. As if that makes it any better. Hate and fascism is bad, regardless of where it's directed, which group or person is targeted by and for it. As pointed out on the message boards for this film, every bad guy in this film is white, and Lawrence's character plays the race card every other second in this movie. Now, let me make it absolutely clear; I don't hate anyone. I don't believe in hate. I have equal respect for everyone. I would have been just as offended had this movie targeted black people instead of white(the film would also have been shot down far quicker and more broadly), or if Saving Silverman had been hateful towards men, for that matter. The plot is pitiful. There was a scene in a courthouse that downright sickened me. The crowd was cheering as a victim of false allegations was attacked verbally and sentenced to jail-time... as if they were watching a sports event. The acting is OK. The humor was offending; most of it is Lawrence victimizing himself and berating white people. Both Zahn and Lawrence have been funny... what happened? There's not much else. I barely watched this film, because whenever I looked at the screen and paid attention to what was said, I was hit with an offending remark or action and felt a strong inclination to turn away, to concentrate my attention elsewhere. One to avoid. I don't really recommend this film to anyone... except for perhaps black extremists. Even most black people will most likely find this movie embarrassing and painfully stupid. And Dugan: so much hate... so much anger... have you considered seeking professional help? It can't be healthy. 2/10

This movie could have worked if Martin Lawrence wasn't so goofy and over the top.  He was just flat out annoying in this movie.  Maybe the writing was so poor that this is the only way for him to play the character, or maybe he had too much artistic license and the director was too sheepish to keep him in line.  Whatever the case, the movie isn't a total loss, but you know you have a bomb on your hands when your two year old likes this seemingly adult-oriented movie more than his father did.

Recently re-watching this early 2000's Action Buddy Cop Comedy, i noticed how over the top racist it is against whites from the blacks point of view, now i normally would just ignore it but oh my is Martin Lawrence over the top annoying as he's constantly against his white partner Steve Zhan, at first it was kind of silly & funny but then it was constant & harsh so much so that it ruined some fun moments!!!I like Martin Lawrence in "Blue Streak" & "Bad Boys" but here he's way over the top & annoying like he was in "Big Mommas House" i used to like that film but now i find Lawrence too silly & too over the top to enjoy it.Now "National Security" is still a fairly enjoyable action comedy Cop film, but that's because Steve Zhan is great here as the straight-laced good Cop that is constantly having Bad luck & is accused & sent to prison for beating a "Black man" (Lawrence), it's here that it's really treading on very serious territory with lots of nods to the infamous "Rodney King" trial & scandal from the 90's!!!
Too much racism in a Comedy just isn't funny!!!
Apart from the over the top Racial crap "National Security" can be a fun throwback to those 80's & 90's Buddy Cop flicks & there's some very good action scenes & some funny moments & it's filmed well, the look is very 90's Cop movie cinematography.Steve Zahn, who was good in "Joy ride" & "Daddy Day Care" is very good here & gives a solid performance as a Cop who basically loses everything when he tries to arrest Martin Lawrence's character, Zahn definitely saves the whole movie!!!
Zahn, who gives the film a more grounded & dramatic center as he loses his partner at the beginning & is genuinely playing this movie straight & is the best on screen.
"National Security" is a solid entry in the Buddy Cop genre & is worth watching if you like Steve Zhan & Martin Lawrence is ok but can grate when he's constantly being racist.Martin Lawrence was much better in "Blue Streak"

The character played by Martin Lawrence looks like and acts like a total moron, but also a heavily racist moron, and a dangerous moron. Surely such ta person as he, whether black or white, would NEVER make it into a police force? 
I found this film extremely offensive and worlhless. It plays to the basest instincts, is not at all clever, apparently strives to hit every crude cliché around, while introducing hideous behaviour that will amuse only those with mindsets stuck at age 5 and IQs well below 70. 
The movie is a disaster, a shameful disaster, which should never have been made. A Spanish-language "song" is played a few minutes into the film: one of the Spanish words is "pendejo". (a very oscene word for penis) I was not surprised to hear this; it just about sums up the attitude and level of the producers of the flick. I hope that they will receive a little blast of enlightenment soon, and try to produce a movie that has some decent qualities while providing entertainment without resorting to filth and overt stupid racism ~ whether from blacks to white or from whites to blacks. Please!

A funny enough buddy cop movie. Not all the jokes land, but there are a few good laughs. The storyline is fairly basic, but still manages to hold interest. Go in with no expectations and it's pretty good.

All Martin Lawerence does is complain about white people in the film. Just giving them the back hand. I was honestly offended. We had to watch this in our communications class. Seeing how stereotypes are. The teacher said "And we laugh at what some consider offensive". Duh! I mean I've heard the white jokes before, don't get me wrong. Sometimes they're funny. Like Chris Tucker. He has fun with it. But he doesn't' go overboard with it. Martin Lawerence does on the other hand. The movie is OK. But I wouldn't watch it again. It is a total rip off of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and Rush Hour. Stay away if you loved those films.2/10

After witnessing his partner being shot and killed, a police officer named "Hank Rafferty" (Steve Zahn) is then wrongfully accused of being too rough on a black citizen by the name of "Earl Montgomery" (Martin Lawrence). Because of this he is terminated and has to accept employment as a security guard. Then, as luck would have it, he finds himself teamed up with another security guard who just happens to be--Earl Montgomery. Needless to say, he is not happy with this at all. Even so, he is determined to apprehend those responsible for the murder of his partner and, as a result, he has no other choice other than to allow Earl to tag along. Now, rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that, while this clearly wasn't the funniest movie ever made, I thought it was enjoyable enough for the most part. That said, however, I should probably mention that some of the scenes had a certain racial component that some people might find offensive. Quite frankly, I believe that these off-color scenes were never intended to be taken seriously and it is what gives this comedy its flavor. In any case, I found this movie to be worth the time spent watching and I rate it as slightly above average.

National Security is a terrible comedy and one of the worst movies of the year. Earl and Hank have only one thing in common: they're both L.A.P.D. rejects. Hank just got kicked out, and Earl can't even get accepted in. After confronting each other on opposite sides of the law during a traffic stop that escalates way out of control, these two luckless individuals end up in partnership as security guards. Despite being damned to the lowest line of the law enforcement, Earl and Hank uncover a smuggling operation led by Nash and a his thugs. The plot sounds alright and it does have potential to be funny. Funny it wasn't though as this is one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. The reason this film is so bad is because of Martin Lawrence. Besides for a few films, Martin Lawrence has a terrible film record. He continues to get cast since some people find him funny. While he may deliver a funny line here or there, he usually goes over the top. His racism is so annoying and getting tired and he pretty much kills this film from succeeding. Steve Zahn plays his Hank and his talents are wasted. Dennis Dugan directs and he has made some pretty good films in the past including Big Daddy and Happy Gilmore. He does a terrible job this time around and hopefully he can rebound with his next film. National Security is such a poorly written comedy and it seemed like the writers weren't trying at all to be funny. The movie has nothing new to offer just the same tried gags as usual. The story turns out to be pretty dumb as well and not funny. The films running time is a brief 88 minutes. Even though, it drags at a lot of scenes and seems a lot longer. In the end, this film is defiantly worth skipping as well as most of Martin Lawrence's movies. Rating 3/10 avoid this "comedy" at all costs.

The movie's plot line is pretty funny and the action and comedy are good - not laugh out loud good but more like humorous :) I do think that you can watch it more than once. Steve Zahn and martin Lawrence do portray a good but unstable team in the film but thats all part of the humour. Personally I love most action comedies due to the fact that they are uplifting... Honestly though, this is a great comedy and the acting does seem cheap but in a way it does fit in with the whole comedy genre so there are'nt any major problems. Anyway, thanks for reading my review and if you watch the movie.. enjoy it and grab a bowl of popcorn!

National Security is directed by American comedy regular Dennis Dugan, and this was before he directed some truly @#%#ing crap movies ("I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry" and "The Benchwarmers" were two latter comedies he should undoubtedly regret making.) The result is his funniest film I've seen, and Martin Lawrence always makes me laugh anyway.The story begins with a cop, Hank (played by Steve Zahn, from Sahara) who is sent to jail for half a year, rid of his job and girlfriend while still under stress from the death of his partner because of Earl (Martin Lawrence from Big Momma's House)'s annoying attitude leading to a confusion of Hank beating Earl with a baton. Half a year later their paths cross again as security guards, and both must work together to bring down the people who killed Hank's former partner. What follows is shootouts, explosions and rapid fire gags as the two try not to kill each other. Of course, you could never call National Security a great film, but it's not trying to be. What the film is attempting to do is deliver hilarious gags and a good time. And it succeeds in both areas.It's a fun film to watch, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh. As the trailer foretells, it's a buddy comedy, without the buddies.Also look out for Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight) with blond hair, a strange sight to see!7/10

If you like movies packed with racial jokes, you're in for a hit. Or should I point out that the racism comes from Lawrence and goes on and on into stereotyping 'tha black bro'...? I'm 100% confused by what Lawrence tries to accomplish with this movie, besides doing a ninety minute round up about what he apparently would like everybody to believe to be 'the way that black people should act'. If all the displayed racism would come from his white opponent in this movie, I think it would have started a riot. It should be forbidden for anybody to produce these kind of racist-movies. Shame on you Lawrence.
