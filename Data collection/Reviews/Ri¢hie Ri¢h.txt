I didn't absolutely hate Richie Rich, but for me it wasn't that great either. As usual, there were some good things, but some not so good things as well.THE GOOD THINGS: 1) Macaulay Culkin, personally I think he is better an actor than people give him credit for. He is one of the main reasons why I love the first two Home Alone movies so much. Here, he gives a very spirited lead performance, admittedly not as cute as he was when he was starring in underrated gems like Uncle Buck, but he shows once again what a talented actor he was.2) Jonathan Hyde as the butler comes very close to stealing the show, a very funny and sly performance. Also Edward Hermann and Christine Ebersole give humorous performances, while John Larroquette plays the villain of the piece more than adequately.3) The scenery is quite impressive, captured well by the breezy cinematography. The Biltmore estate was gorgeous.4) The soundtrack was decent, nice background music especially.5) I liked the moral the film taught; All the money in the world can't make you happy, thinking about it that is true.THE NOT SO GOOD THINGS: 1) While I liked the moral of the film, the story itself is predictable and somewhat contrived. it probably doesn't help you have seen it all before.2) The script is quite weak in general. Don't get me wrong there were some good spots like "Oh my god I look like Michael Jackson!" but the jokes are admittedly very silly and juvenile, and the scripting does fall in the danger of becoming clichéd.3) The pacing. Now I don't mind films that move fast. I do have more of a problem if the pacing is TOO fast, despite the feel good nature of the film, and its valiant attempt to rise above superficial material, the film feels a little too rushed, the ending particularly felt skimmed over.4) The characters feel rather stereotypical. Maybe that is an unfair complaint as it probably couldn't be avoided, but I couldn't help thinking yeah I recognise that type of character.Overall, definitely not a bad film, worth watching at least once, but I personally didn't find it that great. 5/10 Bethany Cox

This was Macaulay Culkin's first major flop, when he was finally un-cute enough that viewers noticed he couldn't act. Other than that, compared with other mindless, shallow, hopelessly far-fetched pseudo-adventures designed for either very small or very uncritical children, it's really not worse than one would expect. Well, the comic book on which it's based is not exactly Stan Lee either From a pedagogical point of view, one must say that Richie takes control of his situation in the absence of his parents, makes decisions that are largely sensible and practical, and carries them out mostly without adult help. He combines emotional and rational qualities without violating his basic identity as a kid. To me, that's all good, and redeems the entertainment value of this movie for a young audience.

This movie - Macaulay Culkin's Last movie as a child is not his best but not his worst - that goes to the unfunny Ted Danson Action 'comedy' Getting even with dad which came out the same year-      But it's pretty sickly sweet and you can see why it bombed at the Box Office. The plot concerns the richest boy in the world 'Richie Rich' Played by Culkin, But by this time he was at 14 looking too old to play the title role. He's the boy who has everything, wealthy parents lives in a big mansion has a butler (wonderfully played by Johnathan Hyde) - But he's very lonely, he has no friends. So one day he tries to join a group of inner city kids playing baseball but they don't want to know him. one of Richie's father's associates Lawrence van dough (John Larroquette) wants to get his hands on the company and the family's fortune, so he tries to kill mum and dad -Ritchie needs the other kids's help to save the company, his parents and his fortune aided by The butler.Not a bad movie it has a very good moral story (all the money in the world can't make you happy)- But strictlty for KIDS or easily amused adultsRating 7/10

Directed by Donald Petrie, 1994's 'Richie Rich' tells the story of a very rich young boy, named Richie Rich (Macaulay Culkin) whom finds out that his family is being targeted by a very extreme corporate takeover by Richie's father's business partner, greedy Laurence Van Dough (John Larroquette), who seeks to gain control of their empire, plunder their famed family vault and inherit their vast treasures. Left only, with his cunning and youth, and some help from his loyal butler/companion, Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde), Richie must try to find a way to stop Van Dough, in order to save his parents, Richard (Edward Herrmann) & Regina (Christine Ebersole)'s fortune. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this film is probably best known, today, as Culkin's final film as a child actor. It's sad to see Culkin immediately withdrawn himself from the big screen after this movie, but I can understand, why. First off, the movie bombed at the box office. Somewhat killing what was left of source material of the same name; by 1994, Harvey Comics was no more. Because of that, no studio wanted, Culkin as the main lead, anymore. Another was, puberty hitting Culkin really hard. The cracking of his voice, throughout this film, really shows that. Another problem, was the backstage conflict with his personal's family life. He just started, to sue his parents to remove them as legal guardians in control of his $17 million fortune. So, it really did strain, the actor during production. It really shows in his performance, as he somehow, made the charismatic, cocky, yet eccentric, Richie Rich from the comic book, into a dull, lonely, depressing and gloomy person. I get that, half of that problem, was, due to the awful writing, but it seem like, he was phoning it, in, at times. I would rather have the charming over the top, billionaire of the comics, over this watered down version, any day. At least, that version, he has friends. It's just so weird, to see, Richie Rich, without friends, here. It's not like, he's over-protective, too greedy, fearful, or condescending to others. So, what the hell!? It seems so out of place, that he would be that lonely. I get the fact that some rich people, might get really get lonely at the top, but you would think, he would had some friends on his own, or at least, some people that would act like, they were his friends. After all, some people always love to surround themselves with people with money. So, it doesn't make much sense. It's also funny, that the film has this, "Money can't buy friendship" sub-plot message, with Richie. However, that subplot quickly backfires, as one of the adults, bribed some local kids to become friends with Richie. I guess, money can indeed buy you, happiness. Anyways, most of Richie's so-call friends, were kinda boring. They were so generic and one-dimensional stereotypes. First off, you got the girl/love interest, Gloria Pazinski, (Stephi Lineburg) who is somewhat based off, Gloria Glad from the comics. Then, there is the token, black guy, Omar (Joel Robinson) who does nothing, but speak in slang and talk about the projects. Then, you got the wise-guy, Italian kid, Tony (Michael Maccarone) and the fat Hawaiian kid, Pee Wee (Jonathan Hilario). None of them, really seem, like they would, honestly hang out together, in any sort. Honestly, if you think, deep about it, most of these kids, doesn't seem to like Richie, besides his riches. It never really stated out, what makes them, want to continue to help, Richie, besides that. The only character that I found to honestly care about Richie, besides his parents was Cadbury. Cadbury's appearance here was so different from the comics and the 1980's Hanna-Barbera's cartoon version. In that version, a character of Irona the Robot Maid was given, more of a parent-like role, while, Cadbury serve, more like a background character. While, her presence in this film, would had help the story, greatly, due to the fact, it shows, how lonely, Richie is, when he has robot butlers, to take care of him than people. I get why, she was replaced by Hyde's character, story wise. Cadbury is the one that drives the story, forward, following the 'so-called' deaths of Richie's parents. Plus, Hyde does a wonderful job. Who knew, he has a comedy side? It's so cool to see him, here; not being typecast, as the evil, posh British guy, like he normally plays. Another factor is the fact, that the film is already, unrealistic enough with a kid being able to run a company and a Bond's Q, like inventor, Professor Keenbean (Mike McShane). Adding a walking talking robot to that mix, would be already too distracting. I'm already, having trouble, playing attention to the story, with all the celebrity cameos and produce placement, this movie has. Adding, one more badly done 1990's CGI robot would be, too much. The CGI in this film, is already badly dated. Despite that, the movie still has good action. The 1959's "North by Northwest" style climatic ending mixed with the 1990's 'Home Alone' antics was fun to watch. Also, the movie does have some funny moments. Mostly with Richie's parents. Even, John Larroquette was somewhat fun to watch, as the villain. I just wish the movie, stay true to the comics, and allow Van Dough to be Richie's uncle. It would had more stakes to the story. Also, the music by composter, Alan Silvestri was pretty awesome! I also, like the fact, most of the film was filmed entirely on location at the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. In the end, overall: I kinda enjoyed this film, despite the over glamorous lifestyle of the 1%ers. It's not the best Richie Rich adaptation, out there, however, its beats the Christmas themed direct to video sequel, 1998's 'Richie Rich's Christmas Wish', and the 2015's TV Series of the same name, any day. So check it out, if you want to.

I gave this movie a 7 on a scale of 1-10 because I took into consideration it is a kids movie and should be judged as such. When this movie came out I was 13 and of course I enjoyed it much more then as opposed to now but having watched it as a child and as an adult I do remember how much I enjoyed the film as a kid. From the harsh grade of a 4.4 average I assume people where comparing this to complex movies with great plots. Kids should not be subjected to nothing but adult theme. So when you grade the movie remember what audience it was desighned for.As a child I would have gave this movie a 7. Would you drive a metro and act as if it should perform like a porsche?

I think there are many movies made like this, probably aimed at some idea what children would like, but which will educate them as well. Money is indeed not everything, but baseball isn'teither. Most of the characters are too stereotyped to be funny. Too many movies of this kind have been made already, and I had at least hoped for some unique aspects. However, if this is the first of this kind you will see, you could be in for a great time.

Based on the comic strip of Richie Rich, this is an underrated film starring McCauley Culkin in a non Home Alone film. The co-star cast is not so bad either with John Larroquette (Dan from Night Court), Edward Hermann (voice of the History Channel) and Jonathan Hyde (Van Pelt from Jumanji). Christine Ebersole as Mrs. Rich though, was a letdown.For an early 90s family film, it can seem flunky by standards of 2018, but it was all in fun. What kid wouldn't want to live the life of Richie Rich, or have their very own McDonald's restaurant right inside their home?Definitely a fun film to show kids, especially if you were a fan of the film growing up. Of course, the story wasn't the best, but what do you expect. However, it's still entertaining in its own right. The sequel, a Christmas foray, is another story!

Too much given to the gee-whiz, what-can-Richie-afford, this movie needed to be much more crazy and whimsical, to fly in the face of the opulence onscreen. Good supporting cast mostly wasted.The sole unexpected moment of delight was finding out our villain would stop at nothing to capture the "Rich family treasures", consisting of bronzed baby shoes, portraits, and favored toys & mementos.Trip up our expectations once every few minutes, and let's talk.By the way, how many other movie posters give away the ending?

This is definitely teen fare, but it's very entertaining which means adults would get a lot of laughs out of it. As with any comedy, some of the stuff is really stupid and some of it is really funny. Along the way, you get some of modern Hollywood's secular plugs and a few swear words that you wouldn't want your little ones to hear, but overall, I have little to criticize with this one.There were a number of sight gags, things that made me laugh out loud, such as dollar signs instead of spots on the dog, the dress-ware of the little rich kid (Macauley Culkin), the eccentric characters - good and bad guys - are all fun to watch.I thought Jonathan Hyde, as the butler, stole the show.

I don't know why it has such a low rating. The movie does not want to be taken serious. So it is not serious. The movie is aimed at kids and that makes it great. I watched it in my early twenties and had a good evening watching the movie. Great for family's and kids.

Yes, I am not a member of his fan club and for the most part I hate nearly everything he was in. My favorite scene with him is the one in "The Good Son" involving the cliff. I had a nice laugh with that one. Here there is no such scene and the film might as well be called "Home Alone 3: this time the kids rich!" as it has almost the same premise. Granted the parents did not really leave him, but rather got into an airplane crash, but it is essentially the same as that brat is in this one too. So the story is the kid is lonely and tries to make friends, parents disappear after a plane crash, some dude is trying to get all the money for himself and there is no robot like there was in the original cartoon still trying to debate if that is a bad or good thing. All I know is that the film for the most part is cringe worthy, but as I have said I can not stand Macualay at all so I am going to tend to be against anything he is in. I did not like "Uncle Buck", "Home Alone" or any of the movies he has been in. Except for said scene, ah yes plunge to your death you spoiled sack of...ahem, the only reason I give this movie a two is that there was a joke in it that actually got me to laughing involving this laser or something blowing a chunk out of a stone statue. Other than that, barf.

I know, "Richie Rich" is supposed to be more about making friends than about wealth, but it doesn't work. The whole thing about the cabal trying to seize his money was merely an excuse for what was basically a glorification of money. I think that there's a reason that Macaulay Culkin disappeared after this movie (although that was already coming). There are some clever lines - namely the Michael Jackson comment - but there are plenty of good movies out there, so there's NO REASON to waste your time on this. Also starring John Larroquette, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole and Jonathan Hyde; they probably don't wish to include this on their resumes.

You know what, there was a lot to like in this movie. Generally, cartoons don't translate well to live action movies, but I'd say that this one wasn't too bad. Earlier in 1994 "The Flintstones" was a major flop, but that's because they diverged from the source material. "Richie Rich" stayed true to its cartoon roots.Some of the aspects of it were inane, but I liked that Richie Rich desired friendship more than money and his money never made him an unbearable brat. I also liked that his parents were grounded and not morally ruined by their money. Finally, I appreciated that the working class kids readily accepted Richie as a friend without having ulterior motives.I think it's easy to be critical of "Richie Rich," but I found it refreshing not to have the same old stereotypical characters. So, if it gets any bonus points, it gets bonus points for not using the same old tropes.

While 1994 was a great year to be Green Day or The Offspring, this was not so for the young Macaulay Culkin and his fans. As a 14 year old playing the younger 12 year "richest kid in the world", Culkin and his management must have realized quickly that he could not stay a child actor forever. Richie Rich, therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23-year-old young adult in 2003's Party Monster.In "Rich", no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between, especially for a family comedy. The post-Jurassic Park CGI "robot bee" may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault, anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside; that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep.Had the film starred another adolescent lead, we may have been forgiving, but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck, the Home Alone pictures, My Girl, and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute "Black or White" rampage. Being that it was filmed in and around the Chicagoland area, and that this reviewer is a sucker for anything local, this reviewer feels generous giving Richie Rich 4 out of 10 IMDb stars.

From director Donald Petrie (Mystic Pizza, Miss Congeniality), this is a film that probably got many kids saving their pocket money, I certainly wished I was rich. Basically Richie Rich (Razzie nominated Macaulay Culkin) is the richest kid in the world with unlimited wealth and everything he could ever want. There is one thing thing he doesn't have that he longs for, a normal life with some friends, but one day he sees some kids playing baseball and wants to join them, but they don't want him around. Richie manages to get them to like him however when he invites them to enjoy themselves to his mansion and all its luxuries, including a roller-coaster and a McDonald's restaurant. Meanwhile, Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette), the Rich family's executive is planning to kill the family and steal their fortune, so when Richie realises, he with his new friends and trusted English butler Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) plan to stop him. Also starring Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich, Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich, Michael McShane as Professor Keenbean, Chelcie Ross as Ferguson, Mariangela Pino as Diane Pazinski, Stephi Lineburg as Gloria Pazinski, Michael Maccarone as Tony and Claudia Schiffer as Aerobics Instructor. It has its moments of slapstick for the kids, but it is nowhere as entertaining as Home Alone, especially with Culkin reaching the age of 14 and nearly an adolescent. Okay!

Great movie, edited well and entertaining. Jonathan Hyde's acting is fantastic.

I love Culkin. He was great and this film is unfortunately not one of his best. But it still had some laughs here and there. But the Home Alone's are the must see over anything if you're going to watch Culkin.

Sometimes, when I come home tired from work and have a brewski and want to zone out, I feel like a total fluff movie. Richi Rich fills the bill. It moves along, something most movies don't. It's harmless and doesn't require any involvement on my part. The jokes are silly. I can miss some of it on a fridge run, come back to it, and still follow it. In fact, if I don't finish the movie, it doesn't seem to matter. However, it is charming, so I usually do.The movie pokes fun at the super rich on a superficial level, but that's all right. I'll save the harshly critical movies for a different mood. There's some lovely views of the Biltmore estate. There's light ribbing of the corporate world. Oh dear, I'm falling asleep. I'll miss the end of the movie. Too many brewskies.

I didn't absolutely hate Richie Rich, but for me it wasn't that great either. As usual, there were some good things, but some not so good things as well.THE GOOD THINGS: 1) Macaulay Culkin, personally I think he is better an actor than people give him credit for.

In 1994, Macaulay Culkin stared in 3 films: 'Richie Rich', 'The Pagemaster' and 'Getting even with dad', none of them particularly interesting. The movies themselves did poorly at cinemas and in critical terms.In 1994, Macaulay Culkin was 13/14 years old. He was in his early adolescence, so he was growing. A difficult phase for him. Ridiculously, people began to ignore him because of that - either that or they simply thought his cuteness was disappearing and gave him little value for that. But he always proved to be a terrific actor. True, there were many, many great child actors but he was one of them for sure. Sure, his cuteness took him far, but it was his talent that made him a legend.After playing a completely different role in the 1993 film 'The Good Son' (where he played a psychopath that could very well disguise that nature thanks to his angelical looks, a wolf in sheep's clothe), he returned to the roles of 'good guys' in all of his 1994 films.'Richie Rich' is not much of a film, but perhaps it's a little more interesting than 'The Pagemaster'. It's not a bad movie, but it's a somewhat complex film for me to give a fair rating. It has good moments but also very stupid moments, particularly from the 2nd half on (in my opinion, where the movie is at its weakest).Macaulay Culkin plays the title character. Richie Rich is rich (like his name suggests), lives in a fancy mansion surrounded by comfort and luxury and can even count with a chauffeur that takes him in his majestic and elegant Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud whenever it's necessary. But Richie realizes that there is one thing that money can't buy: happiness. He feels the lack of friends and possibly bored with his tedious life. He just wants to be like the other kids.About the things I found funny in this film, a good example of that is the line «Oh my God, I look like Michael Jackson!» by Richie's mother. Come to think of it... that's not untrue - lol. I'm surprised they put this line in the film because Macaulay Culkin stars in it and considering the friendship he had with the eccentric singer... Other funny details are, for example, the cute dog that has dollar signs instead of spots and appropriately named Dollar, and the scene when Richie doesn't wanna wake up but stares at his personal trainer when he realizes what a beauty she is (she is portrayed by the supermodel Claudia Schiffer).Macaulay Culkin had everything to be a great name of the cinema. And he was, for a few years, mostly thanks to the success of the first two 'Home Alone' films. He was talented, charismatic and good-looking. Too bad he trashed his life later, but I believe he turned out to be like this because of his personal problems.

Richie Rich stars the charismatic, easily-lovable Macaulay Culkin in a role that basically begged for him from the first day of pre-production. Unfortunately, nothing else begged much attention in terms of how Richie Rich conducts itself as a piece of family entertainment. Is it serviceable? Absolutely. Just prepare for a rather long and tedious ninety-four minutes. Kids will appreciate it, seeing their favorite hero from Home Alone getting into more hairy little circumstances, but the true victims, the parents, will likely be contemplating better things they could be doing with their time.Make no mistake; I was enjoying Richie Rich for about forty-five minutes on a simply, passable level. Then at the hour mark, I grew restless, and by the finale, I was shaking my head at the missed opportunity the film could've capitalized on. I'll come back to this later. The story is inspired from the comic-book character who made quite the name for himself in books and strips that I never found myself reading. He is played by Macaulay Culkin, who was born to Richard and Regina Rich (Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole), a couple worth a dollar over $70 billion thanks to their immensely successful Rich Industries. The three live in a house that appears to be sitting two full-size golf courses, and embrace their wealthy status in the way of philanthropy, and not personal narcissism.While Richie enjoys living a lavish life, traveling in helicopters, playing basketball in doors, and carrying thousand-dollar bills in his wallet, he greatly envies the lives of regular, middle-class children, who have very little priorities and can spend their days playing baseball in an open sandlot.With this kind of setup, you'd think the film would be on the track of setting up a "lonely rich boy" sort of moral, emphasizing that all the money in the world can't buy true, wholesome companionship, right? Well, just as we're about to further dive into that, a pesky plot point involving corruption, attempted-murder, and industry takeover begins to plague the Rich family, and with rumor that his parents are dead after a nice pack of TNT was on their private plane, Richie assumes the role as the CEO of the company. But just as we're about to go further into that detail, we focus on one of Richard Rich's employees, who tried to murder the couple and their kid to take over Rich Industries for himself. Not if Richie and his loyal butler Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) can help it, though.Right off the bat, we just passed up two solid directions this film could've taken instead of the contrived, foreseeable one it settled on. Yet if there's one thing that can't be overlooked about this film, it's the abundance of character-actors, who all do a capable job of doing what they can with what they have - especially Macaulay Culkin. Culkin's gifted, easy-going performance makes one sad that this was his last "big" film as a child actor, before landing roles in several under-performing independent films before fading into tabloid obscurity.Co-writer of Richie Rich Neil Tolkin worked on License to Drive, a potent, lively comedy about a teen and his two friends going out after hours in his grandfather's Cadillac even after failing his driver's test. After that, he settled for very little doing both Richie Rich and the atrocious Pauly Shore comedy Jury Duty a year later. When glancing through director Donald Petrie's filmography, it appears that he has made a career out of making spur-of-the-moment comedies that usually do fairly well at the box office before becoming safe-bets on cable. He has a formula and he should stick to it. It's just sort of upsetting that Richie Rich aspires to be functional, rather than successful.Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole, Jonathan Hyde, and John Larroquette. Directed by: Donald Petrie.

This is definitely teen fare, but it's very entertaining which means adults would get a lot of laughs out of it. As with any comedy, some of the stuff is really stupid and some of it is really funny. Along the way, you get some of modern Hollywood's secular plugs and a few swear words that you wouldn't want your little ones to hear, but overall, I have little to criticize with this one.There were a number of sight gags, things that made me laugh out loud, such as dollar signs instead of spots on the dog, the dress-ware of the little rich kid (Macauley Culkin), the eccentric characters - good and bad guys - are all fun to watch.I thought Jonathan Hyde, as the butler, stole the show.

I don't know why it has such a low rating. The movie does not want to be taken serious. So it is not serious. The movie is aimed at kids and that makes it great. I watched it in my early twenties and had a good evening watching the movie. Great for family's and kids.

Richie Rich (Macaulay Culkin) is the most valuable possession of his billionaire parents (Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole). He has everything and loyal butler Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde). However he doesn't have regular friends of his own age. Professor Keenbean is the company scientist with his many inventions. Company executive Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette) opposes Mr. Rich's plan to give away a tool plant and spending on inventions. He also lust for whatever is hidden in the family vault. Richie makes friends with kids playing baseball at an industrial lot. Richie's parents are lost at sea when their plane is brought down by a bomb. Van Dough battles Richie who owns 51% share of the company.Richie Rich is a bad comic to make into a movie. I don't know what kind of problems Richie Rich has to overcome. It seems like a comic about a kid and his toys. The movie isn't cartoon fun. It does actually has some limited thrills. The characters are good for the most part. The mix of children's comic and real action don't always coexist easily. It's not that terrible but it doesn't really feel joyous.

Macaulay Culkins's sweet, childish cuteness is at it's climax here, cause he was 14 when it was was released, so he was 13 1/2 when they were filming it. He seemed about as close to growing from boy to man as you can get, while still being a boy. His voice was deeper than in any of his movies back then, and on the verge of growing. The Rich's own $70,000,000,000, and Richie has his own Mcdonald's, extreme roller coaster, a diversion I forget what you call that launches you up in the air and lands you on a mattress, and four wheelers to name a few! Reggie Jackson is his baseball coach and Arnold is his fitness trainer! he has Herbert Cadberry, as his very likable and proper butler. Richie Miraculously possesses all this, while still being likable and not a brat. Mac may seem like a spoiled brat in real life, but I know he's a likable person, his parents just gave him it. he's not like Brad Renfro. Richie has class with a hilarious teacher played once again by Ben Stein, in the same way he plays the economics teacher that gave him his name, only funnier here. The only thing he doesn't have is friends. He meets some sandlot kids, which makes him yearn deeply for friends, so he becomes aqquainted with them. The kids include, the Mr. COOL kid, the overweight kid that eats a lot, the jock, and one that seems stuck-up and bossy until a little later. the villain is the industries top executive, Laurence Van Dough (John Larroquette) who arranges for Richie and his parents to be killed in a plane by a bomb, but Richie wasn't even in it, and his parents survive by floating on the inflatable boat. The action is great and goes on for a long time with violence and weapons, and Cadberry dresses up like a gangster, high tech spying, fatal suspense in the science lab, and a great climax on Mt. Richmore. Profanity, one damn, and one "s" word.

Yes, I am not a member of his fan club and for the most part I hate nearly everything he was in. My favorite scene with him is the one in "The Good Son" involving the cliff. I had a nice laugh with that one. Here there is no such scene and the film might as well be called "Home Alone 3: this time the kids rich!" as it has almost the same premise. Granted the parents did not really leave him, but rather got into an airplane crash, but it is essentially the same as that brat is in this one too. So the story is the kid is lonely and tries to make friends, parents disappear after a plane crash, some dude is trying to get all the money for himself and there is no robot like there was in the original cartoon still trying to debate if that is a bad or good thing. All I know is that the film for the most part is cringe worthy, but as I have said I can not stand Macualay at all so I am going to tend to be against anything he is in. I did not like "Uncle Buck", "Home Alone" or any of the movies he has been in. Except for said scene, ah yes plunge to your death you spoiled sack of...ahem, the only reason I give this movie a two is that there was a joke in it that actually got me to laughing involving this laser or something blowing a chunk out of a stone statue. Other than that, barf.

Easy to watch and follow, quick-paced and likeable characters. It's a good show to watch with your younger kids.

I know, "Richie Rich" is supposed to be more about making friends than about wealth, but it doesn't work. The whole thing about the cabal trying to seize his money was merely an excuse for what was basically a glorification of money. I think that there's a reason that Macaulay Culkin disappeared after this movie (although that was already coming). There are some clever lines - namely the Michael Jackson comment - but there are plenty of good movies out there, so there's NO REASON to waste your time on this. Also starring John Larroquette, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole and Jonathan Hyde; they probably don't wish to include this on their resumes.

You know what, there was a lot to like in this movie. Generally, cartoons don't translate well to live action movies, but I'd say that this one wasn't too bad. Earlier in 1994 "The Flintstones" was a major flop, but that's because they diverged from the source material. "Richie Rich" stayed true to its cartoon roots.Some of the aspects of it were inane, but I liked that Richie Rich desired friendship more than money and his money never made him an unbearable brat. I also liked that his parents were grounded and not morally ruined by their money. Finally, I appreciated that the working class kids readily accepted Richie as a friend without having ulterior motives.I think it's easy to be critical of "Richie Rich," but I found it refreshing not to have the same old stereotypical characters. So, if it gets any bonus points, it gets bonus points for not using the same old tropes.

While 1994 was a great year to be Green Day or The Offspring, this was not so for the young Macaulay Culkin and his fans. As a 14 year old playing the younger 12 year "richest kid in the world", Culkin and his management must have realized quickly that he could not stay a child actor forever. Richie Rich, therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23-year-old young adult in 2003's Party Monster.In "Rich", no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between, especially for a family comedy. The post-Jurassic Park CGI "robot bee" may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault, anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside; that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep.Had the film starred another adolescent lead, we may have been forgiving, but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck, the Home Alone pictures, My Girl, and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute "Black or White" rampage. Being that it was filmed in and around the Chicagoland area, and that this reviewer is a sucker for anything local, this reviewer feels generous giving Richie Rich 4 out of 10 IMDb stars.

This movie was enjoyable at first. I wasn't expecting this second film of Richie Rich. As the classic Christmas movie. Otherwise is a comedy classical orginal one. I must say the better movie RICHIE RICHIE CHRISTMAS WISH. The cast richie rich, professor Keenbean, Cadbury, dollar dollar the dog the originally cast. Eventhough from the character role professor keenbean I love his science invention there pretty cool . Cadbury character role a nice butler who became a bad twisted gangster. Dollar the dog character role amazing in a cool way. From rich I can't say anymore. In the conclusion good movie

From director Donald Petrie (Mystic Pizza, Miss Congeniality), this is a film that probably got many kids saving their pocket money, I certainly wished I was rich. Basically Richie Rich (Razzie nominated Macaulay Culkin) is the richest kid in the world with unlimited wealth and everything he could ever want. There is one thing thing he doesn't have that he longs for, a normal life with some friends, but one day he sees some kids playing baseball and wants to join them, but they don't want him around. Richie manages to get them to like him however when he invites them to enjoy themselves to his mansion and all its luxuries, including a roller-coaster and a McDonald's restaurant. Meanwhile, Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette), the Rich family's executive is planning to kill the family and steal their fortune, so when Richie realises, he with his new friends and trusted English butler Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) plan to stop him. Also starring Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich, Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich, Michael McShane as Professor Keenbean, Chelcie Ross as Ferguson, Mariangela Pino as Diane Pazinski, Stephi Lineburg as Gloria Pazinski, Michael Maccarone as Tony and Claudia Schiffer as Aerobics Instructor. It has its moments of slapstick for the kids, but it is nowhere as entertaining as Home Alone, especially with Culkin reaching the age of 14 and nearly an adolescent. Okay!

Great movie, edited well and entertaining. Jonathan Hyde's acting is fantastic.

One may wonder if this was even acting, considering Kevin ... I'm sorry I mean Macauly Culkin, was on the top of his game. On a throne of sorts after the Home alone movies that made him. This was going to show a different side to him. I guess and he is rather likeable in this one. I assumed we would get an obnoxious rich kid, but the pressing matters lie elsewhere.So he may be a bit (a lot?) spoiled, but he also knows right from wrong. Which I reckon has a lot to do with his personal servant. Political correctness aside, the movie can be fun. Just let its silliness run through you and all will be well. It also has not aged that badly I have to admit

I love Culkin. He was great and this film is unfortunately not one of his best. But it still had some laughs here and there. But the Home Alone's are the must see over anything if you're going to watch Culkin.
