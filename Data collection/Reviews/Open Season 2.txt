The first movie in this series was pretty funny. A nice lady spoils a funny bear. Bear is befriended by a funnier deer. Bear gets run out of town, but open season is upon them.The really funny stuff is when all the forest animals get back at the hunters.The sequel does not occur during open season, so why they called it Open Season 2 is beyond me. Other than having the same characters it has nothing to do with open season.The story is kind of lame (Mr Weenie is taken back by his owners and the forest animals go off to find him).To top it all off, Ashton Kutcher is not playing Elliot, and the guy who replaces him (Joel McHale) is nowhere near as good at it.I had not read much about this movie before picking it up, and had an idea it might have something to do with the hunters coming back for revenge (thus Open Season 2). Once I saw the cover though, I knew it would be more cute than funny.The rest of the animal characters are pretty cool. The poodle Fifi was down right scary, reminded me of Hannibal. Of course Georgette Franklin Baxter as Mr Weenie's owner is always a treat.Sure, go ahead and buy it for the kids, but this time the adults might want to find something else to do while the kids watch.

I'm an animator myself... so thereby an animation geek. I really liked the first open season movie. Didn't love it.... but liked it. When I saw it again a couple of weeks ago I thought it didn't feel as good as it did the first time. The story isn't just good enough to watch more then once... maybe twice. But I absolutely loved the look and design of the film. So when Open Season 2 was lying in the shelfs at the local DVD store I bought it right away. Hoping it would be as good or hopefully better then the first one. Just a nice animated film with some humor. I expected nothing more nothing less. But Open season 2 is a real let down. All I can say is that it feels like the just didn't rewrite the script. Stuck with all there first ideas and just rushed it out the door. Even the animation doesn't feel as solid as the first movie. It had some funny moments and some really nice characters. But it wasn't worth the money I paid for it. Maybe kids will love this... but as an adult... just don't expect to see a movie that will have the extra layer so you to can enjoy it as much as your kid would. Still... Boog the bear... for me is one of the best designs of a bear ever.

Elliott (Joel McHale) is getting married to Giselle (Jane Krakowski). His rack of antlers is broken once again. Dog Mr Weenie has escaped his owners to be wild. When his owners recapture him, Elliott decide to rescue him. The gang of wild animals must journey to the pet resort before Mr Weenie is completely brainwashed.First off, they recast the voices. It's obvious that this is a franchise being downgraded. The animation hasn't changed. The level of danger is much lower. The stakes at risk seems much lower. It is full of bright colors but dull silly story. It's definitely a franchise lowering their expectations.

I don't want to spend too much time on this one simply because it doesn't deserve it. Well the movie has a weak storyline and all every twist felt like we knew that it'd happen. so story is a disappointment, which ultimately let down the whole movie watching experience. Compared to its first part movie fails to capture our attention though there are some moments of laughter all because of 'Eli the goose' but lack of twists and aimless story creates a dullness so totally trash it.. it is a let down on behalf of the first part. and it is painful when you admired the first one.why watch it??1- if you are great fan of the first part. 2- Good for kids.. who doesn't want to meet a bear like BOOG in their childhood. 3- If you love CGI animation. 4- Your friend is letting you borrow this title then it is OK to kill one hours time viewing it. 5- if you don't bother about the story at all.

Having watched and enjoyed the first film, Open Season (2006), I was intrigued to see how the, straight to DVD, sequel would turn out. The woodland animals, having defeated hunters and befriended the domestic sausage dog, Mr Weenie, in the first film are up to their old tricks again. This time it's a rescue mission.On the day of his wedding to Giselle, Elliot, a deer, starts to have second thoughts when he sees Mr Weenie being kidnapped by the family that lost him in the first place. Deferring wedding plans, he persuades a group of the animals to go and rescue the stricken pet. The small group includes Boog, the bear, Giselle, Elliot's intended (also a deer) and McSquizzy, a squirrel with attitude. Meanwhile, Mr Weenie is being taken to a fun park designed for humans and their pets. We meet many new characters, including Fifi, a pampered pooch with a great hatred of all things wild. Fifi tries to re-domesticate Mr Weenie, but fails and we are all set up for a great rescue attempt at the fun park! There is quite a lot more to the plot, but I don't want to give away too many spoilers.Well animated, although I felt that Fifi looked a bit too much like a sheep. It will never win any prizes, but I thought it was quite a well made film with a decent pace and plenty of jokes. Decent performances from the voice talents of, Joel McHale as Elliot, Mike Epps as Boog, Jane Krakowski as Giselle, Billy Connolly as McSquizzy and Crispin Glover as Fifi.Although I found the character of Elliot pretty annoying there is plenty of other things going on to distract from this rather irksome character. If anything I thought the plot might be a little too complicated for younger viewers but still pretty good. Having said that, there are some real 'laugh out loud' moments. My favourite character is Roger, the cat. You'll know what I mean if you've seen it. Over all, recommended, if only for those 'laugh out loud' moments of which there are several.My score: 6.2/10

With Open Season 1 being so original and full of laughs, this sequel is such a sad disappointment. We laughed ten times during the 60 second preview scenes from Open Season 1 and maybe three times in all of #2. The plot is a very trite adult theme of fear of commitment before getting married. Kids don't care about this theme and adults have seen it a million times. Blah, blah, boring. Lets see, a but* crack joke- so funny, never seen it before. What passes for humor in the other plot line is some sort of play on military torture- is this funny for anyone- especially kids? There was a creative pet paradise setting-umm that's it. What a wasted evening.

Well, I can't say that the story is something to talk about, but the characters are INCREDIBLE, every single one of them is unique, funny, and fits perfectly in the movie. If you didn't like Open Season 1 and you find that a reason not to watch Open Season 2, think again! From hundreds of reasons it is worth of a watch even only to see a cat named Roger, I think that is the most original and the funniest animated character I ever saw in a cartoon! I cant really remember the name of that cat breed that it represents, but in moment I saw the cat I knew what were they trying to say. Every animal in the movie is represented just like it's appearance speaks, but much more deeply and originally.

This is by FAR the worst animation movie ever created by man. its also a horrible sequel to an OK movie. i think it is a Wayan brothers movie but with animation. all the stupid jokes about food, farts, sex, homosexuality and other mind numbingly stupid stuff. in fact you can see how bad this movie by watching just the first 5 min. this is the worst way you wan spend your time either if you are a child or an adult. technically, this movie doesn't have anything to keep you watching it till the end, you do not know exactly what you are supposed to do, who should you like and how you want this movie to end. and these are the basics for any animation movie that is aimed at children, youngsters and animation loving adults.

Ok this sequel isn't as good as the 1st and 3rd one because theres a little hint of cringe in it, basically the movie starts with Elliot who for some reason has huge antlers? How does that happen in like 1 week after open season 1? It turns out elliot and Giselle (some bland doe character who elliot loves) is getting married? Once again, how does this happen to quickly?! The animals new friend Mr. Weenie (that dachshund that was found) misses his owner (Bobbie) ok I guess this is Mr. Weenies film now? And more events happen, the ending....it ends with the most cringiest version of close to you you will ever hear...yeah this one kinda failed....

Our furry friends awaken from hibernation just in time for Elliot and Giselle's spring wedding. But in the middle of the ceremony Elloit, voiced by John McHale, gets cold feet. He thinks Mr. Weenie, voiced by Cody Cameron, is being captured by an evil women, who in actuality is his former owner. Giselle suggest putting the wedding on hold to search for Mr. Weenie. Elliot and the rest of the forest gang agree. So they set out on a dangerous and exciting quest to find their friend. My favorite characters are Fifi voiced by Crispin Glover because even though he is small in size. He has a big "I'm in charge" attitude. I also like Giselle, voiced by Jan Krakowski, because she is pretty, graceful, smart and a great tracker. My favorite scene is when Giselle and McSquizzy disguise themselves as dogs to sneak into Pet Paradiso. That is brilliant! I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend this movie to kids of all ages. Because it is funny and it has a silly plot. Reviewed by Ny'Asia Bell, age 8, KIDS FIRST!

This isnt quite as soul crushing as Disneys direct to video sequels, but it's definitely more boring, cringe worthy, and just outright not funny at all, I would give it a worse score, but just compared to Disney's sequels, it's not terrible, it's fine.

It's still not quite funny as it's intended to be. The story strays father from the original look at hunting to those of wild versus domestic animals. The change in the voice actor cast is also very noticeable. Strange enough that though Ashton Kutcher wasn't even that funny on the first movie, the voice actor filling in for his shoes as Elliot doesn't really get near what Kutcher has done for it. So do for Boog. Here Boog loses his rather chilled out lazier mood and got replaced with a more active Boog. It's quite logical considering this movie sets about one year after the first, but still it's strange considering that Boog still retains his body shape and weight, LOL.

This movie doesn't have a good cast, and the acting is mediocre. Not very substantial to the first movie

I love animation, and while it had a few imperfections I did enjoy the first Open Season movie. But I personally didn't care for this sequel. It does have its good points, some of the animation is quite colourful and vibrant, the soundtrack is at least tolerable, the film starts off quite nicely and the voice acting is mostly good. Aside from that, Open Season 2 lacks the charm and fun the first did. While there is some nice-looking animation especially in the colours, there is the odd background that lacks finesse and some of the character designs looked blocky. The characters aren't as likable or as endearing, the story is predictable and rushed and while there are some humorous spots the writing lacks one vital ingredient, freshness. Also in regards to the latter point, most of the jokes are lame and miss the mark, some of them as well come so fast I had to re-wind the DVD(yes I rented it) numerous times to "get" them. All in all, it has its moments, but this sequel is rather bland and charmless to live up to an least watchable first film. 4/10 Bethany Cox

"Open Season", a 2006 Sony Pictures Animation production, turned out to be one of the more polarizing computer animated efforts of the past decade, and knowing that before I finally saw it for the first time just several months ago, four years after it came out, I wasn't surprised when I found it to be a mixture of good and not so good. The quality certainly wasn't enough to make me feel the need to watch this first sequel, "Open Season 2", right away. If the original had been much weaker (or probably even just a little weaker) than it is, I doubt I would have bothered watching this 2008 sequel at all. However, I have now seen it, and unfortunately but unsurprisingly, it can't even match the quality of the somewhat bland original.Boog the bear and Elliot the mule deer now live in the forest together with several other animal friends. The deer has grown new antlers and is about to get married to Giselle, but before the wedding, he is very upset when he accidentally breaks those antlers. At the wedding, Elliot finds that he isn't quite sure if he wants to marry Giselle anymore. Meanwhile, Mr. Weenie, a domestic dog who escaped into the wild, has found a trail of dog biscuits left by his owners, Bob and Bobbie, and can't resist the temptation to eat them, so he eats along the trail and inevitably gets caught by his owners, who take him away in their RV! When Elliot sees this, he tells the other animals at the wedding, so the ceremony is cut off, and the deer sets out with Boog, Giselle, and several other animals that live in this forest on a mission to rescue Mr. Weenie. While they are on this mission, the dog they're looking for finds himself back with a group of other tame dogs led by Fifi, a toy poodle who hates wild animals! When I watched the original, it seemed to me that the backgrounds looked more primitive than those of any other CGI animated feature I had ever seen. Well, the backgrounds in this sequel are the same. So, the animation is one of the flaws in "Open Season 2", but it's certainly not the only one. I didn't find the first "Open Season" THAT funny, but I hardly watched any of the gags in this sequel without keeping a straight face. Elliot takes Boog's place as the main protagonist here, and his freak-outs and such are generally not funny. That's also the case with the antics of Bobbie, Mr. Weenie's over-affectionate owner (I can see why Mr. Weenie wouldn't want to live with her), and the other characters who are supposed to be funny. The occasional toilet humour also doesn't work, though that's not to say that toilet humour is never funny. I would say the plot of this first sequel is also a bit bland, and I definitely didn't find as much excitement in it as I did in the plot of its predecessor, even if I occasionally found some of it.This was the first movie I watched after "Monster House", another CGI film which Sony Pictures Animation was also involved in the production of, and I have to say, that film is much better than both of the "Open Season" ones I've seen. "Surf's Up", another Sony Pictures film, the one which led me to watch "Open Season" last November, also far exceeds the 2006 anthropomorphic wildlife feature from the same company in quality. Even though "Monster House" and "Surf's Up" haven't spawned any sequels and "Open Season" has now spawned two, the other two CGI animated films I've mentioned are clearly more popular, which I can understand perfectly. "Open Season 3" has recently come out, but I'm certainly in no hurry to see it, and I'm sure NEVER seeing it wouldn't be a great loss, as it seems to be even less popular than this second installment. Even if you like the first film a lot more than I do, this first sequel could still be disappointing to you, which I guess is very often the case with sequels.

It is full of bright colors but dull silly story. It's definitely a franchise lowering their expectations.

I loved the first open season, for me its not just for kids, there was a sense of intelligence about the whole storyline, I found it funny and very easy to follow, Ashton kutcher being Elliot made it even better! There is just something about his voice that's funny. But after watching this, its like a totally different sort of film, the whole thing is all over the place with scenes cutting in quickly, different sorts of music accompanying the script, its just makes it so hard to follow, a complete mess in my opinion. There was nothing intelligent about this film at all and yes maybe a kid may enjoy the colour and the silliness but its a complete let down from my prospective. The actual script itself is just so silly and makes no sense, the one other major huge let down is that Ashton Kutcher is no where to be heard, the character Elliot is no longer funny, the voice is just a bit flaccid and has no edge or likability factor. One other thing I must mention is also the animation quality seems to have suffered as well, there is just something off about the scenes where it doesn't seem no where near enjoyable visually then the first one.My advice would be if you enjoyed for the first one like I did then don't bother watching this and just keep the memory of the original.

I love animated movies, I really do, they seem to have a genuinely happy feel to them, so when I sat down to this movie I had already seen the first open season, and I knew that there were different voice actors and the first one wasn't brilliant, so I just expected it to be a mediocre movie with a few laughs here and there.I was surprised, because I really enjoyed it.When compared with Madagascar 2, it doesn't stand up at all, but in its own right it is a very fun movie with some hilarious moments, mainly involving the white furball poodle type dog with the most amazing voice actor for the character.I don't want to give anything away, but that character alone could keep me entertained for a few hours.The animation is OK, there are points where it is great, and points where it looks like it was made in the 80s by a schoolkid, but generally it is OK, it does the job, and that is all that matters.The voice acting is top notch, especially considering 2 of the characters (Boog and Elliot) have been voiced by different people, I honestly thought that it was Martin Lawrence voicing Boog, so hats off to Mike Epps.The story is simple but effective. It simply tells the story of a daschund called Mr Weeny who was with the "gang" after escaping from his owners, which are an over loving woman and a guy that wasn't concentrated on very much.Basically Mr Weeny gets found by her again, and Elliott sees her pick Mr Weeny up and he thinks she is hurting him, and the movie starts on their journey to find Mr Weeny.There are other sub stories as well, but I don't want to spoil the movie, because although it isn't brilliant, it is still good enough to stick on for a few laughs on the cold winter evenings.All in all, I gave this 7 out of 10, I would give it 8 but the animation problems knocked it down a point.If it wasn't for the amazing voice acting and the white poofy poodle thing it would have been much less.I do recommend it though, if you have nothing else to watch, you will not regret watching this.

For the longest time, I've been a fan of the original Open Season movie, but this sequel kills it! One year after the first one, Elliot and Giselle are about to get married, but their wedding ceremony has been hold off when Mr. Weenie is capture by his owners and hold hostage by a group of dogs and cats. It's up to them to save Mr. Weenie before it's too late! This sequel doesn't stand up to the first movie that well. Story was too rushed, characters didn't act like their normal selves (most of them didn't) and the animation was okay, but the dialogue grew pretty bland.Open Season is no Disney movie, but I think Sony Pictures could of try to do better if it wasn't in a hurry to be made. Lots of animated take time to be made, but sequels shouldn't if the fans want more. Parts in it were a little bit boring but not so much interesting. I thought I was watching more of a quick short than to be focusing on a one single movie. The time in it was too fast! I would suggest renting if you guys know what's best for you. Don't buy! You don't need to waste money on it even if you're a fan of the original like I am!

Having watched and enjoyed the first film, Open Season (2006), I was intrigued to see how the, straight to DVD, sequel would turn out.

I cant really remember the name of that cat breed that it represents, but in moment I saw the cat I knew what were they trying to say. Every animal in the movie is represented just like it's appearance speaks, but much more deeply and originally.

This animation is about a bunch of wild animals who goes on a trip to rescue their previously domesticated friend, who got recaptured by is owner.I find "Open Season 2" very similar to "Shrek", but a lot simpler and aimed at younger viewers. The story is fun and engaging. The dog, Mr Weenie is fun, and I like his German accent! Fifi makes me laugh too, as the vanity and beauty of Fifi clashes with his masculine voice and aggressive character. I liked the story as it celebrates friendship, and shows that sometimes it takes teamwork to achieve a common goal. The merry mishaps along the way are fun to watch.

This is my first review, and I'll choose a 50/50 movie.This movie wasn't that great. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I had hoped for a sequel that was creative, like the first one, that played with my emotions, like the first one, and that made me feel for the characters, like the first one.This movie's plot wasn't original at all. Or maybe it was, but it wasn't very creative. I mean, we go from a marriage that was stopped in an awkward moment, and then next thing you know these characters are trying to chase a dog that they, initially shouldn't have met in the last film. Now they spend the whole movie trying to find and rescue the dog, only to find out at the end that the dog is happier with his dog friends and owners.So the wild animations wasted how much of their time rescuing a dog that ends up leaving them, this time for good? At least the marriage was finished, with an awkward song that panned through each dog 'couple'. One thing that did crack me up with the man who never speaks, when he finally sang his one note, and almost crashed.Speaking of annoying scenes and characters, what's with the white fluffy dog who was the boss of the 'gang' and would repeat everything? Very annoying, I'm glad he got shocked with the collar at the end.So ultimately, this movie could have had a better plot. Don't waste time saving an animal that will just leave you again anyway. And make the animation better, not the same.

The bear is super adorable but the dumb deer & the white poodle kill it because they're too irritating. This one has too much focus on the mean poodle & the clutsy dumb deer. I need more of the lovable bear. I will stick to the first one.

This is by FAR the worst animation movie ever created by man. its also a horrible sequel to an OK movie. i think it is a Wayan brothers movie but with animation. all the stupid jokes about food, farts, sex, homosexuality and other mind numbingly stupid stuff. in fact you can see how bad this movie by watching just the first 5 min. this is the worst way you wan spend your time either if you are a child or an adult. technically, this movie doesn't have anything to keep you watching it till the end, you do not know exactly what you are supposed to do, who should you like and how you want this movie to end. and these are the basics for any animation movie that is aimed at children, youngsters and animation loving adults.

Good animation at times, but looks like something from an outdated game demo from a PC magazine. Good for a boring day when the family wants some furry fun.

"Open Season" shocked me. I had very low expectations but ended up really enjoying the film. And, as a result, I did something I rarely do....I saw the sequel. However, when it began I realized there was a big problem...the voice actors are all different. Were Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher THAT expensive that they couldn't afford them again?! Or, did Sony Studios simply offer us a cynical film...much like the many, many unnecessary sequels to "Madagascar"? After all, this one and its sequel were all released direct to DVD.The second thing I noticed after I saw the voice actors were different is that the CGI was poor--worse than the original film which was made two years earlier. In fact, some of the characters (such as Giselle) were just plain ugly...poorly rendered and cheap looking.So far, I was NOT impressed. Perhaps the story itself is worth seeing....right?! Well, perhaps...perhaps not. I did not appreciate that the plot revolved around Mr. Weenie--a minor charcter from the first film. Boog and Elliot were GREAT characters yet the film emphasizes Weenie...which is odd. Overall, a disappointing and unnecessary film that lacked the charm and originality and quality of the first movie.

our funny animals are back for another round in the sequel to Open season,, I wish that the writers would have had a different storyline,,, because this one didn't click with me,, one of our favorite characters is in love and very happy,, our little deer friend is boasting about his rack / antlers,, and when he falls down his rack breaks,, and therefore his pride,, the "girl" he is interested in wants him to marry her,, and he has a big fear of commitment,, meanwhile, one of our animals is kidnapped by some human pet lovers,, trying to convert him to make him a "Pet" and not a wild animal, so all of the animal kingdom get together to try and find their friend,,, it would seems to me that this sequel was rushed and put out the door as soon as poosible,, this could have been a better movie with a different storyline,, I din't hate the movie,, there is some very funny stuff in here, and some parts are rather enjoyable to watch,, but as a whole the movie does disappoint.

This isnt quite as soul crushing as Disneys direct to video sequels, but it's definitely more boring, cringe worthy, and just outright not funny at all, I would give it a worse score, but just compared to Disney's sequels, it's not terrible, it's fine.

Our furry friends awaken from hibernation just in time for Elliot and Giselle's spring wedding. But in the middle of the ceremony Elloit, voiced by John McHale, gets cold feet. He thinks Mr. Weenie, voiced by Cody Cameron, is being captured by an evil women, who in actuality is his former owner. Giselle suggest putting the wedding on hold to search for Mr. Weenie. Elliot and the rest of the forest gang agree. So they set out on a dangerous and exciting quest to find their friend. My favorite characters are Fifi voiced by Crispin Glover because even though he is small in size. He has a big "I'm in charge" attitude. I also like Giselle, voiced by Jan Krakowski, because she is pretty, graceful, smart and a great tracker. My favorite scene is when Giselle and McSquizzy disguise themselves as dogs to sneak into Pet Paradiso. That is brilliant! I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend this movie to kids of all ages. Because it is funny and it has a silly plot. Reviewed by Ny'Asia Bell, age 8, KIDS FIRST!

It's still not quite funny as it's intended to be. The story strays father from the original look at hunting to those of wild versus domestic animals. The change in the voice actor cast is also very noticeable. Strange enough that though Ashton Kutcher wasn't even that funny on the first movie, the voice actor filling in for his shoes as Elliot doesn't really get near what Kutcher has done for it. So do for Boog. Here Boog loses his rather chilled out lazier mood and got replaced with a more active Boog. It's quite logical considering this movie sets about one year after the first, but still it's strange considering that Boog still retains his body shape and weight, LOL.

Ok this sequel isn't as good as the 1st and 3rd one because theres a little hint of cringe in it, basically the movie starts with Elliot who for some reason has huge antlers? How does that happen in like 1 week after open season 1? It turns out elliot and Giselle (some bland doe character who elliot loves) is getting married? Once again, how does this happen to quickly?! The animals new friend Mr. Weenie (that dachshund that was found) misses his owner (Bobbie) ok I guess this is Mr. Weenies film now? And more events happen, the ending....it ends with the most cringiest version of close to you you will ever hear...yeah this one kinda failed....

This movie doesn't have a good cast, and the acting is mediocre. Not very substantial to the first movie

I love animation, and while it had a few imperfections I did enjoy the first Open Season movie. But I personally didn't care for this sequel. It does have its good points, some of the animation is quite colourful and vibrant, the soundtrack is at least tolerable, the film starts off quite nicely and the voice acting is mostly good. Aside from that, Open Season 2 lacks the charm and fun the first did. While there is some nice-looking animation especially in the colours, there is the odd background that lacks finesse and some of the character designs looked blocky. The characters aren't as likable or as endearing, the story is predictable and rushed and while there are some humorous spots the writing lacks one vital ingredient, freshness. Also in regards to the latter point, most of the jokes are lame and miss the mark, some of them as well come so fast I had to re-wind the DVD(yes I rented it) numerous times to "get" them. All in all, it has its moments, but this sequel is rather bland and charmless to live up to an least watchable first film. 4/10 Bethany Cox

"Open Season", a 2006 Sony Pictures Animation production, turned out to be one of the more polarizing computer animated efforts of the past decade, and knowing that before I finally saw it for the first time just several months ago, four years after it came out, I wasn't surprised when I found it to be a mixture of good and not so good. The quality certainly wasn't enough to make me feel the need to watch this first sequel, "Open Season 2", right away. If the original had been much weaker (or probably even just a little weaker) than it is, I doubt I would have bothered watching this 2008 sequel at all. However, I have now seen it, and unfortunately but unsurprisingly, it can't even match the quality of the somewhat bland original.Boog the bear and Elliot the mule deer now live in the forest together with several other animal friends. The deer has grown new antlers and is about to get married to Giselle, but before the wedding, he is very upset when he accidentally breaks those antlers. At the wedding, Elliot finds that he isn't quite sure if he wants to marry Giselle anymore. Meanwhile, Mr. Weenie, a domestic dog who escaped into the wild, has found a trail of dog biscuits left by his owners, Bob and Bobbie, and can't resist the temptation to eat them, so he eats along the trail and inevitably gets caught by his owners, who take him away in their RV! When Elliot sees this, he tells the other animals at the wedding, so the ceremony is cut off, and the deer sets out with Boog, Giselle, and several other animals that live in this forest on a mission to rescue Mr. Weenie. While they are on this mission, the dog they're looking for finds himself back with a group of other tame dogs led by Fifi, a toy poodle who hates wild animals! When I watched the original, it seemed to me that the backgrounds looked more primitive than those of any other CGI animated feature I had ever seen. Well, the backgrounds in this sequel are the same. So, the animation is one of the flaws in "Open Season 2", but it's certainly not the only one. I didn't find the first "Open Season" THAT funny, but I hardly watched any of the gags in this sequel without keeping a straight face. Elliot takes Boog's place as the main protagonist here, and his freak-outs and such are generally not funny. That's also the case with the antics of Bobbie, Mr. Weenie's over-affectionate owner (I can see why Mr. Weenie wouldn't want to live with her), and the other characters who are supposed to be funny. The occasional toilet humour also doesn't work, though that's not to say that toilet humour is never funny. I would say the plot of this first sequel is also a bit bland, and I definitely didn't find as much excitement in it as I did in the plot of its predecessor, even if I occasionally found some of it.This was the first movie I watched after "Monster House", another CGI film which Sony Pictures Animation was also involved in the production of, and I have to say, that film is much better than both of the "Open Season" ones I've seen. "Surf's Up", another Sony Pictures film, the one which led me to watch "Open Season" last November, also far exceeds the 2006 anthropomorphic wildlife feature from the same company in quality. Even though "Monster House" and "Surf's Up" haven't spawned any sequels and "Open Season" has now spawned two, the other two CGI animated films I've mentioned are clearly more popular, which I can understand perfectly. "Open Season 3" has recently come out, but I'm certainly in no hurry to see it, and I'm sure NEVER seeing it wouldn't be a great loss, as it seems to be even less popular than this second installment. Even if you like the first film a lot more than I do, this first sequel could still be disappointing to you, which I guess is very often the case with sequels.
