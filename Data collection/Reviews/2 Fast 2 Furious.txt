Before I start about anything. I was little disappointed with this movie. So second movie of The Fast and the Furious franchise didn't full my expectations. Brian is the only one of the main characters who stays in this film from the last film crew. The plot get little bit more action then the last movie so they filled up that part. They put the bad guy, so it gets some action. You still got some badass cars, but it is not about tuning this time. Races from 1/4 of a mile sprint now evolve into circuit races and highway chasing and running from police. The film is mainly about undercover mission to catch that bad guys similar to the last movie, but I miss that there is no one else from the old crew. Still this movie deserve 7, and current rate is underrated. Watch this movie, it won't have much roll into plot in later movie, don't have high expectations and you will like it. It is still worth seeing.

What made the first "The Fast and the Furious" movie attracted fans besides the bad ass cars and competition on the streets was Vin Diesel's appearance as Dominic Toretta, a hotshot race driver who makes his money racing others in the streets; he was a rising star on the fame after doing such flicks such as "Saving Private Ryan", "The Iron Giant" and later doing "XXX".At the end of the first movie, Vin's character Dominic flees away to Mexico where he wouldn't be in this sequel.No matter, the series continues on."2 Fast 2 Furious" has Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Conner, the one time agent who betrayed the enforcement agency by letting Dominic get away, is now a fugitive and being in a race competitions every night to make money. After being captured by the police, Brian is given a choice in either going to jail or helped the people he once work for in taking down a drug cartel dealer (Cole Hauser). Brian agrees under one condition that he gets his childhood friend Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson, Transformers) involved since he's into cars and knows his ways around tough people. They're also given an ally, the sexy Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) who's not only an undercover agent but also posing as the enemy's mistress. Time will tell when all will be revealed."2 Fast 2 Furious" is directed by John Singleton of Boyz in the Hood fame where he manages to bring the same energy and high expectations of the first movie. There's more cars, more chase sequences, more babes and more cameos this time around with a high octane pace.Overall, it's good.

With the help of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's chemistry and some intense racing scenes, Rob Cohen's The Fast and the Furious (2001) was an instant hit among racing fans. And like most franchises with critical financial success, a sequel started to be put into the works. Similar to many other sequels, it was distributed two years later and it's difficult to say whether it pleased fans as much as the first one did. According to this site, this is lowest score the franchise has. It wasn't bad at all but it was missing a few elements of the first movie, which left a more entertaining feeling.The story follows ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) back to Miami from Los Angeles where he's enjoying his time racing street cars only to be pulled back by the authorities that he dropped. Heading the authorities is Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) from the first installment and this time he wants O'Conner back one more time to take down a drug lord. And O'Conner can't refuse because he'd go to jail if he didn't accept. Plus, if the drug lord is turned in, all of his criminal charges will disappear. Why does this plot sound like Vin Diesel's xXx (2002) plot line (except it doesn't deal with a drug lord)? Speaking of which, why didn't Vin Diesel return? That's one thing that this franchise consistently needs. Paul Walker is the central character but Vin Diesel's presence was the icing on the cake.Is was nice though that the writers kept the continuity together. The characters do reference material from the first film which shows the producers want to keep the story going and not divert completely from the original. But if there's one thing that comes into question, it is the concept of getting caught having a love interest in the business. This happened in the first movie and it blew O'Conners cover. Here the same thing happens in a similar way. You'd think the lesson was learned. Sigh. The new interest is Eva Mendes and she plays her character well enough. Accompanying O'Conner is Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) an old friend who originally has a grudge for some of his own issues. Even with this though, their chemistry works well.Playing the drug lord is another interesting actor - Cole Hauser. He has a very smooth deep voice and resembles a very young Tom Berenger. He's also able to make his character seem dangerous enough to hurt someone. That's it for characters. The music produced by David Arnold of Stargate (1994) sounded better than BT's score from the first film but it wasn't evident enough. Barely heard a thing. As for action scenes, the racing is still fast paced and contains much of the same film making as the first, which kept the feeling the same. Other than that, the story feels the same as before but without Vin Diesel. It's not a bad follow up to the first movie, but not casting Vin Diesel wasn't smart - it's like missing a piece to a puzzle. Other than that, it's still a decent watch with better music and well-staged action sequences.

This film brings back more of what we loved from the first film with all the cars, girls, and action and multiplies it. However it is still inferior to the first film but that dosen't mean it isn't awesome. This movie has gotten a lot of criticism and i don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie. Some people complained about the lack of plot and the casts acting skills but I don't care about that. I watch these Fast films to be entertained and I was throughly entertained with this one. Even though it dosen't match up to the original it still excels in excitement. I mean how could you go wrong with taking the series to Miami were our eyes will be blessed with dozens of beautiful beach girls. And the races in this movie are also very exciting to. And let's not forget the awesome chase sequence in the film as well. Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson make a great team and show us why this movie is so cool. I still love this movie despite the many negative reviews I've seen and to all the haters I say forget about the plot and just enjoy the perks. This movie is made for entertainment not Oscar awards and as far as entertainment goes It was grade A popcorn style.

The cars, the stunts and the eye candy (Eva Mendes) are better than the first. But unlike the first, 2 Fast 2 Furious still boasts a lacklustre plot. Nevertheless, it's a great "bro" movie for the guys. The partnership between Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is amusing and works well as they team up and do next to impossible driving stunts with each other. The slight romance between Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and Brian O'Connor is predictable, but it's not to the same extent as the first one - just a bit of flirtation but not to the extent of a full fledged relationship. The Miami backdrop adds to the "upgrade" feel of the second movie in the Fast & Furious franchise. Flashy and full of action is 2 Fast, 2 Furious.

Undoubtedly this sequel suffers from the absence of Dom and the Toretto clan, but it still makes for a very enjoyable ride.The plot is a little bit derivative of the first, following Brian on an undercover op, but it is a pretty fun story nonetheless.We get to meet new characters Tej and Roman, who grow to become franchise regulars, and their introductions are very solid.The direction is fairly slick. Some of the awkward choppy camera shots and whiplash inducing cuts remain, but there's plenty of impressive camera work in here too.What I really enjoyed about this film though was the general tone. It is energetic and sleek and despite its flaws always carries a certain amount of charm and appeal.

Lordy Lord! Another crap sequel from the Hollywood stable of rubbish rehashes. I had low expectations of this movie....it doesn't have Vin Diesel in it for a start. But what I got was a collection of wooden actors and cheesy lines, interspersed with "race" sequences that made me laugh a lot. I should have realised it was going to be dire literally from the get-go. The Universal logo mutates into a chrome-plated wheel in the most irritatingly ludicrous manner. Spoilers ahead.So what is so horrible about this film? For a start the acting sucks worse than a Dyson. The opening race meet scene had me cringing in my seat, hoping it would get better. It didn't. Then there's the plot, or lack of one. Let's rehash the first film and nobody'll notice. Bah!The scripting is awful. The hero's buddy (name escapes me due to disinterest) actually steals something from a supposed drug-baron (again not sure if he was a drug-baron, was fighting the urge to read the paper at the time) whilst the latter is offering him a job. Come on! That makes about as much sense as ....well....nothing! You just would not do that, unless you were the world's most retarded individual. Sadly, his character survives the movie. Then there's the villain's two goons, who come across as stereotypical thick grunts who haven't had an original thought between them for years. Tiresomely predictable.The cars all look like they've escaped from a Scalextric set, with the exception of the hero's racer, which has had the "mobile tanning salon" upgrade. Damn, but he's gonna get skin cancer and cattaracts if he continues to drive that! Then you have to wonder just what sort of engine can accelerate a car from 0-80 in gasp!, only 20 seconds! Such speed! G-Forces pulling.....can't continue.....review.....must hit....brake! Yep, I could take my old Vauxhall Vectra out and give these machines a run for their money! Twenty seconds....sheeeshh!The crowning hilarity regarding the race scenes was that a) the cars apparently needed nitrous to reach 100mph, and b) When they hit the nitro the cars went into hyperspace. I'm serious! Everything blurred and streaked past. Everytime it happened I kept expecting to see Chewbacca pop up from the back, waving a wrench and going "Whoooaarrhg!" Give me a break!  I have to say this had me in stitches every time it happened but I'm surprised they didn't resort to burning tire-tracks a la Back to the Future as well. So lame.Another annoying fact is that Hollywood seems to think that 80mph is fast and 100mph only reachable by real racer types. Obviously they've never been on any British motorway. And our hero clocked 150mph in his death-defying leap off a bridge. It would all perhaps seem more impressive than it was, if the streets were narrower, or you actually cared about any of the characters. Or that a motorcyclist wasn't clocked on the M1 doing 157 mph. And he didn't even have R2D2 on the back, much less Chewie.So, underwhelmed would be the best word to sum up this film. The racing isn't exciting, the acting is bad and the plot is some Miami Vice reworking with incredulous bits thrown in for bad measure. All in all, a better name for this film might have been "The Dull and the Repetitive"

Without the assistance of a fugitive on the run Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who is AWOL here), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who's still a marked man with the FBI leaves Los Angeles and travels around the USA to compete in drag races and making new friends along the way as well as a substantial amount of money. It wasn't before long that the cops found his car and now he has to travels by foot. Until a lady drops him off at a car lot and his money he purchases a blue car and paints it silver. O'Connor ventures off to Miami where he reunites with ex-con Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) as they join forces with the FBI to track down a shady dealer named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), but only in exchange if they erase his criminal records. They are also joined by Secret Agent Monica Fuentes to bring this sleazy miscreant to justice.Unlike a lot of sequels where they don't measure up to the first instalments "2 Fast 2 Furious" succeeds in equalling up to the first instalment to maybe even being better (even without Vin Diesel). This movie like the first film is loaded with all the usual formulaic by-the-numbers mixed bag of clichés like the token slimy gangster and his dim-witted gang of goons, corrupt cops, by-the-book FBI agent and his determined sidekick and whatnot. But people who see this movie aren't here to see that. Hell no! We've come to see exciting drag races, cars crashing into each other, fight scenes, over-the-top humour (not Shakespaere), epic fights and most of all cool cars and hot girls.With Vin Diesel out of the picture, Paul Walker takes the central role as Brian O'Connor an former LAPD on the run and locating himself in Miami to capture a sleazy dealer in exchange that for his criminal charges to be eradicated. And he turns in a wonderful performance, even though it just feels at time forced, but in a funny way. Why funny? Because he just seems a bit to old to be talking like the way he does. His dialogue makes him sound like an adolescent who's been living in the basement of an LA public school and has picked up on their lingo. Roman Pearce (Gibson) is O'Connor's sidekick is no Dominic Toretto is still a capable replacement and has just as much charisma to pull it off.This movie is no different than the Land of Make Believe. It doesn't exist. It's all surreal. It's the threshold where the bad-assed dudes hang out, where drag racing is a pastime and not an illegality. Where the ladies let it loose and enjoy every moment of it. This utopia has our two heroes who constantly bicker like two teens arguing over who's pizza slice is bigger. In a world like this, there are no real good guys, and the badder you are, the greater your odds at survivor are in your favour. In action films this has been a common trend since Jason Statham starring in "The Transporter" as he played a hero who was a lackey for the underworld. These days, being a cookie-cutter hero is obsolete, it's a fight between bad guys and even more bad guys. O'Connor and Pearce confiscate drug money, but they take it before the cops grab their hands on the dough. It makes you wondering if the producers know who's coming to see this film or maybe not. It may feel at times like they're glorifying the audience watching it giving the impression those watching it are dumber than rocks.But once the smoke is cleared the real stars are the awesome cars. They grind, they release steam and most of all, they make a lot of noise that it's not too late to purchase some earplugs. The opening drag race will likely have your heart beating faster than a thousand bees in a hive. Vin Diesel was not the only one who departed as Rob Cohen took an exodus as John Singleton took over the director's chair which is quite surprising since Singleton back in 1991 directed the ever so powerful drama "Boyz in the Hood". What happened? I guess under a more competent director should come to no fluke that this film is 5x better than the first instalment.We know that the target audience was intended for the teen male audience between the ages of 15-20 years old. Their girlfriends knew what was coming to them when they joined them in this atmosphere and quite frankly, we never outgrow these kind of movies. Fast cars, exciting action and hot babes, what more do you need?

2 Fast 2 Furious lives up to its title and delivers some very cool scenes. Brian O'Connor {Paul Walker}, now a disgraced cop, fell victim to it--and now he's paying the price. As far as his bosses and the FBI brass are concerned, the hothead undercover officer threw one of their largest investigations ever. After losing his badge and any chance of redemption along with it, O'Connor is given one last chance when the feds in Miami need his help to collar Carter Verone, a flashy businessman whose using his import/export business as a cover for an international money laundering cartel. Brian isn't alone though as he has his old friend Roman Pearce {Tyrese} and undercover agent Monica Fuentes{ Eva Mendes} to help him out. The plot may sound bad and if you can't look past it then this isn't the film for you. This film is only worth watching if there are exciting action scenes. For the most part, the film doesn't disappoint in that category but the rest of the film isn't very strong. The acting is bad, worse then the original even. Paul Walker doesn't have enough charisma to be a lead and he also doesn't have much talent. Eva Mendes does an okay job and she is probably the best actress in this film. Tyrese should stick to modeling as his acting is very poor. Ludicrous may have top billing but he isn't in the film very much. Cole Hauser does an average job of playing a bad guy. He isn't about to set the world on fire but his performance isn't terrible either. John Singleton directs and does a better job then Rob Cohen did yet the film is still lacking in a good story. 2 Fast 2 Furious is a sequel in the loosest definition of the word. Only one star returns, there's a new director, actors, producers etc. It doesn't really matter though as the cars are the real stars. The cars in this film are pretty cool and look really nice. This film is of course very unrealistic as some of the stunts break the laws of gravity. The running time is 107 minutes though sometimes the film seems longer. A lot of people were complaining that Vin wasn't in this one. I'm kind of glad though as he wasn't that impressive in the original. Is this one better then the original? I liked it more as it wasn't as boring as the original. In the end, this film has plenty of action to deliver but not much in the story or the acting which brings it down. Rating 6/10, above average action flick.

This film is more of an action comedy then an action which the first film was. This film is about Brian O' Conner who goes back to fighting crime with his buddy Roman Pearce and secret agent Monica Fuentes to bring down the notorious criminal Carter Verone. What I think people don't get about this film is unlike the first, this film is just plain out in good 'ol fun. This is definitely not meant not to be serious at any level. I would think people could tell just by how the actors play their characters. The acting is very good because you can see that the actors are having fun doing this flick to make it an actual fun movie. Even though it is a fun film, the action scenes are great. Like when the car flies onto that boat; I thought that was awesome!!This film is like a mix of "Hollywood Homicide" and "The French Connection"Overall I think this is a great little afternoon sit on the couch on a sunny day and leave the screen door open movie.My take: 10/10

2 Fast 2 Furious: 5/10: Okay so it's car porn. It's rather well done car porn. Stunningly brainless but rather fun in places 2 Fast 2 Furious gives us a candy colored version of street racing with a plot that is best not even discussed. After all you don't watch this for the plot. You watch it for the cars. A giant product placement for Mitsubishi among others the cars and characters are right out of a video game (the paint jobs match the personalities) and kudos to the filmmakers for keeping the CGI to a minimum. The movie made me want to trick out my old Dodge Dart.(Electric Blue paint job with matching neon on yeah baby). Director John Singletary moves the cars around like he has been directing Burt Reynolds's movies all his life. (This is not a criticism and the fact he avoids Cannonball Run style humor is another plus.) Singletary who usually films much more important movies, (what's next Scorsese's Jaws 5 or Spike Lee's Ella Enchanted 2 Ella in Da Hood? Actually the way some of Spike's recent films have gone this may not be a bad idea) keeps the pace tight and the actors attractive.However all is not peachy keen. For example I haven't seen African American hairstyles this bad since Cotton came to Harlem. The Tyrese character comes across as a complete idiot almost sinking the movie once or twice. (Now I know Tyrese can act I saw Baby Boy.) Another quick note I have driven cars with nitrous oxide and they give you a burst of acceleration not warp speed effects from Star Trek. (And lets face it the Mitishibishi cars are pretty but not fast. These cars are dragging down a strip after a minute and the speedometer finally moves from 90 to 120 my Dart has better acceleration after 60 sixty seconds.The movie, to its credit, acknowledges when the cars get whooped by some old American muscle. I know I promised not to discuss the plot but one thing. If you needed someone to drive a couple of million dollars from Miami to Key West (all of 2 hours on Interstate 95 and Route 1), would you A: hire and old couple in a RV B: Drive it yourself or C: Hire two ex-cons in the flashiest cars you have ever seen and who had to this point been incapable of rounding the block without causing an accident and attracting various state and local agencies. I guess that's why we are not criminal masterminds.

So much greatness in this film I'm shocked it's got a 5.9 rating! John Singleton directed such a wild ride of fun entertainment with the cars, music, neon lights, cinematography, popcorn lines that are loved and engaging story. The characters have the perfect energy; I get such a jolly vibe from 2 Fast 2 Furious every time I see it!

It's not as good as the first and repeats the first film's plot but 2 Fast 2 Furious is still fun due to great performances from Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson and their great chemistry. The enjoyable and over the top action helps as well.

Having seen and enjoyed the first movie I had moderate hope for this one but it looks like yet another sequel that should never have been made.  It's impossible to know just how bad the acting was as dialog was contrived and uncomfortable and probably wouldn't have sounded natural from even the best speakers.  However, bad acting is bad acting and this was certainly about as bad as it comes.  The one exception to this was ludacris who was suprisingly enjoyable while on screen but those times were too short and too far between.  All of this could easily have been forgiven though if the action measured up.  After all, this isn't hamlet right?  Unfortunately "2 fast" fell short here as well unless one likes seeing gear shifts, speed-o needles, and mechanically impossible driving sequences.  In the year of the matrix, the hulk, and later return of the king this one simply wont measure up to it's competition and in the lexicon of exciting driving movies (Fast and the Furious, Blue Brothers, Gone in Sixty Seconds, etc.) it doesn't even deserve mention.**************  Spoilers  *****************What really irks me are the incredibly fake driving sequences.  You don't need to know much about cars to know that you can't drive at freeway speeds in reverse, most care are geared even lower in reverse than in first. HEAVY duty swerving as seen in the opening race scenes can't be done at anything higher than 40 (try it sometime but don't sue me when you roll it or fishtail right off the road).  Star Wars type light speed effects don't happen at 80 miles an hour (or even 120) regardless of what you're dumping into your engine.  In the final scene you see the speed-o creep past 90, 100, 110, 120 all to barely eek past a boat that wouldn't be capable of speeds greater than 25 or so.  The one and only interesting stunt is the well done truck scene which is shown in it's entirety (yes, it's only about 10 seconds) during the previews.

I don't think this movie deserves to be called a sequel to "The Fast and the Furious",not because it is a bad movie,it is great and it does not fail to entertain most of the public,but for those who really liked the first one,this one is not a sequel.The first was very original,its conflicts were original,the movie was really about cars,and driving,and street racing,this one,in the other hand,presents us conflicts that we have seen for the last decades,the police couple that don't like each other,and at the end of the movie they finish kissing and hugging each other,the guy that falls in love with a woman that could make him fail his mission,the guy that has a drug empire in Miami,and pretends to become more powerful,the police that's trying to stop him,this are most of the conflicts we see in this movie,and we have seen in other movies,so it's not original.The Fast and the Furious was very original with great conflicts,it wasn't as fun as "its sequel",but it was awesome as well.But I think that this is the reason why this movie was released in the summer,to make critics say "well,is not original it has some cars stunts that are hard to believe,but is a summer movie,what the hell".I also did not like the decision of the director of making the movie in Miami because usually the backgrounds of street racing are nocturnes,Miami is usually more popular on daylight,street racing is usually on high ways in big cities like New York or Los Angeles,but it is clear that the director was just trying to make the movie more attractive to the summer-movie lovers because a lot of people identifies Miami with summer.This movie is more like a cop movie than a street racing movie,you can notice how hard is for the writers to make a space for races,and how easy is for the writers to find space for those things that usually a cop has to deal with.Is not a bad movie,but it is not original,and it cant be called a sequel.

2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)** 1/2 (out of 4)Sequel to THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS has former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) pulled back into the game when he's asked to go undercover and link a drug dealer to some flowing cash. O'Conner brings in his buddy Roman (Tyrese Gibson) as the two try to bring down the drug dealer so that their records will be cleared. I think it's safe to say that John Singleton is pretty much above this type of material and I think his inexperience in the genre somewhat hurts the picture. There's no question that the man knows how to tell a story and I think he does a great job with just about everything in the picture except for the car races and stunts. The one area where this sequel is really lacking is in regards to the races because they all look rather poor. A lot of this can be blamed on how they're shot and I also wasn't too impressed with the editing during these scenes. It really did seem as if they didn't film anything in a good way so they had to cover it up with the editing. Another bad thing is when the cars hit their "turbo" we're given some very bad effects with all the scenery getting blurry. This here just doesn't work. The rest of the film I thought was pretty good as we're given characters we like and there's no question that there's plenty of eye candy at work. Walker and Gibson are both good in their parts as they share some nice chemistry and both manage to play it cool. Eva Mendes doesn't get too much to do except try out a good looking bikini, which I'm sure will be enough for most. The rest of the supporting players are good in their parts including Cole Hauser as the bad guy as Ludicrous as a racing buddy. At just 108-minutes the film never overstays its welcome and director Singleton at least keeps the film moving at a nice pace. The story itself is downright idiotic but this is a popcorn movie after all so it's not that big of a deal.

Clearly many viewers were expecting 2 Fast 2 Furious to double up on the original. But without all the same cast members, it's hard to meet that level of expectation. Brian is back in the racing scene and has earned his own street credit, with moves that are just as smooth as his first ride. However, it doesn't take long for the FBI to reel the ex-cop back into the law to help bring down a Miami drug exporter. Being a two-man job, Brian insists that Roman join the crew - a childhood friend and 'criminal' that wants to clear his record. What follows the reunion is a good film with action-packed car chases, sexy actors and great suspense.Having watched all of the following Fast and Furious movies, it's important to have these two characters introduced early on. Most of you will agree with me saying, that the sequel is more laid back and doesn't take itself too seriously. I enjoyed the street racing, the narrative progression and amusing dialogue, particularly Roman's observations.2 Fast 2 Furious is the kind of racing film you should see.

I thought the first Fast and the Furious was alright, their was actually a plot to it and it was fun to watch.  This piece of junk on the other hand practically stole many things from other movies and was a complete waste of my time. The casting was terrible and the script was a joke.  This utter crap makes the Fast and the Furious look like a masterpiece destined to be a classic.  Everyone should sign a petition so their will not be a 3rd.  The idea of a second movie was alright, the turnout was terrible!  0 out of 5, I want my 2 hours $7.00 back along with a lot more to make up for the nausia, headaces, and suffering this discrace of a film gave me!!! I beg anyone out there not to waste their money or time.

2 Fast 2 Furious is the second film in the long running car-based action series (if you look very carefully, you'll see that the number '2' replaces the word 'Too' in the title! Clever that!). It's essentially the same cocktail of hot motors, hot girls, hot guys and hot locations as before, but with no Vin Diesel, his character having driven over the horizon at the end of the first film (only to return later in the series, once the actor had lowered his asking price).Instead, star Paul Walker—reprising his role as cop turned street-racer Brian O'Connor—is teamed up with Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, a criminal given the chance to wipe his record clean if he helps the FBI bust crime boss Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). With help from lovely Latino undercover agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and their super cool street-racer homies (who include rapper Ludicrous as garage owner Tej and model Devon Aoki as sexy driver Suki), Brian and Roman successfully outmanoeuvre the bad guys (and the feds) at every turn.Director John Singleton does a pretty good job handling the action, utilising all sorts of whizzy camera trickery and CGI effects to allow the camera to sweep from one driver to another during the high-speed racing scenes; it's technically impressive stuff that makes up somewhat for the extremely predictable plot and clichéd characters. Some of the stunts are extremely silly—a jump over a raised bridge that sees Walker leap his vehicle over his opponent's car takes the biscuit—but for a film that is all about excess, it all seems very apt and does little to spoil one's enjoyment.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.

I watched this because my friend offered to pay for me, and we had some time to burn. So off i went skulking about the fact i would have to sit a watch a plotless film about cars (ooooooww! The excitment is too much).I really really wished my friend had lost his wallet and could not have afforded the tickets, as this has to be possibly one of the worst films to grace the big screen. I have heared rumours that computer programmes have been created that write scripts. After watching this film i actually believe this. I seen porn films with better dialogue.The car chases were average at best. I honestly cannot be bothered to sit and abuse this film further. So i will simply end by saying this; if you have a brain, avoid this film.

I much preferred this one to the "original".  The first movie was basically Point Break in cars !! At least this one is stealing story lines from a few movies - bond, XXX, etc. Paul Walker really needs to quit his attempts at a moustache in these movies, it really just looks daft.  He looks like someone desperately trying to get facial hair and failing miserably. That said - he does a much better job in this movie than the first. Do not go to this film expecting it to be deep and meaningful, but just for fun.  Excellent cars - especially liked the scene where the car switch was pulled... Good movie as long as you're not expecting much!

I'm car nut at heart, and I remember how I look forward to the release of "The Fast and The Furious" two years ago. Finally a movie target towards us with a slightly higher passion for cars then the average Joe, I thought. So I was very disapointed to find that the movie had a silly storyline and was all about dumb kids with a fancy for neon lights and big spoilers. The racing scenes had nothing to do with racing, at least not the kind of racing we have in this world.The sequel is even worse - 3400 hp cars with afterburnes, an endless amount of gears and the ability to fly faster than the Star Trek Voyager (the scenery actually blurs as the cars go into warp mode). It's like watching the replay from some sience fiction game on a Playstation.If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother to.

2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) is highly underrated Entertained solid decent action flick for a sequel. I am a Paul Walker Fan and I just love him and his character Brian O'Conner former L.A. Police Officer. So I don't care what anyone says because absence without Vin Diesel was terrible. Well is not! Paul Walker plays all alone so he is awesome star. Leave this film alone it is pretty good and in my opinion is pretty much better than The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and Furious Seven (2015). You have Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, James Remar, Cole Hauser, Eva Mendes and Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins who reprise his role from the first installment in here. I love this film not as much as I love Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Fast Five (2011), The Fast & The Furious (2001) and Fast & Furious (2009). John Singleton did an excellent job directing this action packed sequel flick."All right, let's see what this thing can do." 'The adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that began with The Fast and the Furious takes an explosive new turn in 2 Fast 2 Furious! It's the nitro-fueled answer to the question: how fast do you like it? Now an ex-cop on the run, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) hooks into outlaw street-racing. When the Feds strong-arm him back, O'Connor's no rules, win-or-die skills are unleashed against an international drug lord. With his velocity-addicted buddy (Tyrese Gibson) riding shotgun, and a drop-dead-gorgeous undercover agent (Eva Mendes) dialing up the heat, 2 Fast 2 Furious accelerates the action into a desperate race for survival, justice... and mind-blowing, jaw-dropping speed!'I love this movie and the racing damn good and i like Chris Bridges because he isn't like Ice Cube or others rappers that are actors talking like yo whats up dogg. Ludicrous talks proper English. I thought that the movie was incredible! The street racing scenes were very realistic and Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson are a perfect pair for the movie. 5 stars out of 5!! Tokyo Drift was not as good as 2 fast 2 furious, but still good. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Is not a bad film it is actually a good film. I still can't believe why people criticized and bash this film so much. Gosh it is the last film in the series I like and I think is better than Tokyo Drift or Furious 7. Former cop Brian O'Conner is called upon to bust a dangerous criminal and he recruits the help of a former Miami street racer who has a chance to redeem himself. This film is set in Miami not in L.A. and Devon Aoki did a wonderful job as beautiful and sexy street racer Suki! Eva Mendes was gorgeous and sexy as Agent Monica Fuentes, she was so good at acting that even viewer is guessing if Monica is compromised and a dirty agent. Call it what you want I love this film and I think is the last good film of the franchise!Former Cop Brian O'Conner who teams up with his ex-con pal Roman Pearce to transport a shipment of 'dirty' money for shady Miami-based import-export dealer Carter Verone while actually working with undercover agent Monica Fuentes to bring Verone down. Brian O'Conner has left L.A. due to illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami taking money here and there by street racing. Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes , Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barstow, California where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With help Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone. This film was never about cars but it was about taking a crime lord down who is actually smuggling dirty laundry money with fast cars. Here we finally get to met Roman Pearce for the first time. We get to know more about Brian's background. We finally get to know why Brian let go Dom (Vin Diesel) in the first film. The Action sequences and fast cars are also great, so I don't know what is the problem at all?! 2 Fast 2 Furious is a 2003 American action film directed by John Singleton. It is the second installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) teams up with his ex-con friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and works with undercover U.S. Customs Service agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) to bring Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) down.The rating I am giving to this film is 7. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that are getting high scores.)7/10 Score: B Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, James Remar Director: John Singleton Producer: Neal H. Moritz Screenplay: Michael Brandt, Derek Haas Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 47 Mins. Budget: $76.000.000Box Office: $127,154,901

Very entertaining. Some cool new ideas with the cars and the racing. Story is not nearly as good as the first one, but has a bunch of cool action scenes. Some stuff you can laugh at with the dialogue but I didn't mind "breh"Brian: "i said forget about it cuh" rofl rofl rofl i watched that part 20 times (about 4 viewings, 6/17/2021)

I won't even dignify this cinematic atrocity with any sort of movie bashing review... it's simply not worth my time. The one redeeming quality that this movie had was the plain and simple fact that the incredibly bad attributes provided for a hilarious experience. Sitting through this movie, I must have asked myself 3o times if the producers/directors/cast were serious when they were filming. By the time you get to the scene with the car ejection, if you aren't laughing hysterically or haven't turned it off, then you should not be a member of IMDb. This final comment is to complete my ten line requirement because this movie is so bad I can't even comment any more on it or I will throw up in my mouth.

Before I start about anything. I was little disappointed with this movie. So second movie of The Fast and the Furious franchise didn't full my expectations. Brian is the only one of the main characters who stays in this film from the last film crew. The plot get little bit more action then the last movie so they filled up that part. They put the bad guy, so it gets some action. You still got some badass cars, but it is not about tuning this time. Races from 1/4 of a mile sprint now evolve into circuit races and highway chasing and running from police. The film is mainly about undercover mission to catch that bad guys similar to the last movie, but I miss that there is no one else from the old crew. Still this movie deserve 7, and current rate is underrated. Watch this movie, it won't have much roll into plot in later movie, don't have high expectations and you will like it. It is still worth seeing.

What made the first "The Fast and the Furious" movie attracted fans besides the bad ass cars and competition on the streets was Vin Diesel's appearance as Dominic Toretta, a hotshot race driver who makes his money racing others in the streets; he was a rising star on the fame after doing such flicks such as "Saving Private Ryan", "The Iron Giant" and later doing "XXX".At the end of the first movie, Vin's character Dominic flees away to Mexico where he wouldn't be in this sequel.No matter, the series continues on."2 Fast 2 Furious" has Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Conner, the one time agent who betrayed the enforcement agency by letting Dominic get away, is now a fugitive and being in a race competitions every night to make money. After being captured by the police, Brian is given a choice in either going to jail or helped the people he once work for in taking down a drug cartel dealer (Cole Hauser). Brian agrees under one condition that he gets his childhood friend Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson, Transformers) involved since he's into cars and knows his ways around tough people. They're also given an ally, the sexy Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) who's not only an undercover agent but also posing as the enemy's mistress. Time will tell when all will be revealed."2 Fast 2 Furious" is directed by John Singleton of Boyz in the Hood fame where he manages to bring the same energy and high expectations of the first movie. There's more cars, more chase sequences, more babes and more cameos this time around with a high octane pace.Overall, it's good.

With the help of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's chemistry and some intense racing scenes, Rob Cohen's The Fast and the Furious (2001) was an instant hit among racing fans. And like most franchises with critical financial success, a sequel started to be put into the works. Similar to many other sequels, it was distributed two years later and it's difficult to say whether it pleased fans as much as the first one did. According to this site, this is lowest score the franchise has. It wasn't bad at all but it was missing a few elements of the first movie, which left a more entertaining feeling.The story follows ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) back to Miami from Los Angeles where he's enjoying his time racing street cars only to be pulled back by the authorities that he dropped. Heading the authorities is Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) from the first installment and this time he wants O'Conner back one more time to take down a drug lord. And O'Conner can't refuse because he'd go to jail if he didn't accept. Plus, if the drug lord is turned in, all of his criminal charges will disappear. Why does this plot sound like Vin Diesel's xXx (2002) plot line (except it doesn't deal with a drug lord)? Speaking of which, why didn't Vin Diesel return? That's one thing that this franchise consistently needs. Paul Walker is the central character but Vin Diesel's presence was the icing on the cake.Is was nice though that the writers kept the continuity together. The characters do reference material from the first film which shows the producers want to keep the story going and not divert completely from the original. But if there's one thing that comes into question, it is the concept of getting caught having a love interest in the business. This happened in the first movie and it blew O'Conners cover. Here the same thing happens in a similar way. You'd think the lesson was learned. Sigh. The new interest is Eva Mendes and she plays her character well enough. Accompanying O'Conner is Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) an old friend who originally has a grudge for some of his own issues. Even with this though, their chemistry works well.Playing the drug lord is another interesting actor - Cole Hauser. He has a very smooth deep voice and resembles a very young Tom Berenger. He's also able to make his character seem dangerous enough to hurt someone. That's it for characters. The music produced by David Arnold of Stargate (1994) sounded better than BT's score from the first film but it wasn't evident enough. Barely heard a thing. As for action scenes, the racing is still fast paced and contains much of the same film making as the first, which kept the feeling the same. Other than that, the story feels the same as before but without Vin Diesel. It's not a bad follow up to the first movie, but not casting Vin Diesel wasn't smart - it's like missing a piece to a puzzle. Other than that, it's still a decent watch with better music and well-staged action sequences.

This film brings back more of what we loved from the first film with all the cars, girls, and action and multiplies it. However it is still inferior to the first film but that dosen't mean it isn't awesome. This movie has gotten a lot of criticism and i don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie. Some people complained about the lack of plot and the casts acting skills but I don't care about that. I watch these Fast films to be entertained and I was throughly entertained with this one. Even though it dosen't match up to the original it still excels in excitement. I mean how could you go wrong with taking the series to Miami were our eyes will be blessed with dozens of beautiful beach girls. And the races in this movie are also very exciting to. And let's not forget the awesome chase sequence in the film as well. Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson make a great team and show us why this movie is so cool. I still love this movie despite the many negative reviews I've seen and to all the haters I say forget about the plot and just enjoy the perks. This movie is made for entertainment not Oscar awards and as far as entertainment goes It was grade A popcorn style.

The cars, the stunts and the eye candy (Eva Mendes) are better than the first. But unlike the first, 2 Fast 2 Furious still boasts a lacklustre plot. Nevertheless, it's a great "bro" movie for the guys. The partnership between Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is amusing and works well as they team up and do next to impossible driving stunts with each other. The slight romance between Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and Brian O'Connor is predictable, but it's not to the same extent as the first one - just a bit of flirtation but not to the extent of a full fledged relationship. The Miami backdrop adds to the "upgrade" feel of the second movie in the Fast & Furious franchise. Flashy and full of action is 2 Fast, 2 Furious.

Undoubtedly this sequel suffers from the absence of Dom and the Toretto clan, but it still makes for a very enjoyable ride.The plot is a little bit derivative of the first, following Brian on an undercover op, but it is a pretty fun story nonetheless.We get to meet new characters Tej and Roman, who grow to become franchise regulars, and their introductions are very solid.The direction is fairly slick. Some of the awkward choppy camera shots and whiplash inducing cuts remain, but there's plenty of impressive camera work in here too.What I really enjoyed about this film though was the general tone. It is energetic and sleek and despite its flaws always carries a certain amount of charm and appeal.

Lordy Lord! Another crap sequel from the Hollywood stable of rubbish rehashes. I had low expectations of this movie....it doesn't have Vin Diesel in it for a start. But what I got was a collection of wooden actors and cheesy lines, interspersed with "race" sequences that made me laugh a lot. I should have realised it was going to be dire literally from the get-go. The Universal logo mutates into a chrome-plated wheel in the most irritatingly ludicrous manner. Spoilers ahead.So what is so horrible about this film? For a start the acting sucks worse than a Dyson. The opening race meet scene had me cringing in my seat, hoping it would get better. It didn't. Then there's the plot, or lack of one. Let's rehash the first film and nobody'll notice. Bah!The scripting is awful. The hero's buddy (name escapes me due to disinterest) actually steals something from a supposed drug-baron (again not sure if he was a drug-baron, was fighting the urge to read the paper at the time) whilst the latter is offering him a job. Come on! That makes about as much sense as ....well....nothing! You just would not do that, unless you were the world's most retarded individual. Sadly, his character survives the movie. Then there's the villain's two goons, who come across as stereotypical thick grunts who haven't had an original thought between them for years. Tiresomely predictable.The cars all look like they've escaped from a Scalextric set, with the exception of the hero's racer, which has had the "mobile tanning salon" upgrade. Damn, but he's gonna get skin cancer and cattaracts if he continues to drive that! Then you have to wonder just what sort of engine can accelerate a car from 0-80 in gasp!, only 20 seconds! Such speed! G-Forces pulling.....can't continue.....review.....must hit....brake! Yep, I could take my old Vauxhall Vectra out and give these machines a run for their money! Twenty seconds....sheeeshh!The crowning hilarity regarding the race scenes was that a) the cars apparently needed nitrous to reach 100mph, and b) When they hit the nitro the cars went into hyperspace. I'm serious! Everything blurred and streaked past. Everytime it happened I kept expecting to see Chewbacca pop up from the back, waving a wrench and going "Whoooaarrhg!" Give me a break!  I have to say this had me in stitches every time it happened but I'm surprised they didn't resort to burning tire-tracks a la Back to the Future as well. So lame.Another annoying fact is that Hollywood seems to think that 80mph is fast and 100mph only reachable by real racer types. Obviously they've never been on any British motorway. And our hero clocked 150mph in his death-defying leap off a bridge. It would all perhaps seem more impressive than it was, if the streets were narrower, or you actually cared about any of the characters. Or that a motorcyclist wasn't clocked on the M1 doing 157 mph. And he didn't even have R2D2 on the back, much less Chewie.So, underwhelmed would be the best word to sum up this film. The racing isn't exciting, the acting is bad and the plot is some Miami Vice reworking with incredulous bits thrown in for bad measure. All in all, a better name for this film might have been "The Dull and the Repetitive"

Without the assistance of a fugitive on the run Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who is AWOL here), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who's still a marked man with the FBI leaves Los Angeles and travels around the USA to compete in drag races and making new friends along the way as well as a substantial amount of money. It wasn't before long that the cops found his car and now he has to travels by foot. Until a lady drops him off at a car lot and his money he purchases a blue car and paints it silver. O'Connor ventures off to Miami where he reunites with ex-con Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) as they join forces with the FBI to track down a shady dealer named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), but only in exchange if they erase his criminal records. They are also joined by Secret Agent Monica Fuentes to bring this sleazy miscreant to justice.Unlike a lot of sequels where they don't measure up to the first instalments "2 Fast 2 Furious" succeeds in equalling up to the first instalment to maybe even being better (even without Vin Diesel). This movie like the first film is loaded with all the usual formulaic by-the-numbers mixed bag of clichés like the token slimy gangster and his dim-witted gang of goons, corrupt cops, by-the-book FBI agent and his determined sidekick and whatnot. But people who see this movie aren't here to see that. Hell no! We've come to see exciting drag races, cars crashing into each other, fight scenes, over-the-top humour (not Shakespaere), epic fights and most of all cool cars and hot girls.With Vin Diesel out of the picture, Paul Walker takes the central role as Brian O'Connor an former LAPD on the run and locating himself in Miami to capture a sleazy dealer in exchange that for his criminal charges to be eradicated. And he turns in a wonderful performance, even though it just feels at time forced, but in a funny way. Why funny? Because he just seems a bit to old to be talking like the way he does. His dialogue makes him sound like an adolescent who's been living in the basement of an LA public school and has picked up on their lingo. Roman Pearce (Gibson) is O'Connor's sidekick is no Dominic Toretto is still a capable replacement and has just as much charisma to pull it off.This movie is no different than the Land of Make Believe. It doesn't exist. It's all surreal. It's the threshold where the bad-assed dudes hang out, where drag racing is a pastime and not an illegality. Where the ladies let it loose and enjoy every moment of it. This utopia has our two heroes who constantly bicker like two teens arguing over who's pizza slice is bigger. In a world like this, there are no real good guys, and the badder you are, the greater your odds at survivor are in your favour. In action films this has been a common trend since Jason Statham starring in "The Transporter" as he played a hero who was a lackey for the underworld. These days, being a cookie-cutter hero is obsolete, it's a fight between bad guys and even more bad guys. O'Connor and Pearce confiscate drug money, but they take it before the cops grab their hands on the dough. It makes you wondering if the producers know who's coming to see this film or maybe not. It may feel at times like they're glorifying the audience watching it giving the impression those watching it are dumber than rocks.But once the smoke is cleared the real stars are the awesome cars. They grind, they release steam and most of all, they make a lot of noise that it's not too late to purchase some earplugs. The opening drag race will likely have your heart beating faster than a thousand bees in a hive. Vin Diesel was not the only one who departed as Rob Cohen took an exodus as John Singleton took over the director's chair which is quite surprising since Singleton back in 1991 directed the ever so powerful drama "Boyz in the Hood". What happened? I guess under a more competent director should come to no fluke that this film is 5x better than the first instalment.We know that the target audience was intended for the teen male audience between the ages of 15-20 years old. Their girlfriends knew what was coming to them when they joined them in this atmosphere and quite frankly, we never outgrow these kind of movies. Fast cars, exciting action and hot babes, what more do you need?

2 Fast 2 Furious lives up to its title and delivers some very cool scenes. Brian O'Connor {Paul Walker}, now a disgraced cop, fell victim to it--and now he's paying the price. As far as his bosses and the FBI brass are concerned, the hothead undercover officer threw one of their largest investigations ever. After losing his badge and any chance of redemption along with it, O'Connor is given one last chance when the feds in Miami need his help to collar Carter Verone, a flashy businessman whose using his import/export business as a cover for an international money laundering cartel. Brian isn't alone though as he has his old friend Roman Pearce {Tyrese} and undercover agent Monica Fuentes{ Eva Mendes} to help him out. The plot may sound bad and if you can't look past it then this isn't the film for you. This film is only worth watching if there are exciting action scenes. For the most part, the film doesn't disappoint in that category but the rest of the film isn't very strong. The acting is bad, worse then the original even. Paul Walker doesn't have enough charisma to be a lead and he also doesn't have much talent. Eva Mendes does an okay job and she is probably the best actress in this film. Tyrese should stick to modeling as his acting is very poor. Ludicrous may have top billing but he isn't in the film very much. Cole Hauser does an average job of playing a bad guy. He isn't about to set the world on fire but his performance isn't terrible either. John Singleton directs and does a better job then Rob Cohen did yet the film is still lacking in a good story. 2 Fast 2 Furious is a sequel in the loosest definition of the word. Only one star returns, there's a new director, actors, producers etc. It doesn't really matter though as the cars are the real stars. The cars in this film are pretty cool and look really nice. This film is of course very unrealistic as some of the stunts break the laws of gravity. The running time is 107 minutes though sometimes the film seems longer. A lot of people were complaining that Vin wasn't in this one. I'm kind of glad though as he wasn't that impressive in the original. Is this one better then the original? I liked it more as it wasn't as boring as the original. In the end, this film has plenty of action to deliver but not much in the story or the acting which brings it down. Rating 6/10, above average action flick.

It's not as good as the first and repeats the first film's plot but 2 Fast 2 Furious is still fun due to great performances from Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson and their great chemistry. The enjoyable and over the top action helps as well.

2 Fast 2 Furious: 5/10: Okay so it's car porn. It's rather well done car porn. Stunningly brainless but rather fun in places 2 Fast 2 Furious gives us a candy colored version of street racing with a plot that is best not even discussed. After all you don't watch this for the plot. You watch it for the cars. A giant product placement for Mitsubishi among others the cars and characters are right out of a video game (the paint jobs match the personalities) and kudos to the filmmakers for keeping the CGI to a minimum. The movie made me want to trick out my old Dodge Dart.(Electric Blue paint job with matching neon on yeah baby). Director John Singletary moves the cars around like he has been directing Burt Reynolds's movies all his life. (This is not a criticism and the fact he avoids Cannonball Run style humor is another plus.) Singletary who usually films much more important movies, (what's next Scorsese's Jaws 5 or Spike Lee's Ella Enchanted 2 Ella in Da Hood? Actually the way some of Spike's recent films have gone this may not be a bad idea) keeps the pace tight and the actors attractive.However all is not peachy keen. For example I haven't seen African American hairstyles this bad since Cotton came to Harlem. The Tyrese character comes across as a complete idiot almost sinking the movie once or twice. (Now I know Tyrese can act I saw Baby Boy.) Another quick note I have driven cars with nitrous oxide and they give you a burst of acceleration not warp speed effects from Star Trek. (And lets face it the Mitishibishi cars are pretty but not fast. These cars are dragging down a strip after a minute and the speedometer finally moves from 90 to 120 my Dart has better acceleration after 60 sixty seconds.The movie, to its credit, acknowledges when the cars get whooped by some old American muscle. I know I promised not to discuss the plot but one thing. If you needed someone to drive a couple of million dollars from Miami to Key West (all of 2 hours on Interstate 95 and Route 1), would you A: hire and old couple in a RV B: Drive it yourself or C: Hire two ex-cons in the flashiest cars you have ever seen and who had to this point been incapable of rounding the block without causing an accident and attracting various state and local agencies. I guess that's why we are not criminal masterminds.

So much greatness in this film I'm shocked it's got a 5.9 rating! John Singleton directed such a wild ride of fun entertainment with the cars, music, neon lights, cinematography, popcorn lines that are loved and engaging story. The characters have the perfect energy; I get such a jolly vibe from 2 Fast 2 Furious every time I see it!

This film is more of an action comedy then an action which the first film was. This film is about Brian O' Conner who goes back to fighting crime with his buddy Roman Pearce and secret agent Monica Fuentes to bring down the notorious criminal Carter Verone. What I think people don't get about this film is unlike the first, this film is just plain out in good 'ol fun. This is definitely not meant not to be serious at any level. I would think people could tell just by how the actors play their characters. The acting is very good because you can see that the actors are having fun doing this flick to make it an actual fun movie. Even though it is a fun film, the action scenes are great. Like when the car flies onto that boat; I thought that was awesome!!This film is like a mix of "Hollywood Homicide" and "The French Connection"Overall I think this is a great little afternoon sit on the couch on a sunny day and leave the screen door open movie.My take: 10/10

Having seen and enjoyed the first movie I had moderate hope for this one but it looks like yet another sequel that should never have been made.  It's impossible to know just how bad the acting was as dialog was contrived and uncomfortable and probably wouldn't have sounded natural from even the best speakers.  However, bad acting is bad acting and this was certainly about as bad as it comes.  The one exception to this was ludacris who was suprisingly enjoyable while on screen but those times were too short and too far between.  All of this could easily have been forgiven though if the action measured up.  After all, this isn't hamlet right?  Unfortunately "2 fast" fell short here as well unless one likes seeing gear shifts, speed-o needles, and mechanically impossible driving sequences.  In the year of the matrix, the hulk, and later return of the king this one simply wont measure up to it's competition and in the lexicon of exciting driving movies (Fast and the Furious, Blue Brothers, Gone in Sixty Seconds, etc.) it doesn't even deserve mention.**************  Spoilers  *****************What really irks me are the incredibly fake driving sequences.  You don't need to know much about cars to know that you can't drive at freeway speeds in reverse, most care are geared even lower in reverse than in first. HEAVY duty swerving as seen in the opening race scenes can't be done at anything higher than 40 (try it sometime but don't sue me when you roll it or fishtail right off the road).  Star Wars type light speed effects don't happen at 80 miles an hour (or even 120) regardless of what you're dumping into your engine.  In the final scene you see the speed-o creep past 90, 100, 110, 120 all to barely eek past a boat that wouldn't be capable of speeds greater than 25 or so.  The one and only interesting stunt is the well done truck scene which is shown in it's entirety (yes, it's only about 10 seconds) during the previews.

I don't think this movie deserves to be called a sequel to "The Fast and the Furious",not because it is a bad movie,it is great and it does not fail to entertain most of the public,but for those who really liked the first one,this one is not a sequel.The first was very original,its conflicts were original,the movie was really about cars,and driving,and street racing,this one,in the other hand,presents us conflicts that we have seen for the last decades,the police couple that don't like each other,and at the end of the movie they finish kissing and hugging each other,the guy that falls in love with a woman that could make him fail his mission,the guy that has a drug empire in Miami,and pretends to become more powerful,the police that's trying to stop him,this are most of the conflicts we see in this movie,and we have seen in other movies,so it's not original.The Fast and the Furious was very original with great conflicts,it wasn't as fun as "its sequel",but it was awesome as well.But I think that this is the reason why this movie was released in the summer,to make critics say "well,is not original it has some cars stunts that are hard to believe,but is a summer movie,what the hell".I also did not like the decision of the director of making the movie in Miami because usually the backgrounds of street racing are nocturnes,Miami is usually more popular on daylight,street racing is usually on high ways in big cities like New York or Los Angeles,but it is clear that the director was just trying to make the movie more attractive to the summer-movie lovers because a lot of people identifies Miami with summer.This movie is more like a cop movie than a street racing movie,you can notice how hard is for the writers to make a space for races,and how easy is for the writers to find space for those things that usually a cop has to deal with.Is not a bad movie,but it is not original,and it cant be called a sequel.

2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)** 1/2 (out of 4)Sequel to THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS has former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) pulled back into the game when he's asked to go undercover and link a drug dealer to some flowing cash. O'Conner brings in his buddy Roman (Tyrese Gibson) as the two try to bring down the drug dealer so that their records will be cleared. I think it's safe to say that John Singleton is pretty much above this type of material and I think his inexperience in the genre somewhat hurts the picture. There's no question that the man knows how to tell a story and I think he does a great job with just about everything in the picture except for the car races and stunts. The one area where this sequel is really lacking is in regards to the races because they all look rather poor. A lot of this can be blamed on how they're shot and I also wasn't too impressed with the editing during these scenes. It really did seem as if they didn't film anything in a good way so they had to cover it up with the editing. Another bad thing is when the cars hit their "turbo" we're given some very bad effects with all the scenery getting blurry. This here just doesn't work. The rest of the film I thought was pretty good as we're given characters we like and there's no question that there's plenty of eye candy at work. Walker and Gibson are both good in their parts as they share some nice chemistry and both manage to play it cool. Eva Mendes doesn't get too much to do except try out a good looking bikini, which I'm sure will be enough for most. The rest of the supporting players are good in their parts including Cole Hauser as the bad guy as Ludicrous as a racing buddy. At just 108-minutes the film never overstays its welcome and director Singleton at least keeps the film moving at a nice pace. The story itself is downright idiotic but this is a popcorn movie after all so it's not that big of a deal.

Clearly many viewers were expecting 2 Fast 2 Furious to double up on the original. But without all the same cast members, it's hard to meet that level of expectation. Brian is back in the racing scene and has earned his own street credit, with moves that are just as smooth as his first ride. However, it doesn't take long for the FBI to reel the ex-cop back into the law to help bring down a Miami drug exporter. Being a two-man job, Brian insists that Roman join the crew - a childhood friend and 'criminal' that wants to clear his record. What follows the reunion is a good film with action-packed car chases, sexy actors and great suspense.Having watched all of the following Fast and Furious movies, it's important to have these two characters introduced early on. Most of you will agree with me saying, that the sequel is more laid back and doesn't take itself too seriously. I enjoyed the street racing, the narrative progression and amusing dialogue, particularly Roman's observations.2 Fast 2 Furious is the kind of racing film you should see.

I thought the first Fast and the Furious was alright, their was actually a plot to it and it was fun to watch.  This piece of junk on the other hand practically stole many things from other movies and was a complete waste of my time. The casting was terrible and the script was a joke.  This utter crap makes the Fast and the Furious look like a masterpiece destined to be a classic.  Everyone should sign a petition so their will not be a 3rd.  The idea of a second movie was alright, the turnout was terrible!  0 out of 5, I want my 2 hours $7.00 back along with a lot more to make up for the nausia, headaces, and suffering this discrace of a film gave me!!! I beg anyone out there not to waste their money or time.

2 Fast 2 Furious is the second film in the long running car-based action series (if you look very carefully, you'll see that the number '2' replaces the word 'Too' in the title! Clever that!). It's essentially the same cocktail of hot motors, hot girls, hot guys and hot locations as before, but with no Vin Diesel, his character having driven over the horizon at the end of the first film (only to return later in the series, once the actor had lowered his asking price).Instead, star Paul Walker—reprising his role as cop turned street-racer Brian O'Connor—is teamed up with Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, a criminal given the chance to wipe his record clean if he helps the FBI bust crime boss Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). With help from lovely Latino undercover agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and their super cool street-racer homies (who include rapper Ludicrous as garage owner Tej and model Devon Aoki as sexy driver Suki), Brian and Roman successfully outmanoeuvre the bad guys (and the feds) at every turn.Director John Singleton does a pretty good job handling the action, utilising all sorts of whizzy camera trickery and CGI effects to allow the camera to sweep from one driver to another during the high-speed racing scenes; it's technically impressive stuff that makes up somewhat for the extremely predictable plot and clichéd characters. Some of the stunts are extremely silly—a jump over a raised bridge that sees Walker leap his vehicle over his opponent's car takes the biscuit—but for a film that is all about excess, it all seems very apt and does little to spoil one's enjoyment.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.

I watched this because my friend offered to pay for me, and we had some time to burn. So off i went skulking about the fact i would have to sit a watch a plotless film about cars (ooooooww! The excitment is too much).I really really wished my friend had lost his wallet and could not have afforded the tickets, as this has to be possibly one of the worst films to grace the big screen. I have heared rumours that computer programmes have been created that write scripts. After watching this film i actually believe this. I seen porn films with better dialogue.The car chases were average at best. I honestly cannot be bothered to sit and abuse this film further. So i will simply end by saying this; if you have a brain, avoid this film.

I much preferred this one to the "original".  The first movie was basically Point Break in cars !! At least this one is stealing story lines from a few movies - bond, XXX, etc. Paul Walker really needs to quit his attempts at a moustache in these movies, it really just looks daft.  He looks like someone desperately trying to get facial hair and failing miserably. That said - he does a much better job in this movie than the first. Do not go to this film expecting it to be deep and meaningful, but just for fun.  Excellent cars - especially liked the scene where the car switch was pulled... Good movie as long as you're not expecting much!

I'm car nut at heart, and I remember how I look forward to the release of "The Fast and The Furious" two years ago. Finally a movie target towards us with a slightly higher passion for cars then the average Joe, I thought. So I was very disapointed to find that the movie had a silly storyline and was all about dumb kids with a fancy for neon lights and big spoilers. The racing scenes had nothing to do with racing, at least not the kind of racing we have in this world.The sequel is even worse - 3400 hp cars with afterburnes, an endless amount of gears and the ability to fly faster than the Star Trek Voyager (the scenery actually blurs as the cars go into warp mode). It's like watching the replay from some sience fiction game on a Playstation.If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother to.

2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) is highly underrated Entertained solid decent action flick for a sequel. I am a Paul Walker Fan and I just love him and his character Brian O'Conner former L.A. Police Officer. So I don't care what anyone says because absence without Vin Diesel was terrible. Well is not! Paul Walker plays all alone so he is awesome star. Leave this film alone it is pretty good and in my opinion is pretty much better than The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and Furious Seven (2015). You have Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, James Remar, Cole Hauser, Eva Mendes and Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins who reprise his role from the first installment in here. I love this film not as much as I love Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Fast Five (2011), The Fast & The Furious (2001) and Fast & Furious (2009). John Singleton did an excellent job directing this action packed sequel flick."All right, let's see what this thing can do." 'The adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that began with The Fast and the Furious takes an explosive new turn in 2 Fast 2 Furious! It's the nitro-fueled answer to the question: how fast do you like it? Now an ex-cop on the run, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) hooks into outlaw street-racing. When the Feds strong-arm him back, O'Connor's no rules, win-or-die skills are unleashed against an international drug lord. With his velocity-addicted buddy (Tyrese Gibson) riding shotgun, and a drop-dead-gorgeous undercover agent (Eva Mendes) dialing up the heat, 2 Fast 2 Furious accelerates the action into a desperate race for survival, justice... and mind-blowing, jaw-dropping speed!'I love this movie and the racing damn good and i like Chris Bridges because he isn't like Ice Cube or others rappers that are actors talking like yo whats up dogg. Ludicrous talks proper English. I thought that the movie was incredible! The street racing scenes were very realistic and Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson are a perfect pair for the movie. 5 stars out of 5!! Tokyo Drift was not as good as 2 fast 2 furious, but still good. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Is not a bad film it is actually a good film. I still can't believe why people criticized and bash this film so much. Gosh it is the last film in the series I like and I think is better than Tokyo Drift or Furious 7. Former cop Brian O'Conner is called upon to bust a dangerous criminal and he recruits the help of a former Miami street racer who has a chance to redeem himself. This film is set in Miami not in L.A. and Devon Aoki did a wonderful job as beautiful and sexy street racer Suki! Eva Mendes was gorgeous and sexy as Agent Monica Fuentes, she was so good at acting that even viewer is guessing if Monica is compromised and a dirty agent. Call it what you want I love this film and I think is the last good film of the franchise!Former Cop Brian O'Conner who teams up with his ex-con pal Roman Pearce to transport a shipment of 'dirty' money for shady Miami-based import-export dealer Carter Verone while actually working with undercover agent Monica Fuentes to bring Verone down. Brian O'Conner has left L.A. due to illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami taking money here and there by street racing. Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes , Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barstow, California where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With help Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone. This film was never about cars but it was about taking a crime lord down who is actually smuggling dirty laundry money with fast cars. Here we finally get to met Roman Pearce for the first time. We get to know more about Brian's background. We finally get to know why Brian let go Dom (Vin Diesel) in the first film. The Action sequences and fast cars are also great, so I don't know what is the problem at all?! 2 Fast 2 Furious is a 2003 American action film directed by John Singleton. It is the second installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) teams up with his ex-con friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and works with undercover U.S. Customs Service agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) to bring Miami-based drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) down.The rating I am giving to this film is 7. Anything below 7 would be ridiculous, if anyone would not say that this wasn't At least A GOOD ACTION FILM! (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that are getting high scores.)7/10 Score: B Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Paul Walker, Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, James Remar Director: John Singleton Producer: Neal H. Moritz Screenplay: Michael Brandt, Derek Haas Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 47 Mins. Budget: $76.000.000Box Office: $127,154,901

Very entertaining. Some cool new ideas with the cars and the racing. Story is not nearly as good as the first one, but has a bunch of cool action scenes. Some stuff you can laugh at with the dialogue but I didn't mind "breh"Brian: "i said forget about it cuh" rofl rofl rofl i watched that part 20 times (about 4 viewings, 6/17/2021)

I won't even dignify this cinematic atrocity with any sort of movie bashing review... it's simply not worth my time. The one redeeming quality that this movie had was the plain and simple fact that the incredibly bad attributes provided for a hilarious experience. Sitting through this movie, I must have asked myself 3o times if the producers/directors/cast were serious when they were filming. By the time you get to the scene with the car ejection, if you aren't laughing hysterically or haven't turned it off, then you should not be a member of IMDb. This final comment is to complete my ten line requirement because this movie is so bad I can't even comment any more on it or I will throw up in my mouth.
