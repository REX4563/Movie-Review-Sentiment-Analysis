Sometimes critics mistake.This is definitely an example.You see some movies don't need to be reviewed,you just need to watch them first,and then judge your feelings. So idea of the movie is great,and its pretty familiar to EVERY father on Christmas.And that's why people like to associate themselves with Arnie's character.There are a lot of misadventures(you wont remember every after ending i promise),but they actually work out pretty entertaining,sometimes even laughably funny (Santa's gang scene). Also contains good soundtrack,that includes Chuck Berry's "Run Rudolf,Run". i also like casting choice for Ted.I don't like this type of sleazy scumbags,thats why he is so realistically annoying.Not much else to say,WATCH IT NOW.

'Jingle All The Way' is a Christmas story about merchandising and family. A lot of people seemed to really hate this movie, but I did not think it was all that bad. Sure, some of the action and the story was not the best, but I thought it did provoke a lot of laughter. The scenes with Arnie at the warehouse filled with Santas and elves was funny, and it had a good ending with the father becoming the hero after all. It does represent the bad of the holiday season with all the merchandising and the over-emphasis on that one particular toy that kids must get for Christmas, and if they do not receive it, then they are outcasts. Despite its problems, I did find it a funny and worthwhile film.

This film shows the insanity of Christmas. Two parents, who waited untill the last minute to buy a popular gift for their child, spend all of Christmas Eve trying to come up with the toy. They were vicious and violent with each other in their efforts to secure the piece of plastic junk for their little darling. This picture shows just how goofy people act at this time of year. Instead of preparing, most folks wait till it is too late; all in the name of Christmas spirit. Arnold portrayed a man who ignored his boy all year, and then tried to buy his love at Christmas with a pitiful little bauble. How true of real life. A funny movie on one hand, a tragedy on the other. Look and learn.

This film has taken a great many knocks over the years and I'll be the first to admit that it does have flaws. The conclusion, especially, is so sickly sweet that it sends your eyes rolling like slot machine spinners. Some of the things that Arnie does as he gets more and more desperate to track down a Turbo man doll for his son are cringe-worthy (I'm thinking particularly of when he stalks a little girl in the ball room at the mall) but they ultimately do function within the larger scope of the film.Arnold plays a father who was supposed to take care of getting a toy for his son. He's forgotten and has to go out on Christmas Eve to try and track one down. When he realizes that it is the hottest selling toy of all-time, High-jinx ensue.The thing with Arnie is that you're either going to take him or leave him. If you find his accent aggravating, or his acting wooden, then stay away from this film because you're just not going to like it anyway. I don't think he's that bad in this and I would go so far as to say that it is probably his second most successful comedy ("Kindergarden Cop" being my first choice -- "IT'S NOT A TOOMAH!!!" CLassic! Ha!). He's got an excellent supporting cast in this one: Jim Belushi as a seedy shopping mall Santa, Rita Wilson as Arnie's long suffering wife, Phil Hartman as the sugary sweet sleaze of a neighbour and of course the inimitable Sinbad. I would argue that the unlikely pairing of Sinbad and Arnie works extremely well and is probably the key to the film's success. Neither really has the acting chops to make the other look bad or out of place and so they are each able to hold their own when on screen at the same time.There is a tendency to take this film too seriously. It has a great satirical viewpoint. Who among the retail warriors can watch this film and not throw their hands up in the air saying "Idiots! You've left it to the last minute and you're getting exactly what you deserve!" Who among the legion of over-stressed and unlucky parents can't feel some sympathy for the plight of a man just trying to do right by his kid, even if it is a little too late? Jingle All The Way is a Christmas cure. It's a sharp point to puncture the over commercialism we get caught up in. This film is a chance to chuckle at ourselves and the insanity we leap into with enthusiasm annually. It is a ninety minute reality check and a chance to sit back, relax, and not take things so seriously. This isn't 'Scrooged,' or 'It's a Wonderful Life,' or 'A Christmas Carol.' It isn't the best of comedies or the best of Christmas films. But it is very honest about itself and not a bad way to spend the holiday.

Watch it in the early '00 many times with my kids on a good old VHS. For them Jingle All the Way is now Nostalgia. Watch it again last week on tv and they still find it a funny movie.

For me 'Jingle All The Way' was unfairly panned by critics and is similarly overrated by general audiences who consider it to be the Christmas classic it is not.I think it has a strong premise about consumerism and the need for guilt ridden parents to buy their children's love. It delivers a plethora of crazy shenanigans en route to a fun climax. However, so much of the humour and character moments either irritate or do not work for me. I appreciate comedy is in the eye of the beholder so others may appreciate the humour more than me.I have always found Arnold Schwarzenegger to be an enigmatic personality. When you see him out of character being interviewed he can be incredibly charismatic and funny, yet when the cameras roll on a movie set he can be wooden and with little timing. 'Kindergarten Cop' worked better as he was a straight man to the children, but as Howard he struggles to play the clown. He is better at the more heartfelt family moments, but they feel somewhat forced at times.I find the antagonist character played by Sinbad pretty annoying and does not work in combination with Howard. Their banter, feels quite forced and awkwardly timed.The positives for me include the characters played by James Belushi and Phil Hartman, who lift the quality of their material with strong performances. I also like how outlandishly it shifts in tone as the story unfolds. This might be unintended, but when you take Howard from his rock bottom Grinch moment to his action packed Turboman finale in a matter of minutes you have to enjoy the ridiculousness for what it is.I think young Jake Lloyd struggles with some of the dialogue but do not blame him at all. With child actors the onus is on the script to be suitable and the director to draw out performances.

Satires are hard to come by. Good satires are much more rare. Satires that fooled everyone, from the audience to the actors playing in the film are toughest to find. Jingle All The Way achieves just that. By throwing a social commentary joke over the heads of audiences instead of into their minds, and then by delivering a biting message that stands just as true today as it did when it first came out, Jingle All The Way went from disappointment to one of the most realistic holiday films ever, despite its lack of realism. The hypocritical statements are flying in this first paragraph, but the truth is almost everyone missed the joke, the main picture. What looks like pure family fun turns into commentary with an attack on commercialism and the American public buying into the scheme. Even if you don't want to look into the deeper details, why skip out on Sinbad and The Terminator going at it?Jingle All The Way follows a workaholic dad by the name of Howard who disappoints his wife and son year after year. After missing another karate practice, Howard promises to not only show up at the parade the next day, but also get his son the TurboMan doll that is based off Jamie's favorite television show, favorite cereal, and favorite hero. The catch is simple: it is impossible to find the doll since it's a massive hit. Not only that, but most shipments are not arriving on Christmas Eve (notice the setting getting a bit dangerous), therefore increasing the supply-and-demand. Howard is still determined to find the doll and not disappoint again. Christmas Eve turns into D-Day on the shores of stores across the nation.This sort of idea has always been present in television shows everywhere, but to take a simple concept and stretch it into a full-length motion picture is a challenge to the utmost level. Thankfully, we have good writing by Randy Kornfield, decent direction by Brian Levant, and the supervision of Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter, Mrs. Doubtfire, Adventures in Babysitting). Looking past the seemingly heavy dosage of criticism against American society and Big Business, we see the cast throw our victim fathers into every possible awful and unfortunate scenario possible, and the range of ideas presented are amazing.Arnold Schwarzenegger must have a sense of humor, because he isn't afraid of embarrassing himself by getting beat up and pulverized by the holiday rush, a bitter mailman, and a Santa Claus that can scare blind children. His performance by no means is Oscar-worthy, but we see him with his determination like in his usual action films, but in a whole new arena, a totally different atmosphere, and that just adds a dosage of humor to the entire film. To see an action star have to claw his way out of a melee of people trying to get bouncy balls is priceless. Almost as rare as Schwarzenegger looking wimpy is Sinbad in a superb film. His performance as the disgruntled mailman just matches him perfectly, and his determination to get the doll is just as bad. Rounding out the cast is a bunch of underrated and/or B-list stars like the brilliant Phil Hartman, Rita Wilson, Robert Conrad, and James Belushi.Why in the world would anyone want to skip a movie in which we see a rumble involving an angry dad and a bunch of Santa Claus frauds running an illegal toy-manufacturing/distributing operation (Best scene of the movie for sure)? Why miss out on The Terminator take on a raging reindeer? Why skip out on a mailman posing as TurboMan's villain and flipping the bird to spectators during a family parade? With an endless amount of silly, over-the-top, brilliant moments in which represent Christmas at its truest, Jingle All The Way stands as the most realistic holiday movie ever, since it really shows what its all about. Forget the sappy messages you see in Christmas movies, it doesn't matter what you did, what illegal things you performed, how many assaults you have committed, as long as you get that gosh-darn toy for your child in Christmas, it will all be forgiven.Everything in this film, whether unintended or intentional, downplays the meaning of Christmas and all that goes on. There isn't a single decent Santa Claus in the film; they are all corrupt human beings with a different agenda. The stores are not trying to please anyone; they just want money for themselves and enjoy seeing people scrap for chances of earning a doll like starving dogs fighting over a hunk of meat. The main child doesn't say he wants his dad to stay home for Christmas, he says he wants a certain doll, and even recites the entire commercial, including the final words "Batteries Not Included." Nobody is helping each other; everyone is fighting, pushing people towards aisles and toy displays. While the entire thing is comical, it truly does happen in the real world. There was even one pivotal scene in which Byron the mailman discusses the importance of getting that special gift; he compares himself to another child that got the hot item on a certain year. Byron is disappointed, grows up to become a loser; neighbor that gets the doll becomes a multi-millionaire.Can a Christmas without material possessions scar you and turn you into a loser? Or is it Commercial America making it seem that way? Is this film a perfect satire or did it accidentally become that way? While the clues are pointing towards lampoon, Levant looks like he really aimed for the heartfelt, emotional Christmas movie with the bittersweet ending. Instead, we get a film that predates (and apparently predicts) the Tickle Me Elmo, Pokemon, Playstation, and Furby holiday horror stories. From the campy introduction to the hysterical final showdown, it's a great movie for what it is, and after aging like fine wine, becomes something moreaccidental or not.

''Jingle All the Way'' is a very cool movie I watched when I was 10 years old, and only watching it again so many years later, I recognize the boy who plays Jamie, to be the young Anakin Skywalker in the first movie! Anyway, I don't agree with the low rating of this movie, because it is a classic to watch in Christimas and I remember having much fun with it, even having some bizarre or impossible things happening in the story. (Let's not forget that it is a movie and the main goal is to have fun! And only now, I discover that the actor who played Ted in this movie,Phil Hartman,is dead..)In the story, Arnold is a busy father, who forgets to buy the toy his son wants for Christmas (Turbo man), and will be in the most ridiculous and funny situations to see if he have a chance to save Jamie's happiness.

I will keep this short and sweet...This is probably the worst movie that I ever seen in five years....The plot from the start is asinine but demonstrates the consumerist zombie American culture perfectly. You're telling me that in one of the largest cities in the world, you cant find one G.D toy? PLEASE! Then you have Sinbad playing this guy who wants the toy too for his kid, who also apparently can't find it in the same city, so he makes it his mission to get if from Schwarzenegger's character's kid...That's scummy enough...But to top it all off, the cherry on the ice cream, is at the end of the movie the kid actually hands the toy to Sinbad in some tacked-on phony sentimentality....I wanted to kill the kid! The only thing that was positive in this movie is Phil Hartman. He made the movie tolerable, but it was an infuriating waste of good talent. I cannot believe this movie even got a 5....Goes to show you how much the American collective intelligence has dropped!

If Arnold Schwarzenegger had not been the lead actor in Jingle All The Way, maybe I would've liked it more. He portrays his character in an awkward, out of place matter and sounds like he inspired Tommy Wiseau's voice in The Room. When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state.Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases.Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his "work is more important than family" attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure.The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House. You follow? Like Stephanie wants this gotta-have-it stuffed bear for Christmas, Jesse, Danny, and Joey try to obtain it on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth when it's out all across town. So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll.The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions.This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless. Maybe next year, Arnold might try his luck with Black Friday.Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, and Sinbad. Directed by: Brian Levant.

I didn't find anything worth laughing in the movie!it was completely boring,they had stretched the story for an hour and 30 minutes,with most of the time Howard roaming around to buy the action figure!The essence of a Christmas movies was lost,they have tried to come up with comedy,but it turned out to be really a bore.They could have come up with much more heart touching material,rather than a chase for a dumb toy.The role of Myron(played by Sinbad) wasn't pleasing,there was lack of humanity,it was cheap in a way.There was way too much exposure of low budget jokes!In a way it all seemed kiddish and annoying to watch.Well its an old movie cant complain more,its 2016,hopefully there wont be another Christmas movie like this to ruin the holiday!!

I thought this movie was not bad...a bit on the silly side but still humorous. The competition between Sinbad and Arnie was pretty funny and it's amusing to watch Arnold's performance in comedic roles. A nice Christmas flick for jokes.

Jingle all the Way (1996): Dir: Brian Levant / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sinbad, Rita Wilson, Phil Hartman, James Belushi: Perhaps the stupidest Christmas film imaginable. It had to be a real warped mind to conjure this garbage up. A man is stampeded by a group of immature adults seeking a Turbo Man action figure. This is obviously the Christmas version of lame action movies with violence toned down to Arnold Schwarzenegger clubbing a line of Santas with a giant candy cane. Directed by Brian Levant who was responsible for the horrible screen adaptation of The Flintstones. Well, he hits even lower notes here. Schwarzenegger and mail carrier Sinbad compete for the action figure in what can easily be described as career suicide for both. One particularly stupid scene at a radio station has Sinbad holding off police with a gift that he claims is a bomb. When it actually turns out to be a bomb, Sinbad asks, "What is the world coming to?" Perhaps the screenwriter can fill us in. In lame supporting roles are Rita Wilson as Schwarzenegger's wife and Phil Hartman as his womanizing neighbor who threatens to move in on Wilson. James Belushi plays a nasty mall Santa who candy cane battles Schwarzenegger and it is embarrassing to watch. The film so cheap that it should be wrapped in a trash bag in hopes that Santa will deliver it down the nearest chimney fire. Score: 0 / 10

Sinbad and Arnold are perfect in their comedy roles! Arnold as the dumb dad who waits until the last second to by a extremely popular toy called Turbo Man (a obvious poke at Power Rangers) for his son (played by Jake Lloyd, yes Anakin in Episode I). Meanwhile a zany Postman (played awesomely by Sinbad) is going for the toy as well. Racing through shopping malls, wringing each others necks, and even a fight for the toy in a radio studio "give-away" follows. Oh, and Phil Hartman is great as the OTHER DAD who has already bought the toy for his son and is tormenting Arnold about it. Great, just great!!! Downright hilarious the whole way through. Great true-to-life story about dumb fads like Beanie-Babies. Great fun for the holiday season, pick up "Jingle All The Way" Today!

As I reminisce my youth, I feel regret for having my parents go out and get me so many different toys. It was not as if I was a spoiled pain-in- the-butt but it was hard for them to keep up with what I was interested in. I went through a timeline of obsession with "Power Rangers", "Pokémon", "Digimon", and "Yu-Gi-Oh!" cards. I cannot imagine the sheer frustration my parents felt spending their hard-earned money on merchandise I would soon grow out of. I suppose my past has something to do with my sympathy for "Jingle All the Way" despite being a fairly bad movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Howard Langston, a hard-working salesman, who tries as hard as he can to spend time with his family especially his son, Jamie (played by child star Jake Lloyd). But every time Howard sees a great opportunity to fulfill his family duties, he encounters multiple set-backs whether it is traffic or the police. On Christmas Eve, Howard decides to make-up for all his troubles by buying his son an action figure of Turboman, a TV superhero beloved by children all over the world (He is nothing compared to my "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"). However, finding the most popular toy on the market during Christmas Eve proves futile. Howard is also forced to compete with another father, Myron Larabee (played by Sinbad), for Turboman. Throughout the day, Howard will face one problem after another on his quest to buy his son's Christmas present. As a comedy dependent on chaos and absurd behavior, "Jingle All The Way" offers fun but not enough intelligence. People run into boxes containing action figures and use toys to sabotage their competitors. In real life, the situation would be more mob-like and hazardous with shoving and occasional fist-fights. If the director (Brian Levant) wanted to make a point about Christmas commercialism, he should have made the last minute shopping much more realistic. Speaking of which, the people in "Jingle All the Way" are ridiculously easy to anger and they will react with cheesy lines ("I'm going to deck your halls") and violence. If you call me a conman, I simply shrug the name off, maybe laugh at you for being wrong. I am not going to hit anybody. Arnold gets into fights with everybody: a mall employee, Santa Clauses, midgets, giants, kids, parents, a cardboard stand, and even a reindeer that acts more like a dog. He is better off fighting a South American army than yelling at a neighbor for eating his Christmas cookies. In this movie, Arnold abandons his cool, comedic catchphrases in favor of stiff sarcasm. Sure, Arnold's lines are fairly comedic and he has a couple of hilarious scenes but his acting is painful to watch especially when he tries being excited. Speaking of which, he utilizes his eye bulging routine in "Jingle All the Way" more than any other film he has ever been in. Despite his flawed performance, I enjoyed watching Arnold act as a father who feels as if he must buy his son's love. Rita Wilson plays Arnold's wife, Liz, and she manages to pull through the movie past a few wooden instances. I have a mixed feeling towards Jake Lloyd. Sometimes Jake convinces me that he is a regular boy but at other times, I am reminded that he's an actor playing as a boy. The other cast members have stereotypical roles that do more harm than good for the movie. At first, Sinbad's character seems like a desperate father looking for a Christmas present until he abruptly goes off on a rant about his troubled family, his oppressed race, and marketing ploys. It's not a decent performance but it is strangely amusing to witness Sinbad whine and complain. Meanwhile, Phil Hartman overacts his role as the Langston's perverted, brown nose neighbor. He is supposed to act as the perfect kind of neighbor but he does way too much good for his fellow man. The only actor who fits his role is James Belushi as the corrupt Santa Claus but he is given too little time to bring out his goods. The movie is not as terrible as some people proclaim it to be because there are funny sequences to laugh and enjoy. A family celebrating Christmas would find "Jingle All the Way" stupid but entertaining to watch. The parents may raise their eyebrows but will laugh with the kids at the right moments.

As a fan of Arnold it was hilarious seeing him run through this silly Christmas flick. One liners and all the Terminator is here to cause laughter :D This is no more no less really, just a funny Arnold flick. There were a few unnecessary bad words but overall the film contains a good message. It may come out as ridiculous at first but look at it. Some things it says are true. Most of us have done the last minute Christmas hunt for a silly plastic toy. The film just shows this in a comical matter. The extreme measures these two men show to get this toy only makes for more fun.All the actors performances were nothing outstanding but just what you would expect. Considering the content of this film you can't really go anywhere but down acting wise. The actors filled their roles well and their is no one else I would have liked to see more as the father then Schwarzenegger.The film also shows how some people go all out on Christmas but they fail to get the true meaning of what it is really all about. They fail to teach their kids what really matters, instead appeasing them with insignificant toys and games. The grand Turbo man display in the Christmas parade leaves one thinking, has Christmas got that commercial? I guess I am taking this flick to seriously though, considering how ridiculous it is.At points the over the top nature of the film, such as Arnold flying in the turbo man suit, left me shaking my head. However it left me laughing hard more then not. Its a good break from all the serious films that always get you down. Lets face it, this kind of silliness is nice sometimes. You can just laugh out load and not worry about all the hidden meanings and such.I saw the film expecting stupidity and I got a lot of laughs! For a fan of Arnold or anyone looking for a fun laugh I'd suggest you go out and rent or buy this. Appropriate for the kids too!

Sometimes critics mistake.This is definitely an example.You see some movies don't need to be reviewed,you just need to watch them first,and then judge your feelings. So idea of the movie is great,and its pretty familiar to EVERY father on Christmas.And that's why people like to associate themselves with Arnie's character.There are a lot of misadventures(you wont remember every after ending i promise),but they actually work out pretty entertaining,sometimes even laughably funny (Santa's gang scene). Also contains good soundtrack,that includes Chuck Berry's "Run Rudolf,Run". i also like casting choice for Ted.I don't like this type of sleazy scumbags,thats why he is so realistically annoying.Not much else to say,WATCH IT NOW.

Jingle All the Way is far from perfect, but it is fun and worthwhile. The plot tells of an overworked businessman who wants to buy a Turbo Man, the year's hottest toy, for his neglected son. In the title role of Howard Langston, Arnold Schwarznegger acquits himself well, particularly in the action sequences. The soundtrack is awesome, the film is not too bad to look at and the climax is a lot of fun if very far fetched. Sinbad is amusing is Myron, and James Belushi is great as the Crooked Santa. Phil Hartmann(while he has been better) is hilarious as Ted, the phone conversation between him and Howard is a hoot. Rita Wilson does a good job as the mother, and Jake Lloyd is cute as Jamie. The film has some nice messages for kids. While the film is funny in places, the humour is questionable sometimes. The film is also rather short, and perhaps a tad rushed. Also Brian Levant's direction could have done with a harder edge. Still, despite the failings, it is a fun Christmas comedy, that is not really to be taken seriously. I call it a guilty pleasure. 6/10 Bethany Cox

First of all, let me say I am way easier on Christmas movies than I am general releases. I don't know why. Maybe its that its the time of the year, and all the tinsel dust gets settled into my brain until I am in a stupor...But this movie is not that bad. If you just look at it as a lighthearted, fun with the family movie, then you will have fun. It does get real, real cheesy at times, but most of the movie is funny and entertaining. That's all you can ask for from a movie. The biggest drawback is Jake Lloyd. I have never liked him as a child actor. You could always tell he is acting, and he always sounds so damn whiney. Heck, behind Jar Jar, Jake Lloyd is the most annoying actor.Other than that, it is fun. Hey, if it comes on TV, pop some pop corn, grab the kids, and tune in!

This film shows the insanity of Christmas. Two parents, who waited untill the last minute to buy a popular gift for their child, spend all of Christmas Eve trying to come up with the toy. They were vicious and violent with each other in their efforts to secure the piece of plastic junk for their little darling. This picture shows just how goofy people act at this time of year. Instead of preparing, most folks wait till it is too late; all in the name of Christmas spirit. Arnold portrayed a man who ignored his boy all year, and then tried to buy his love at Christmas with a pitiful little bauble. How true of real life. A funny movie on one hand, a tragedy on the other. Look and learn.

Sigh, Jingle All the Way, how this film has a rating that is above the 4.0's on IMDb boggles my mind. This is one of the scariest films of all time. First off, we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Terminator, he's playing this wacky almost like 80's silly comedy show type of Father Knows Best. Second, I think this is the film that just gives up on us, it goes from alright to stupid to silly to bad to just plain awful. Third there is nothing redeemable about this movie: the terrible acting, the lousy story, the crappy moral behind it's shallow message, and Arnold's accent, granted the accent has gotten him a career, but still it's disturbing the way he presents some of his lines. Not to mention that for some odd reason they put Sinbad in this movie, sorry to say but he is just not funny, actually no body, even one of the best voice actors of all time: Phil Hartmen... I can't believe he took on this movie.Howard Langston is often busy at his job, and has a hard time finding time for his wife, Liz and his young son, Jamie - especially when compared to next door superdad divorcé, Ted Maltin. After breaking his word again by missing Jamie's karate grading, Howard resolves to redeem himself and his marriage by fulfilling Jamie's ultimate Christmas wish, an action figure of Turbo-Man, a popular children TV superhero. Unfortunately, as is the habit with him, Howard has promised to buy that figure earlier that year and then promptly forgotten about it. To make things even harder, Turbo-Man toys are the must-have gifts of the season, and stocks of Turbo-Man toys are quickly drying up all over the country. Desperate not to disappoint his family again, Howard embarks on an epic city-wide quest to find the toy everyone's looking for. Along the way, Howard encounters Myron Larabee, a postal worker dad with a rival ambition, and the two quickly become bitter competitors in their race for the action figure. The chase begins to arise the ire of a police officer whom Howards keeps running into, and one of the most memorable scenes includes Howard desperately hooking up with a band of brand-spoofing crooks and ending up thrashing them. In addition, Ted attempts to hit on Liz, which she eventually turns down hard. The search climaxes with both dads masquerading as live action stuntman in a department store parade. As the "real" Turbo-Man, Howard uses the opportunity to present a coveted limited-edition Turbo-Man doll to his son in the crowd. But before he can recognize his dad, Jaime is chased around the parade by Myron, dressed as Turbo-Man's arch nemesis Dementor.Jingle All the Way is just one of those movies that you wonder how in the heck it got green lighted. It's just so stupid, I love how the ending, Myron tries to kill a child to get a stupid toy for his son and all is forgiven so easily. Gotta love how Turbo-Man has an Austrian accent, muscle bound, square jaw, tall... yet his own kid doesn't recognize him at all. Even the one scene that had a great joke, the bomb that was wrapped as a present, they even ruined that with a lousy slapstick joke that I know it was a family movie, but it just was stupid. But give or take, it's not that bad of a movie, there are some good jokes in it. I can't give Arnold a bad review, I just can't, it's not in my blood as a critic. There are some moments that are very funny like Arnold screaming at his neighbor for eating his wife's cookies. Also Arnold is just too likable as well as Phil Hartman. It's a light recommendation, not the worst movie of all time, but just one of the silliest.1/10

This film has taken a great many knocks over the years and I'll be the first to admit that it does have flaws. The conclusion, especially, is so sickly sweet that it sends your eyes rolling like slot machine spinners. Some of the things that Arnie does as he gets more and more desperate to track down a Turbo man doll for his son are cringe-worthy (I'm thinking particularly of when he stalks a little girl in the ball room at the mall) but they ultimately do function within the larger scope of the film.Arnold plays a father who was supposed to take care of getting a toy for his son. He's forgotten and has to go out on Christmas Eve to try and track one down. When he realizes that it is the hottest selling toy of all-time, High-jinx ensue.The thing with Arnie is that you're either going to take him or leave him. If you find his accent aggravating, or his acting wooden, then stay away from this film because you're just not going to like it anyway. I don't think he's that bad in this and I would go so far as to say that it is probably his second most successful comedy ("Kindergarden Cop" being my first choice -- "IT'S NOT A TOOMAH!!!" CLassic! Ha!). He's got an excellent supporting cast in this one: Jim Belushi as a seedy shopping mall Santa, Rita Wilson as Arnie's long suffering wife, Phil Hartman as the sugary sweet sleaze of a neighbour and of course the inimitable Sinbad. I would argue that the unlikely pairing of Sinbad and Arnie works extremely well and is probably the key to the film's success. Neither really has the acting chops to make the other look bad or out of place and so they are each able to hold their own when on screen at the same time.There is a tendency to take this film too seriously. It has a great satirical viewpoint. Who among the retail warriors can watch this film and not throw their hands up in the air saying "Idiots! You've left it to the last minute and you're getting exactly what you deserve!" Who among the legion of over-stressed and unlucky parents can't feel some sympathy for the plight of a man just trying to do right by his kid, even if it is a little too late? Jingle All The Way is a Christmas cure. It's a sharp point to puncture the over commercialism we get caught up in. This film is a chance to chuckle at ourselves and the insanity we leap into with enthusiasm annually. It is a ninety minute reality check and a chance to sit back, relax, and not take things so seriously. This isn't 'Scrooged,' or 'It's a Wonderful Life,' or 'A Christmas Carol.' It isn't the best of comedies or the best of Christmas films. But it is very honest about itself and not a bad way to spend the holiday.

People complain that movies about Christmas are too much about commercialism. This one most definitely is about commercialism and NOTHING else. The little brat named Jamie(Jake "I ruined Star Wars forever" Lloyd) makes his father promise to buy him a Turbo man doll for Christmas and acts like a spoiled brat when he doesn't get what he wants. Attempts at jokes are lame and stupid. Sinbad is horrible in this movie, and Arnold's only funny line is "Put dat cookhie down!". This movie also features the late Phil Hartman who is scummy and sleazy and evil in this movie. To sum up, the movie says you can ONLY be happy by getting material things for Christmas and it's worth it for adults to try and murder children for lame pieces of plastic. This movie is awful. If Arnold took out a gun, shot Jamie, shot Sinbad, and shot Phil Hartman(Yes, I know that's in bad taste), this would have been a tolerable movie. As it is though it is horrible, horrible, horrible. Avoid like the plague.

Watch it in the early '00 many times with my kids on a good old VHS. For them Jingle All the Way is now Nostalgia. Watch it again last week on tv and they still find it a funny movie.

For me 'Jingle All The Way' was unfairly panned by critics and is similarly overrated by general audiences who consider it to be the Christmas classic it is not.I think it has a strong premise about consumerism and the need for guilt ridden parents to buy their children's love. It delivers a plethora of crazy shenanigans en route to a fun climax. However, so much of the humour and character moments either irritate or do not work for me. I appreciate comedy is in the eye of the beholder so others may appreciate the humour more than me.I have always found Arnold Schwarzenegger to be an enigmatic personality. When you see him out of character being interviewed he can be incredibly charismatic and funny, yet when the cameras roll on a movie set he can be wooden and with little timing. 'Kindergarten Cop' worked better as he was a straight man to the children, but as Howard he struggles to play the clown. He is better at the more heartfelt family moments, but they feel somewhat forced at times.I find the antagonist character played by Sinbad pretty annoying and does not work in combination with Howard. Their banter, feels quite forced and awkwardly timed.The positives for me include the characters played by James Belushi and Phil Hartman, who lift the quality of their material with strong performances. I also like how outlandishly it shifts in tone as the story unfolds. This might be unintended, but when you take Howard from his rock bottom Grinch moment to his action packed Turboman finale in a matter of minutes you have to enjoy the ridiculousness for what it is.I think young Jake Lloyd struggles with some of the dialogue but do not blame him at all. With child actors the onus is on the script to be suitable and the director to draw out performances.

Satires are hard to come by. Good satires are much more rare. Satires that fooled everyone, from the audience to the actors playing in the film are toughest to find. Jingle All The Way achieves just that. By throwing a social commentary joke over the heads of audiences instead of into their minds, and then by delivering a biting message that stands just as true today as it did when it first came out, Jingle All The Way went from disappointment to one of the most realistic holiday films ever, despite its lack of realism. The hypocritical statements are flying in this first paragraph, but the truth is almost everyone missed the joke, the main picture. What looks like pure family fun turns into commentary with an attack on commercialism and the American public buying into the scheme. Even if you don't want to look into the deeper details, why skip out on Sinbad and The Terminator going at it?Jingle All The Way follows a workaholic dad by the name of Howard who disappoints his wife and son year after year. After missing another karate practice, Howard promises to not only show up at the parade the next day, but also get his son the TurboMan doll that is based off Jamie's favorite television show, favorite cereal, and favorite hero. The catch is simple: it is impossible to find the doll since it's a massive hit. Not only that, but most shipments are not arriving on Christmas Eve (notice the setting getting a bit dangerous), therefore increasing the supply-and-demand. Howard is still determined to find the doll and not disappoint again. Christmas Eve turns into D-Day on the shores of stores across the nation.This sort of idea has always been present in television shows everywhere, but to take a simple concept and stretch it into a full-length motion picture is a challenge to the utmost level. Thankfully, we have good writing by Randy Kornfield, decent direction by Brian Levant, and the supervision of Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter, Mrs. Doubtfire, Adventures in Babysitting). Looking past the seemingly heavy dosage of criticism against American society and Big Business, we see the cast throw our victim fathers into every possible awful and unfortunate scenario possible, and the range of ideas presented are amazing.Arnold Schwarzenegger must have a sense of humor, because he isn't afraid of embarrassing himself by getting beat up and pulverized by the holiday rush, a bitter mailman, and a Santa Claus that can scare blind children. His performance by no means is Oscar-worthy, but we see him with his determination like in his usual action films, but in a whole new arena, a totally different atmosphere, and that just adds a dosage of humor to the entire film. To see an action star have to claw his way out of a melee of people trying to get bouncy balls is priceless. Almost as rare as Schwarzenegger looking wimpy is Sinbad in a superb film. His performance as the disgruntled mailman just matches him perfectly, and his determination to get the doll is just as bad. Rounding out the cast is a bunch of underrated and/or B-list stars like the brilliant Phil Hartman, Rita Wilson, Robert Conrad, and James Belushi.Why in the world would anyone want to skip a movie in which we see a rumble involving an angry dad and a bunch of Santa Claus frauds running an illegal toy-manufacturing/distributing operation (Best scene of the movie for sure)? Why miss out on The Terminator take on a raging reindeer? Why skip out on a mailman posing as TurboMan's villain and flipping the bird to spectators during a family parade? With an endless amount of silly, over-the-top, brilliant moments in which represent Christmas at its truest, Jingle All The Way stands as the most realistic holiday movie ever, since it really shows what its all about. Forget the sappy messages you see in Christmas movies, it doesn't matter what you did, what illegal things you performed, how many assaults you have committed, as long as you get that gosh-darn toy for your child in Christmas, it will all be forgiven.Everything in this film, whether unintended or intentional, downplays the meaning of Christmas and all that goes on. There isn't a single decent Santa Claus in the film; they are all corrupt human beings with a different agenda. The stores are not trying to please anyone; they just want money for themselves and enjoy seeing people scrap for chances of earning a doll like starving dogs fighting over a hunk of meat. The main child doesn't say he wants his dad to stay home for Christmas, he says he wants a certain doll, and even recites the entire commercial, including the final words "Batteries Not Included." Nobody is helping each other; everyone is fighting, pushing people towards aisles and toy displays. While the entire thing is comical, it truly does happen in the real world. There was even one pivotal scene in which Byron the mailman discusses the importance of getting that special gift; he compares himself to another child that got the hot item on a certain year. Byron is disappointed, grows up to become a loser; neighbor that gets the doll becomes a multi-millionaire.Can a Christmas without material possessions scar you and turn you into a loser? Or is it Commercial America making it seem that way? Is this film a perfect satire or did it accidentally become that way? While the clues are pointing towards lampoon, Levant looks like he really aimed for the heartfelt, emotional Christmas movie with the bittersweet ending. Instead, we get a film that predates (and apparently predicts) the Tickle Me Elmo, Pokemon, Playstation, and Furby holiday horror stories. From the campy introduction to the hysterical final showdown, it's a great movie for what it is, and after aging like fine wine, becomes something moreaccidental or not.

''Jingle All the Way'' is a very cool movie I watched when I was 10 years old, and only watching it again so many years later, I recognize the boy who plays Jamie, to be the young Anakin Skywalker in the first movie! Anyway, I don't agree with the low rating of this movie, because it is a classic to watch in Christimas and I remember having much fun with it, even having some bizarre or impossible things happening in the story. (Let's not forget that it is a movie and the main goal is to have fun! And only now, I discover that the actor who played Ted in this movie,Phil Hartman,is dead..)In the story, Arnold is a busy father, who forgets to buy the toy his son wants for Christmas (Turbo man), and will be in the most ridiculous and funny situations to see if he have a chance to save Jamie's happiness.

I will keep this short and sweet...This is probably the worst movie that I ever seen in five years....The plot from the start is asinine but demonstrates the consumerist zombie American culture perfectly. You're telling me that in one of the largest cities in the world, you cant find one G.D toy? PLEASE! Then you have Sinbad playing this guy who wants the toy too for his kid, who also apparently can't find it in the same city, so he makes it his mission to get if from Schwarzenegger's character's kid...That's scummy enough...But to top it all off, the cherry on the ice cream, is at the end of the movie the kid actually hands the toy to Sinbad in some tacked-on phony sentimentality....I wanted to kill the kid! The only thing that was positive in this movie is Phil Hartman. He made the movie tolerable, but it was an infuriating waste of good talent. I cannot believe this movie even got a 5....Goes to show you how much the American collective intelligence has dropped!

"Jingle all the way" is a fine Christmas movie a light-hearted comedy and family film and should be judged accordingly... Considering the category, it gets an "A" in my book.I love this holiday gem, Arnold Schwarzenegger fan or not! Sinbad is a beautiful comedian and a solid casting choice for this holiday charmer. Add beloved Phil Hartman to the mix and great becomes better!If you're looking for cheer during the holiday season, you'll find it here. Highly recommended, if you're in the mood for comedy, adventure and fun... regardless of the time of season.If you love to laugh, you'll love this film!

If Arnold Schwarzenegger had not been the lead actor in Jingle All The Way, maybe I would've liked it more. He portrays his character in an awkward, out of place matter and sounds like he inspired Tommy Wiseau's voice in The Room. When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state.Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases.Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his "work is more important than family" attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure.The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House. You follow? Like Stephanie wants this gotta-have-it stuffed bear for Christmas, Jesse, Danny, and Joey try to obtain it on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth when it's out all across town. So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll.The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions.This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless. Maybe next year, Arnold might try his luck with Black Friday.Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, and Sinbad. Directed by: Brian Levant.

Perhaps I was reading too much into it, but I spotted some uncommon themes, and, perhaps, hidden messages in this movie. 1. Kids are ungrateful. 2. Kids are brainwashed. 3. The grass is always greener in the neighbour's garden. 4. It's always all about money. If you work a lot to provide a good living for your family, they will complain that you don't spend enough time with them. If you spend a lot of time with them, but don't make enough money, you will be blamed for your inability to provide good quality of life. You can never win. Kids only want acceptance from their peers. They are sheep and followers. If you don't get "the" toy (or, in this day and age, - "the" gadget), you are destined to be an outcast. Why is it this way? Subtle brainwashing by merchants that's been going on since the beginning of times."I wish my Dad was more like yours". Yeah, the grass is always greener in the neighbour's yard. If he really had *that* guy for a Dad, I bet he'd be saying he wished some other guy was his Dad. People rarely appreciate what they have. So, the kid is *real* p***ed at his Dad for missing his karate class, and keeps bitching that he doesn't spend enough time with him. But as soon as you promise to *BUY* him something, all is well again. Conclusion? Anything can be fixed with money. You're a good parent as long as you have money to *BUY* stuff. And... did it bother anyone else that Arnie's character used the situation he found himself in to select his own son as the winner of the special edition toy? Another observation: if given choice, people will inevitably do what is beneficial to *them* (even if it harms others), instead of what is fair or morally correct. Like I said, maybe I'm reading too much into it, or, perhaps, the movie does, indeed, have a deeper meaning. Whatever the case may be, I did like it, and if you don't try to over-analyze it (like I did), you will be able to enjoy it for what it is - a light-hearted comedy.

I didn't find anything worth laughing in the movie!it was completely boring,they had stretched the story for an hour and 30 minutes,with most of the time Howard roaming around to buy the action figure!The essence of a Christmas movies was lost,they have tried to come up with comedy,but it turned out to be really a bore.They could have come up with much more heart touching material,rather than a chase for a dumb toy.The role of Myron(played by Sinbad) wasn't pleasing,there was lack of humanity,it was cheap in a way.There was way too much exposure of low budget jokes!In a way it all seemed kiddish and annoying to watch.Well its an old movie cant complain more,its 2016,hopefully there wont be another Christmas movie like this to ruin the holiday!!

I thought this movie was not bad...a bit on the silly side but still humorous. The competition between Sinbad and Arnie was pretty funny and it's amusing to watch Arnold's performance in comedic roles. A nice Christmas flick for jokes.

Jingle all the Way (1996): Dir: Brian Levant / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sinbad, Rita Wilson, Phil Hartman, James Belushi: Perhaps the stupidest Christmas film imaginable. It had to be a real warped mind to conjure this garbage up. A man is stampeded by a group of immature adults seeking a Turbo Man action figure. This is obviously the Christmas version of lame action movies with violence toned down to Arnold Schwarzenegger clubbing a line of Santas with a giant candy cane. Directed by Brian Levant who was responsible for the horrible screen adaptation of The Flintstones. Well, he hits even lower notes here. Schwarzenegger and mail carrier Sinbad compete for the action figure in what can easily be described as career suicide for both. One particularly stupid scene at a radio station has Sinbad holding off police with a gift that he claims is a bomb. When it actually turns out to be a bomb, Sinbad asks, "What is the world coming to?" Perhaps the screenwriter can fill us in. In lame supporting roles are Rita Wilson as Schwarzenegger's wife and Phil Hartman as his womanizing neighbor who threatens to move in on Wilson. James Belushi plays a nasty mall Santa who candy cane battles Schwarzenegger and it is embarrassing to watch. The film so cheap that it should be wrapped in a trash bag in hopes that Santa will deliver it down the nearest chimney fire. Score: 0 / 10

I first saw Jingle All the Way in 2018, and by that point, I had heard horror stories this being one of the worst Christmas movies ever made. Perhaps it was because I had no expectations for the movie going in, but I absolutely loved it, and now it's in my yearly cannon of holiday classics.Why? All of the actors are having a great time, and lean into the patently absurd script. Schwarzenegger steals the show, delivering quotable lines ("PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN"), great slapstick, and a ton of energy. Sinbad also delivers a surprisingly great comedic performance. Kids will absolutely love this movie, but there's plenty of humor that adults will enjoy too.The movie is *very* over-the-top; whether or not that's a good thing is purely up to taste. There's also a vaguely anti-consumerist message throughout the whole film, but the movie is the best when it avoids social commentary, says "screw it", and you end up watching a bunch of Santas fighting in a warehouse.A strong candidate for the most underrated holiday film, period. Give it another watch if you haven't already; high alcohol content egg nog will only enhance your viewing experience.

First, I wished I could give this movie a zero, but one is the lowest score IMDB allows.Ughh... I hated this movie! And who taught the script was worth for a movie??? This movie is a stupid and awful disaster of a Christmas comedy. I can't think of a worst family movie except KAZAAM with Shaquille O'Neal, ED with Matt Leblanc and SANTA WITH MUSCLES with Hulk Hogan!Here is the family friendly (No way in hell!) plot. A hard-working father has problems in keeping promises to his son. After a missed karate class he has to buy a Turbo man for his son but every store hasn't got them anymore. So he has to fight with everyone for obtain the damn action figure! Ending even in a parade and making a fool of himself.There are two types of bad movies. The first is the Super-cheap movies (like ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'', ''Manos the Hands of Fate'', ''Madmen of Mandoras''). Yes, this movies are made with super-low budget and they only do one thing, and do it well: Suck! The second type of bad movies, and ''Jingle All the Way'' is the king of this category, are the big-budgeted, bad and irritating movies. You feel so angry that you want to beat every single person that made it!''Jingle All the Way'' is a movie that made me feel very enraged after I watched it. The few other movies that caused me such a reaction were BABY GENIUSES, FREDDY GOT FINGERED and SANTA WITH MUSCLES. And with such a plot the director and producers only could had kidnapped relatives in order to force Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Conrad to star in this movie. And they must have screamed ''CRAP-FEST'' while making this movie. I'll give you three examples of how annoying all the other characters were:Sinbad: Oh, I hated him! He was so obnoxious and so unbearable that I always rooted for the ones that hurt him. Somebody should have said to Sinbad ''STOP, NO-ONE LAUGHS AT YOU''. And I hope he ended in jail at the end of the movie!Phil Hartman: the worst character put in a kids movie, he was only a buffoon that acted like some sort of a stud and nearly won Arnie's wife's attentions. Yeah, a good message kids! A mother super-floozy that is more interested in a bachelor only because keeps promises? All wrong folks!Jim Belushi: the worst Santa Clause ever, worst than Hulk Hogan! He was so obnoxious, stupid and unlikeable that you want to smash the TV with an hammer and all the other Santa Clauses ended the way they deserved: In JAIL for the rest of their lives!And, as for Mickey Rooney's pointless cameo, it really did nothing to me (much like his other cameo in BABE PIG IN THE CITY).So, if you like bachelors that steals other wives, criminals dressed as Santa Clause and a vicious reindeer, this IS the movie for you! Think of ''Ed'', ''Baby Geniuses'', ''Howard the Duck'', ''Problem Child 2'' mixed all together in a movie and written in a room full of mandrills! This is the result.That's it! Nothing funny, nothing endearing and nothing worth seeing in this movie. It's just stupid (and I felt a idiot watching it), pointless and no good for kids. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE LIKE POISON!! Don't say I didn't warn you! And don't you dare showing this movie to your children!

This is by far one of the classic Christmas movies. We have it in our DVD collection and watch it every year. It is funny with a great story behind it. It takes the toy craze that seems to come every Christmas ( i.e. Cabbage Patch dolls, Tickle Me Elmo, etc.) and makes a funny story of it. Arnold, Sinbad, James Belushi and Phil Hartman makes this a really great movie. Jake Lloyd can't act to save his life, but that is well known - especially after Phantom Menace.The one thing to be aware of is the DVD versions that are out there. The original is the best with the original movie soundtrack. When it was released later on DVD again, they changed the music. They put "I'm dreaming of a White Christmas" in part of the movie when Arnold is running around looking for Turbo Man. It is not suited to the scene at all. It was originally Brian Setzer's "Jingle All the Way" which fit the scene perfectly. So, avoid the version with the modified soundtrack.

Sinbad and Arnold are perfect in their comedy roles! Arnold as the dumb dad who waits until the last second to by a extremely popular toy called Turbo Man (a obvious poke at Power Rangers) for his son (played by Jake Lloyd, yes Anakin in Episode I). Meanwhile a zany Postman (played awesomely by Sinbad) is going for the toy as well. Racing through shopping malls, wringing each others necks, and even a fight for the toy in a radio studio "give-away" follows. Oh, and Phil Hartman is great as the OTHER DAD who has already bought the toy for his son and is tormenting Arnold about it. Great, just great!!! Downright hilarious the whole way through. Great true-to-life story about dumb fads like Beanie-Babies. Great fun for the holiday season, pick up "Jingle All The Way" Today!

As I reminisce my youth, I feel regret for having my parents go out and get me so many different toys. It was not as if I was a spoiled pain-in- the-butt but it was hard for them to keep up with what I was interested in. I went through a timeline of obsession with "Power Rangers", "Pokémon", "Digimon", and "Yu-Gi-Oh!" cards. I cannot imagine the sheer frustration my parents felt spending their hard-earned money on merchandise I would soon grow out of. I suppose my past has something to do with my sympathy for "Jingle All the Way" despite being a fairly bad movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Howard Langston, a hard-working salesman, who tries as hard as he can to spend time with his family especially his son, Jamie (played by child star Jake Lloyd). But every time Howard sees a great opportunity to fulfill his family duties, he encounters multiple set-backs whether it is traffic or the police. On Christmas Eve, Howard decides to make-up for all his troubles by buying his son an action figure of Turboman, a TV superhero beloved by children all over the world (He is nothing compared to my "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"). However, finding the most popular toy on the market during Christmas Eve proves futile. Howard is also forced to compete with another father, Myron Larabee (played by Sinbad), for Turboman. Throughout the day, Howard will face one problem after another on his quest to buy his son's Christmas present. As a comedy dependent on chaos and absurd behavior, "Jingle All The Way" offers fun but not enough intelligence. People run into boxes containing action figures and use toys to sabotage their competitors. In real life, the situation would be more mob-like and hazardous with shoving and occasional fist-fights. If the director (Brian Levant) wanted to make a point about Christmas commercialism, he should have made the last minute shopping much more realistic. Speaking of which, the people in "Jingle All the Way" are ridiculously easy to anger and they will react with cheesy lines ("I'm going to deck your halls") and violence. If you call me a conman, I simply shrug the name off, maybe laugh at you for being wrong. I am not going to hit anybody. Arnold gets into fights with everybody: a mall employee, Santa Clauses, midgets, giants, kids, parents, a cardboard stand, and even a reindeer that acts more like a dog. He is better off fighting a South American army than yelling at a neighbor for eating his Christmas cookies. In this movie, Arnold abandons his cool, comedic catchphrases in favor of stiff sarcasm. Sure, Arnold's lines are fairly comedic and he has a couple of hilarious scenes but his acting is painful to watch especially when he tries being excited. Speaking of which, he utilizes his eye bulging routine in "Jingle All the Way" more than any other film he has ever been in. Despite his flawed performance, I enjoyed watching Arnold act as a father who feels as if he must buy his son's love. Rita Wilson plays Arnold's wife, Liz, and she manages to pull through the movie past a few wooden instances. I have a mixed feeling towards Jake Lloyd. Sometimes Jake convinces me that he is a regular boy but at other times, I am reminded that he's an actor playing as a boy. The other cast members have stereotypical roles that do more harm than good for the movie. At first, Sinbad's character seems like a desperate father looking for a Christmas present until he abruptly goes off on a rant about his troubled family, his oppressed race, and marketing ploys. It's not a decent performance but it is strangely amusing to witness Sinbad whine and complain. Meanwhile, Phil Hartman overacts his role as the Langston's perverted, brown nose neighbor. He is supposed to act as the perfect kind of neighbor but he does way too much good for his fellow man. The only actor who fits his role is James Belushi as the corrupt Santa Claus but he is given too little time to bring out his goods. The movie is not as terrible as some people proclaim it to be because there are funny sequences to laugh and enjoy. A family celebrating Christmas would find "Jingle All the Way" stupid but entertaining to watch. The parents may raise their eyebrows but will laugh with the kids at the right moments.

As a fan of Arnold it was hilarious seeing him run through this silly Christmas flick. One liners and all the Terminator is here to cause laughter :D This is no more no less really, just a funny Arnold flick. There were a few unnecessary bad words but overall the film contains a good message. It may come out as ridiculous at first but look at it. Some things it says are true. Most of us have done the last minute Christmas hunt for a silly plastic toy. The film just shows this in a comical matter. The extreme measures these two men show to get this toy only makes for more fun.All the actors performances were nothing outstanding but just what you would expect. Considering the content of this film you can't really go anywhere but down acting wise. The actors filled their roles well and their is no one else I would have liked to see more as the father then Schwarzenegger.The film also shows how some people go all out on Christmas but they fail to get the true meaning of what it is really all about. They fail to teach their kids what really matters, instead appeasing them with insignificant toys and games. The grand Turbo man display in the Christmas parade leaves one thinking, has Christmas got that commercial? I guess I am taking this flick to seriously though, considering how ridiculous it is.At points the over the top nature of the film, such as Arnold flying in the turbo man suit, left me shaking my head. However it left me laughing hard more then not. Its a good break from all the serious films that always get you down. Lets face it, this kind of silliness is nice sometimes. You can just laugh out load and not worry about all the hidden meanings and such.I saw the film expecting stupidity and I got a lot of laughs! For a fan of Arnold or anyone looking for a fun laugh I'd suggest you go out and rent or buy this. Appropriate for the kids too!
