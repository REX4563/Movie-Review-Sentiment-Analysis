The film was introduced by the film's writer director Pascal Laugier at this year's Frightfest in London. The organiser's referred to the film as "The film they most wanted" of the 28 shown at the festival. It was easy to see why. Of all the films I saw at this year's Frightfest, Martyrs was not my favourite but without a doubt it is the one that plays on my mind the most. The film has been compared to both Hostel and Hellraiser but I think it has a lot more substance than both of those films. The central performances are top notch and Jessie Pham as the young Lucie is very convincing, completely holding your attention. So why only 7 out of 10? As well made as this film is, the subject matter is just so utterly disturbing I wanted this film to end a long time before it actually did. It is not a film that is to be enjoyed. It is not the escapism that you may be looking for. The first Act is a revenge story on a family who may or may not have been responsible for the kidnapping and torture of a young girl 15 years previously. It is the second Act though that is the more disturbing. The viewer wants it to end almost as much as the girl captured wants her ordeal to end. This is a must-see movie but certainly one that is going to divide audiences right down the middle.

I wonder why so many compare this to movies like "hostel"... There was only one movie coming up my mind after having seen this one: Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" (and other works from him...)Other comparisons? OK, let's compare this to "high tension"... yes, we get realism. but then? There are too many movies recently that do nothing but hide their lack of spirit and story... in the end the audience is left alone without a believable motivation for what happened..."Martyrs" is different. It's scary and disturbing. It's painful to watch and still there is some kind of relief. You may separate that movie into three segments... and the first two would make a whole movie on their own. What happens then takes the story to whole new level and the audience to a whole new perspective. With a cynical bang in the end.I liked it.

This is not a horror movie. Its a harrowing study into the depths of human depravity. There is absolutely NOTHING to compare it to!The story is deep, horrific and heart breaking.You may wish you had not watched it, and the film will haunt your mind and heart for weeks/months/years.It must also be mentioned that the acting, all around, is absolutely superb, as is the screenplay and cinematography.Should be an essential subject of study for any aspiring film makers.There can never be another ''Martyres''.. Impossible.

I attended the Midnight Madness screening of Martyrs at the 33rd Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).The first hour and a bit of Martyrs was quite effective in delivering unsettling imagery and sounds. Elements of child abuse is something that is certainly unnerving so it's subtext in the film added to the creepiness factor. the gore had it's place; it wasn't presented just for the sake of gore in of itself. Special makeup effects artist Benoît Lestang who passed away several weeks ago (as noted by director Pascal Laugier during the Q/A session after the screening) did a remarkable job to showing the brutal effects of violent physical injuries. The audience reaction is typical MM stuff: audible gasps, rolls of nervous laughter, loud and appreciative applause to truly gruesome scenes and other good stuff.The last thirty minutes of the film held the audience in almost complete silence. The lack of any crowd reaction, aside from the revelation of what happened to Anna in her final stage, was due to the harrowing endurance test they and Anna (played by Morjana Alaoui) went through. The film turned from a highly engaging gore flick into a sad and rather depressing reflection of human suffering.I had a strong reaction to the film that lead me to appreciate it on its dramatic and production levels. The filmmakers and actresses obviously had a lot of trust among themselves to deliver this film. after the screening Pascal Laugier, Morjana Alaoui and Mylène Jamanoï went up onstage to answer questions from MM programme director Colin Geddes and several members of the audience. Pascal fielded most of the questions while Morjana and Mylène nervously chimed in with their responses (mainly because neither of them speak English natively nor are they accustomed being infront of such a massive crowd of people). The Q/A session did get a bit awkward because some killjoy decided to challenge Pascal on why he made Martyrs. As to the context in which Martyrs was first conceived, Pascal mentioned he is going through deeply personal issues which (unsurprisingly) translated themselves, quite graphically, into Martyrs.I'm pretty sure Martyrs is too intense for the general public so don't expect a wide theatrical release of the film. I could go on much further but that would necessitate revealing plot points and specific scenes.

French horror has been pushing the boundaries for some time now. First there was Haute Tension, then A l'Intérieur and newest in line is Martyrs, hyped up to take it all a little further. And it did, it definitely did. It's just that it doesn't belong in the same list as the films mentioned before. Martyrs goes way beyond.Those expecting another fun, bloody, gory, insane horror flick can just up and leave, because Martyrs isn't like that. While it borrows the horror from films like A l'Intérieur and Haute Tension, the tone and effect of the film is much closer to Irréversible or better yet, Grandrieux's La Vie Nouvelle.All these films belong to the French Extreme wave, a rather broad line of films of different backgrounds and themes, but all bearing an unrelentless level of extremity. And Martyrs stands proudly at the top of that list, even though Laugier himself seems a little hesitant to claim all credits for his film.Martyrs starts off like you'd expect a bleak, raw and pitch black horror flick to start off. Only minutes into the film, bodies start flying and guts is spilled royally. Strangely though, there's no joy, limbs are flying enjoyment to be found. The presentation is cold, the characters are emotionally wrangled, the tension is harsh. Lucie, the main characters and victim of a year long torture plan, evokes the sympathy of the viewer and plays it out incredibly well.The first half of the film keeps balancing on borderline horror, keeping its crude and dark exterior, but never crossing any boundaries. A Grudge-like ghost in added to the film, but Laugier stays close to the drama and never allows the film to become a mere horror flick. Things take a turn for the worse around halfway through, where the torture theme of the film is given even more power as Anna, Lucie's guardian, discovers the truth about the torture/kidnap story of the past.From that moment on, the film becomes really uncomfortable to watch and crosses over to the realm of Noé and Grandrieux. We are witness of cold and painful torture scenes, driven to very unpleasant extremes nearing the end. The film follows the methods of the people who torture, which are based on repetition and endurance, making it all the harder to sit through.In a rather surprising move, this film was released in theaters in Belgium by one of the most prestigious labels here, the reason for that is laid bare in the second half of the film. Rather that simply serve a story of horror and torture, Laugier digs deeper into the human mind. The idea behind Martyrs is not futile nor easily forgotten. There's a whole point to the film, elevating is above all its reference points (Saw and Hostel - sadly enough).Martyrs is in a whole different league and is everything a film like Funny Games should have been. A definite assault to the gut, extremely graphic and to the point, without ever flinching or resolving to silly tricks to get a point across. It's a film only a director with love for the genre could make (remember that Mr Haneke, after two pointless attempts) and Laugier doesn't let down.Visually, the film is well shot, though nothing out of the ordinary. The make-up on the other hand deserves some praise, same as the leading ladies who play their parts with conviction and depth (at one point Anna even shows a creepy resemblance to Falconetti in Jeanne d'Arc) . Essential to the film and certainly not an easy task.Don't watch Martyrs to get a little horror kick, or to indulge in silly gorefests. This film will not deliver the fun thrills of regular horror movies, on the contrary. It's a bleak, depressive but all the more impressive look in the darker depths of the human condition, it will leave you cringing in your seat and it will make you want to look away. And it does so without ever numbing you down.One of the most impressive films I've seen this year, a definite favorite and one that'll receive my further support through a DVD purchase, though I have no idea when or if I'll watch it again. Laugier uses every bit of skill he has to make Martyrs as painful as possible, and reaches further than any other has. A very solid 4.5*/5.0*, though no recommendation from my side. Definitely not a film for everyone.

What an experience. I'm a big horror fan and am happy watching and enjoying 'popcorn' slasher movies for what they are but really the genre is crying out for more pictures that truly assault the senses.The French are particularly adept at painting bleak, unforgiving landscapes as well as thrusting you right into the action but rarely have I experienced anything quite so memorable as Martyrs.Comparisons will (and have) been drawn with Hostel, Saw, Hellraiser and others but this is really rather misleading. Further comparisons have been drawn with Inside, Frontiers, Funny Games etc. and while slightly more credible in that atmosphere and psychology play a far greater part, none come close to Martyrs.I'd challenge anyone not to be affected by this movie. It's gory, but you won't laugh. It's shocking, but you won't be able to look away. 24 hours later it's still running through my mind and if I see a better horror movie than this this year, I'll be truly amazed.As much as I'd love to write more this is most certainly a film you should watch knowing as little as possible. Suffice to say the acting, cinematography, score, atmosphere and unbridled tension combine to create one of the most engaging films in this genre of the last two decades.Watch it. Recommend it (it won't be easy) and let's hope Martyrs gets the credit it deserves.

This film is without a doubt the most horrific, disgusting kick to the senses I've ever seen. If you can sit and watch the whole film from beginning to end you will feel like you've been in an accident. This shouldn't be even classed as just a horror film it should have an entirely new classification. I seriously doubt that any film maker could ever surpass this film for pure nastiness without showing real life carnage for 2 hours. If you want to be able sleep after watching a film, don't watch this. I honestly wish I never watched it, not that it is't well made or well written, I just think that it goes to far down a vicious path.

I write my reviews based on two factors, how much I enjoyed watching the movie and how much I enjoy thinking back about it. This movie I don't want to think back to.This was well produced, well acted and the story is engaging. But the content is just too horrific. I sat though Saw and Hostel they were OK. This I found really disturbing. I fast forwarded at one point and was privy to watching some poor devil receive a year long kick-in condensed into 6 minutes. As I am not a sado masachist I found these protracted scenes not only disturbing but dull.I like horror, I like to be scared and when the lights come up think, 'wow, glad that wasn't me getting chopped up'. I feel like I am carrying this around with me.If you like really gruesome stuff (note the actual gore isn't that bad) then go for it! You'll love this. But if you want to keep a handle on your humanity then stay blissfully unaware of this movie.

this film is as terrifying as anything ever released. it takes events from modern headlines and carries them to horrible, but utterly believable extremes. performances, photography, editing, score, sound design, direction are all spot on. i live in a neighborhood where people literally get stabbed in the street, and this film scared the hell out of me. it creates a tension that is almost unbearable, and then it breaks your heart. the genius of this film is the degree to which you empathize and grow to love the protagonist(s.) i was skeptical when i was told about how people supposedly fainted in the theater when they saw it. after watching this film, i absolutely believe it. there is one scene in particular that made me dizzy.don't watch it alone, and don't watch it if you think horror films are supposed to make you laugh. this film will make you cry.

I think the best way to watch Martyrs is to go into the movie cold. I purposely avoided any reviews that appeared to contain spoilers and read very little about the film before viewing it. Say what you will about the movie, but it takes several truly wild plot turns and part of what I enjoyed about the film is the unpredictability. In the end though, I felt like the narrative was disjointed, the themes weren't fully fleshed out, and ultimately the ideas behind Martyrs struck me as the armature on which to support several scenes of cartoon horror violence followed by sadistic torture.On the plus side, the movie is extremely stylish and I thought the gore effects were very good. There are several familiar elements in the film but they're combined in such a disjointed way that it never becomes stale. Martyrs is certainly one of the more original horror films I've seen in recent years. The direction and acting were excellent for this kind of movie. Even though I felt manipulated at the end of the movie I couldn't help but find the last 15 minutes or so to be strangely moving. I'll never want to watch this movie again but I haven't stopped thinking about it since viewing it last week.Now, the bad part: Martyrs really does feel like two different films that both go on for too long and don't mesh together tonally. The first half of the film at first seems to have a supernatural element and the violence is cartoonish and somewhat over-the-top. After the initial shooting though, I thought the film stopped dead in its tracks for a good 10-15 minutes while we watch Marie wailing around and cutting herself. This got a bit dull.The second half of the film is potentially more interesting but far less entertaining. The cult shows up and Anna is imprisoned and tortured. Watching a seemingly typical nuclear family get blasted across the room by a shotgun is fun. Watching a woman forced to sit in her own waste, take periodic beatings to the face, and have her skin surgically removed, isn't "fun." The torture scenes went on for too long and way too grim and distasteful to be enjoyable.I'm not a prude. I loved (and own) High Tension, Sheitan, Frontier(s), Inside, The Ordeal, etc. I've seen and enjoyed a lot of movies with some seriously rough content. I just personally think a horror film either needs to be harmless escapism OR, if the idea is to strike a realistic tone, the ideas supporting the film need to somewhat justify the graphic violence on-screen.For this viewer, Martyrs missed the mark. Maybe it's because the Madmoiselle only appears on screen for a few brief scenes, but the cult aspects of the film didn't come across to me at all, so I had a hard time reading this movie as a critique on religious cultism. Martyrs actually seemed to justify their world-view, since the film clearly implies that Anna DID have a vision and one of her tormentors treats her with compassion near the end, which suggests to me that they're not pure evil and somewhat justified what they were doing to the poor girl.Really, it just seemed to me that Martyrs was banking on scenes of young, attractive women in agony and all the religious mumbo-jumbo was an after-the-fact attempt at "depth" to let the audience off the hook. I found this insulting, just like the flimsy philosophical ideas in Irreversible ("Time destroys everything" -- ooh! That's deep!).I also think Martyrs opened itself wide open to charges of sexism. At least Hostel had the good sense to have both male and female victims. Martyrs makes the weakest attempt to justify the fact that all its victims are young (and suspiciously good-looking) women. I could practically hear the screenwriter arguing, "See? Just because Martyrs consists of about 90 minutes of female self-mutilation, degradation and torture, that doesn't mean it's sexist!" Sorry folks, but I'm just not buying it. I expect garden variety misogyny in Friday the Thirteen but those movies don't ask me to take them seriously. If you want to make a deep philosophical point, you're going to have to ditch the cartoon violence and other horror tropes.Overall, Martyrs is well-made and intriguing but the ideology is a total mess and it's not a movie I ever want to see again. That said, I know horror geeks are going to love this one so I'd recommend it to the extreme movie crowd without reservation. Just don't expect a "masterpiece" - Martyrs is far from it.

Having missed the opportunity to catch this at the Midnight Madness showing in TIFF08, I decided to go against all stated horror movie rules and watched this today around midday at a complex in downtown Toronto.. It's difficult to know what to say about this movie really; like a birth or a death, you really have to experience it yourself and draw your own conclusions. What I will say is that as a committed horror freak, rare is the occasion when I tense up and watch a film contorted, somehow trying to protect myself from what I'm putting myself through.. It contains enough tough to see horror/gore to satisfy the bloodhounds (though it doesn't feel like another attempt to up the gore ante for the sake of it, thankfully) and then - if you can watch it and many couldn't - transcends the genre totally with a jaw-dropping final act which if you're interested in the human condition and the capacity for seemingly normal people to do incredibly bad things will have you asking questions for some time to come and recognising that when horror and ideas mesh successfully, the result can be breathtaking. Absolutely not enjoyable but there again if you go to see a horror flick at a film festival and you know beforehand that it originally received an X-certificate in France, kicking up an almighty stink in the process - well, you know that an open mind is the least you can bring to bear. With that in mind I would recommend Martyrs as a film of incredible tension, harrowing physical violence and indelible imagery; unsurprisingly, the director name-checked Dario Argento during the Q&A as a major influence in his youth and there is a clear and confident signature in the work which suggests some parallels can be made between the two film-makers. I loved this movie and for those who have already posted comments good, bad or indifferent (and I really can't imagine a neutral response!) I hope like myself you have come away with a genuine sense of having seen something the like of which we are unlikely to see for some time..

I've heard a lot of buzz about this film over the years but took a long time to watch it. I'm not a huge fan of extremism and this has always been billed as "one of the most disturbing horror films ever" so I put it off until I felt like I was ready. I've gotta say I ended up kind of underwhelmed.The film starts off strong. It is relentless, hits us hard with themes of trauma and its persistence in one's life. The story structure in the first 2 acts was a breath of fresh air. I feel like I can typically predict where the story will go in many films but found myself continuously surprised. It's super intense in terms of the violence, yes, but it all seemed to be serving to tell a poignant story.Then we hit the last act...and the reveal of the antagonists and their motivation was so boring. Then it was just 30 minutes of people beating the crap out of a woman. This isn't unique, this isn't poignant. It's just...sad and frankly boring as far as story structure goes. The ending tries to end on a cerebral note but was just not interesting or thought provoking to me. It frankly just seemed like lazy writing. I ultimately feel like the first 2 acts of the film alone would have made for a better movie.Overall, yes, one of the more brutal films I've seen. I respect it for the boundaries it pushes while trying to have some substance. However the substance that could've been ultimately fizzled out and I was left feeling like this could've been something more memorable.

I often wonder how much further the horror genre can and will evolve in terms of sadism and the portrayal of ultra-explicit violence. Especially the youngest generation of French directors appear to be involved in some sort of sport competition where each one aspires to surpass the other when it comes to showing sheer brutality and stomach-churning sickness. "High Tension", released in 2003, was quite extreme already, but since then there came "Them", "Frontier(s)" and "Inside" and each separate film raised the bar every time. Now, after experiencing the nearly indescribable intensity level of "Martyrs", I sincerely hope that no other movie will ever go beyond the standards set in this film. "Martyrs" genuinely is an astonishing and jaw-dropping ordeal that is guaranteed to leave even the most hardened and trained horror buffs speechless. From what I gathered reading reviews and listening to opinions left and right, I already knew this wasn't going to be picnic, but the truth is that absolutely nothing can prepare you for what you are about to see in "Martyrs". It may sound a little fantastic, but the infamous and supposedly nauseating torture porn titles such as "Saw", "Hostel" and "Murder-Set-Pieces" look like sophomoric episodes of Sesame Street in comparison with the recent stream of French shock-features and in particular with "Martyrs".Okay, I realize I've been going on and on about the shocking impact and extreme violence of "Martyrs", but still I haven't even mentioned the most remarkable and praiseworthy aspect about the entire film. The gore, barbarity and mayhem aren't at all gratuitous or exploitative but actually serve a purpose! There were other and far more mundane "extreme" horror movies simply showcase a long series of torture sequences, "Martyrs" practically causes you to experience the pain AND simultaneously raises a handful of socially engaging debates. For once, the title of a horror movie can be taken 100% literally By watching "Martyrs", you expose yourself to martyrdom. You voluntarily watch the film and you're free to look away or step out of the theater at any given moment, but most likely you won't because subconsciously you are in readiness to endure a whole lot of visual suffering in order to know how the movie will end. Yes, it all does sound very philosophical and pseudo-intellectual (especially for a horror movie), but honestly not a single word is exaggerated. This movie honestly is the genre landmark of a new generation The synopsis on the back of the DVD appears to give away the content of the entire film, but in fact it only covers the first ten minutes. The short summary describes how a 12-year-old girl narrowly escapes from an abandoned factory site where she was held captive and subjected to extreme torture. She ends up in a psychiatric clinic and befriends another girl who slowly helps her processing the trauma. 15 years later, the girl appears on the doorstep of a seemingly happy family of four with a shotgun in her hands and raging fury in her eyes. Lucie is convinced she found her tormentors. Apart perhaps from the domestic household element, this sounds like the plot of nearly every "revengesploitation" movie ever made. But these are only the opening minutes What follows next is a literally perplexing and excruciating visual nightmare that is unpredictable and even unimaginable. At first you'll wonder where writer/director Pascal Laugier can possibly be heading for with his screenplay, and then you'll probably wish you never asked. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, so let me just re-establish that you will be unprepared and stupefied. Do you dare?

...and what we're ultimately allowed to witness is, at its core, some pretty empty-headed, although visceral, existentially sadistic nonsense. Nonetheless, I can't deny that "Martyrs" packs a punch (several of them, in fact, to the face and gut, repeatedly, to its protagonist, after fooling us about who the real protagonist is). It's ultra-violence that Alex and his droogies would lap up like synthemesc milk-plus; presumably the audience is meant to as well. Aha, but auteur Pascal "The Tall Man" Laugier isn't through with us yet! After rubbing our collective noses in viscous pools of vengeance and hallucinatory blood guilt, he dials up the sadism a few more notches with a tiresome third act that trucks in absurdist fantasies of an elite cabal searching for proof of an afterlife through the inducement of a tortured martyr's vision of what can only be feebly represented by a coruscating white light.What tripe.Neither the acting chops of the two leads, which are considerable, nor the overall production values, including some very convincing Grand Guignol splatter and grue, can conceal the vacuous conceit of the film's plot nor the soul-less nihilism of its theme. "Martyrs" leaves its audience numbed by its brutality, but with precious little else, and ultimately comes off as mere torture-porn with a glib pretension of meaning. I won't say it's not worth watching, but be prepared to be unsatisfied. Mayhaps that was Laugier's intent; if so, his intentions were shallow and venal.

I wouldn't consider myself someone who dislike excessive gore/violence/torture. I love Hostile, Cannibal Holocaust and I think Green Inferno was pretty good.But to me a horror movie that has excessive gore has to be doing it for a purpose: to scare, to make social commentary, or just to amuse (in the case of green inferno)Martyr seems to be torture for repulsions sake which I am against. Like August Mordum Requiem, I don't care for movie that's showing me realistic torture just to disturb me.It's not really scary and more just disgusting.It's just EXCESSIVE with the torture and at the end all they throw on it is an ambiguous ending that doesn't really make the slog through the torture worth it.Although I liked the ending, and do think about it from time to time, it was one of the ONLY parts I liked about the movie.If I were to re-watch it I would only watch the ending. And that to me is a bad sign.I don't want to be the person who gives a movie a bad review because it's "too graphic" but I will be the guy who gives it a bad review because the movie is just glorified torture porn, with only a "okay" ending that offers very little in terms of commentary/thought provoking, but just enough to give it a 7.The ending is the only thing that saves this movie for me, and even than it's just one of those half assed *the writer couldn't think of a good enough answer to the questions he asked so he just left them un-answered" cop-out ending.Watch this movie if you want to see realistic torture. If you expect more out of a film than just watch a youtube video explaining the plot. (isn't really much to explain, because the writer clearly didn't have an answer so he left it a mystery)

A young girl named Lucie escapes from a hellish nightmare of torture and depravity. She meets a friend, Anna, who stands by her as the two grow up. But Lucie's scars are mental as well as physical and 15 years after her escape, she seeks revenge on her captors. Anna is soon dragged into the situation and what she finds makes her own abusive childhood seem like a walk in the park.I love horror movies. I like many movies that have been lumped into the "torture porn" category (even though I hate that term) and I like horror movies that can disturb me and make me think with barely an ounce of gore. But I felt more manipulated than moved by Martyrs. The story of Lucie getting revenge on her abusers and dealing with the scars of her past while unraveling the mystery of her capture could have made for an interesting movie, but the Lucie part is over fairly quickly. And I don't really want to give too much away but the Anna part of the story seems to go out of its way to be needlessly "unpleasant" for a motive that just didn't work on me. I appreciate the movie for trying to be different (and succeeding at that) but in the end, I was bored, frustrated, and disappointed.ff

The film was introduced by the film's writer director Pascal Laugier at this year's Frightfest in London. The organiser's referred to the film as "The film they most wanted" of the 28 shown at the festival. It was easy to see why. Of all the films I saw at this year's Frightfest, Martyrs was not my favourite but without a doubt it is the one that plays on my mind the most. The film has been compared to both Hostel and Hellraiser but I think it has a lot more substance than both of those films. The central performances are top notch and Jessie Pham as the young Lucie is very convincing, completely holding your attention. So why only 7 out of 10? As well made as this film is, the subject matter is just so utterly disturbing I wanted this film to end a long time before it actually did. It is not a film that is to be enjoyed. It is not the escapism that you may be looking for. The first Act is a revenge story on a family who may or may not have been responsible for the kidnapping and torture of a young girl 15 years previously. It is the second Act though that is the more disturbing. The viewer wants it to end almost as much as the girl captured wants her ordeal to end. This is a must-see movie but certainly one that is going to divide audiences right down the middle.

I wonder why so many compare this to movies like "hostel"... There was only one movie coming up my mind after having seen this one: Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" (and other works from him...)Other comparisons? OK, let's compare this to "high tension"... yes, we get realism. but then? There are too many movies recently that do nothing but hide their lack of spirit and story... in the end the audience is left alone without a believable motivation for what happened..."Martyrs" is different. It's scary and disturbing. It's painful to watch and still there is some kind of relief. You may separate that movie into three segments... and the first two would make a whole movie on their own. What happens then takes the story to whole new level and the audience to a whole new perspective. With a cynical bang in the end.I liked it.

It seems like every year you get a new french movie that the horror community talks anxious about mainly because of its boundary breaking shocks. After last years direct hit to the head "A l'interior" and the to me rather weak "Frontieres" this year its "Martyrs" which is supposed to raise the bar another bit and i start to wonder what makes the french go that berserk and over the top lately.Forsure "Martyrs" is different and delivers some memorable scenes punched in your memory, so it sure is another sign of Euro-Horror taking the top. The movie starts of with a child fleeing its prison and running frightened from years of abuse into freedom. Lucie is picked up, her prison is found but she doesn't talk about what happened and her torturers are never found. This is where the first part of the movie starts which is kind of divided into sub-plots. Lucie is shown growing up in a foster home, making friends with Anna, another foster child. Lucie doesn't talk to anyone about what happened, she is haunted by fears, sees demons and only seems to connect to Anna. The second part is a harsh time jump to 15 Years later. A seemingly happy family is having a Saturday breakfast the door rings and Lucie takes them out with a shotgun. She has identified her torturers from a newspaper photo and came for revenge and closure, When cleaning up the mess with Anna Lucie sees a demon like girl following her through the house and cutting her with a knife. After some creepy ghost scares it turns out its just her imagination of girl she left behind when fleeing as a child. Anna doesn't seem to believe all the story Lucie told her because we soon see the cuttings are self inflicted and only Lucie sees the girl as a manifestation of her schizophrenia which ends in her finally slicing her own throat. Part Three begins where Anna is left alone in the house with her dead friend not sure what happened and how to handle the situation. By a pretty stupid turn of events she finds a secret door to an underground dungeon and it soon becomes evident that Lucies depictions of her torture were true. Anna searches through the dungeons and soon finds the girl Lucie left behind shackled and blindfolded. She tries to help her and remove the blindfold which is bolted to her head but the girl like Lucie soon tries to kill herself. Part Four and the finale begins, so there is some majors spoilers ahead... The girl runs wild through the house and is suddenly shot by a group of strangers who reveal the story: Asick religious group believes that a suffering person can see beyond death in their final stage of martyrdom and reveal the secrets to life and death. Now Anna relives what Lucie suffered and is brought to the dungeon. From here on a seemingly endless part shows her being fed, being beaten, having her hair shaved and all this in an endless repetition until she breaks apart. This is not gory, rather unpleasant in its repetitive inhumanity. To make a long story short... Anna falls apart, talking to her dead friend Julie who tells her to give herself up to stop the suffering and when she does the final stage awaits in which Anna is skinned until she finally enters Martyrdom depicted as a trip hallucinogenic "light at the end of the tunnel" sequence. She whispers her experience into the old lady's ear and the sick cult soon gathers to witness its Martyr and the old ladies testimony. Unfortunately we never hear it, but can rather imagine when the old lady puts a gun in her mouth. The End.I am very ambivalent with this movie... It is a nice mixture of a drama (especially the childhood part and Lucies suicide) with classic horror/ghost scare and shock elements and big load of "torture porn" thrown in at the end blended in with some religious and metaphysical hints. Anna becomes a kind of Jesus Christ and the image of a skinned girl looking to heaven sure is a logical step in depicting a person in total suffering equal to the crucifixion and to my understanding equally sick just visually more direct. The four parts are all told in a very different style ... its like drama, ghost-horror, a little dungeon exploring and darkness, some superficial explaining, torture and some more drama. Martyrs sure is an interesting movie but it has some pretty stretched passage. If people leave the cinema its because they can't take another five minutes of seeing a girl beaten either because its unsettling or just plain idiotic and voyeuristic. I sure get the meaning in showing Anna fall apart but I think this and the skinning which is not even shown is what people are shocked about. The interweaving of the movie parts was kind of forced which put me off. Why the hell do they stay in the house, how could the children of the family not know about a high tech torture dungeon under their living room (or did they?), why does Anna find the dungeon and go in there on her own and if the cult is so eager to find the answer why is there just one girl although the dungeon looks like an industrial complex and what about that cult anyway?!Its hard to compare the movie to anything else. Most comparisons are about the movies being all french, seeking for new boundaries and the main characters being girls. But they are all different and where "A l'interior" mixes Thriller- and Splatter-Elements "Martyrs" rather mixes Horror- and Drama-Elements... maybe the tear squeezing mixing with horror scares is what shocks people. Strange thing is... to me the scenes of Lucie fleeing as a child was one of the most shocking and I even knew them from the trailer.

Don't listen to the poor reviews on here - this is actually a masterpiece in horror but it's very difficult to watch.. It's dark. bleak and incredibly disturbing and despite this being one of the best films I've seen I could never watch it again..

This is not a horror movie. Its a harrowing study into the depths of human depravity. There is absolutely NOTHING to compare it to!The story is deep, horrific and heart breaking.You may wish you had not watched it, and the film will haunt your mind and heart for weeks/months/years.It must also be mentioned that the acting, all around, is absolutely superb, as is the screenplay and cinematography.Should be an essential subject of study for any aspiring film makers.There can never be another ''Martyres''.. Impossible.

Martyrs is probably the most extreme movie ever made in France, and cannot be compared with any other flick I have seen before.It was a unique and traumatic experiment to watch it in a theater where half of the audience left before the end, while the other half was feeling very uncomfortable. It is NOT for everybody, and you can really be upset at times, even if you are a basic horror fan as I am.This movie is not made to please the audience, especially the second part, except if you are seriously disturbed. I couldn't help thinking about The Screwfly Solution that Joe Dante made in reaction of all the gratuitous violence made to women in horror movies.Fortunately, the end of the movie gives enough meaning to what you have been through, watch the whole thing if you can.I gave a 7 because it's not a movie that you can really like or recommend to your friends, but I think it's a real milestone in horror, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre was in his time.

i was lucky enough to see this masterpiece at Frightfest this year.Pascale Laugier's worried about this movie. He was apologising to people who despised it, he was profusely thanking the people who liked it. He is the modern day equivalent of Victor Frankenstein. He knows that he has created a monster and doesn't really know how to deal with it now that it's being released upon the world.Martyrs truly is a monster. It's a ground breaking, brave, stunning, brutal & moving piece of work that is guaranteed to divide audiences everywhere it gets the chance to play. Even at a genre event like Frightfest the audience reaction ranged from 'loved it' to 'hated it' to people actually going outside of the cinema to be physically sick (really). For me it was the highlight of the festival and i absolutely loved it but I don't believe it's a movie that anybody will truly 'enjoy'.As others have already given away too much of the story i won't bother with a synopsis as Martyr's is definitely a dish best served cold. Not knowing what to expect makes this a refreshingly shocking piece of celluloid that will hopefully astound you with it's gutsy originality. Written by the director during a fit of depression (that he did not elaborate on in the Q&A) it is an almost schizophrenic movie with two distinct halves and coda of such ambiguity that it is possible to view it as nihilistic or strangely hopeful. It's beautifully shot, really well paced and contains outstanding performances from the two female leads.This movie is inevitably going to be compared to Hostel and other movies in the horribly monickered 'torture-porn' genre and that is a genuine mistake. Martyrs bears more resemblance to movies like Nacho Cerda's Aftermath as there is nothing here that is designed to be titillating. The true horror lies in the the clinical detachment of the antagonists. In the end, despite all the on screen violence (and there are some truly brutal scenes on display here in the movies second act) the prevaling reaction that this movie elicited in me was not one of revulsion but one of true sadness. Martyrs really is a truly brilliant, surprisingly moving film and one that will remain in my mind, jostling for attention with my other thoughts for a very long time to come. Thankyou Pascale Laugier for creating a monster that i love...

I attended the Midnight Madness screening of Martyrs at the 33rd Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).The first hour and a bit of Martyrs was quite effective in delivering unsettling imagery and sounds. Elements of child abuse is something that is certainly unnerving so it's subtext in the film added to the creepiness factor. the gore had it's place; it wasn't presented just for the sake of gore in of itself. Special makeup effects artist Benoît Lestang who passed away several weeks ago (as noted by director Pascal Laugier during the Q/A session after the screening) did a remarkable job to showing the brutal effects of violent physical injuries. The audience reaction is typical MM stuff: audible gasps, rolls of nervous laughter, loud and appreciative applause to truly gruesome scenes and other good stuff.The last thirty minutes of the film held the audience in almost complete silence. The lack of any crowd reaction, aside from the revelation of what happened to Anna in her final stage, was due to the harrowing endurance test they and Anna (played by Morjana Alaoui) went through. The film turned from a highly engaging gore flick into a sad and rather depressing reflection of human suffering.I had a strong reaction to the film that lead me to appreciate it on its dramatic and production levels. The filmmakers and actresses obviously had a lot of trust among themselves to deliver this film. after the screening Pascal Laugier, Morjana Alaoui and Mylène Jamanoï went up onstage to answer questions from MM programme director Colin Geddes and several members of the audience. Pascal fielded most of the questions while Morjana and Mylène nervously chimed in with their responses (mainly because neither of them speak English natively nor are they accustomed being infront of such a massive crowd of people). The Q/A session did get a bit awkward because some killjoy decided to challenge Pascal on why he made Martyrs. As to the context in which Martyrs was first conceived, Pascal mentioned he is going through deeply personal issues which (unsurprisingly) translated themselves, quite graphically, into Martyrs.I'm pretty sure Martyrs is too intense for the general public so don't expect a wide theatrical release of the film. I could go on much further but that would necessitate revealing plot points and specific scenes.

French horror has been pushing the boundaries for some time now. First there was Haute Tension, then A l'Intérieur and newest in line is Martyrs, hyped up to take it all a little further. And it did, it definitely did. It's just that it doesn't belong in the same list as the films mentioned before. Martyrs goes way beyond.Those expecting another fun, bloody, gory, insane horror flick can just up and leave, because Martyrs isn't like that. While it borrows the horror from films like A l'Intérieur and Haute Tension, the tone and effect of the film is much closer to Irréversible or better yet, Grandrieux's La Vie Nouvelle.All these films belong to the French Extreme wave, a rather broad line of films of different backgrounds and themes, but all bearing an unrelentless level of extremity. And Martyrs stands proudly at the top of that list, even though Laugier himself seems a little hesitant to claim all credits for his film.Martyrs starts off like you'd expect a bleak, raw and pitch black horror flick to start off. Only minutes into the film, bodies start flying and guts is spilled royally. Strangely though, there's no joy, limbs are flying enjoyment to be found. The presentation is cold, the characters are emotionally wrangled, the tension is harsh. Lucie, the main characters and victim of a year long torture plan, evokes the sympathy of the viewer and plays it out incredibly well.The first half of the film keeps balancing on borderline horror, keeping its crude and dark exterior, but never crossing any boundaries. A Grudge-like ghost in added to the film, but Laugier stays close to the drama and never allows the film to become a mere horror flick. Things take a turn for the worse around halfway through, where the torture theme of the film is given even more power as Anna, Lucie's guardian, discovers the truth about the torture/kidnap story of the past.From that moment on, the film becomes really uncomfortable to watch and crosses over to the realm of Noé and Grandrieux. We are witness of cold and painful torture scenes, driven to very unpleasant extremes nearing the end. The film follows the methods of the people who torture, which are based on repetition and endurance, making it all the harder to sit through.In a rather surprising move, this film was released in theaters in Belgium by one of the most prestigious labels here, the reason for that is laid bare in the second half of the film. Rather that simply serve a story of horror and torture, Laugier digs deeper into the human mind. The idea behind Martyrs is not futile nor easily forgotten. There's a whole point to the film, elevating is above all its reference points (Saw and Hostel - sadly enough).Martyrs is in a whole different league and is everything a film like Funny Games should have been. A definite assault to the gut, extremely graphic and to the point, without ever flinching or resolving to silly tricks to get a point across. It's a film only a director with love for the genre could make (remember that Mr Haneke, after two pointless attempts) and Laugier doesn't let down.Visually, the film is well shot, though nothing out of the ordinary. The make-up on the other hand deserves some praise, same as the leading ladies who play their parts with conviction and depth (at one point Anna even shows a creepy resemblance to Falconetti in Jeanne d'Arc) . Essential to the film and certainly not an easy task.Don't watch Martyrs to get a little horror kick, or to indulge in silly gorefests. This film will not deliver the fun thrills of regular horror movies, on the contrary. It's a bleak, depressive but all the more impressive look in the darker depths of the human condition, it will leave you cringing in your seat and it will make you want to look away. And it does so without ever numbing you down.One of the most impressive films I've seen this year, a definite favorite and one that'll receive my further support through a DVD purchase, though I have no idea when or if I'll watch it again. Laugier uses every bit of skill he has to make Martyrs as painful as possible, and reaches further than any other has. A very solid 4.5*/5.0*, though no recommendation from my side. Definitely not a film for everyone.

As a torture porn this is well made. Maybe among the best. So well made that I would not recommend this movie to most viewers.With a very vague ending and general plot line of the movie it has a dissent attempt to raise questions, provoke some thoughts and start discussions.But as a movie as whole, it is just Ok.Some parts of the movie are glued together by very stupid plot devices. So, when bad stuff happens it is hard to connect to the characters who keep doing same mistake again, and again, and again.As to the ending. Yes - it is wide open for interpretation. I've counted at least 4 possible explanations. It is just none of them are good enough to justify plot holes and all the pain and suffering...

I watched this movie, because I enjoyed the director's "Tall Man". Someone reviewing that film mentioned this one, saying, that it contained social comment, as did "Tall Man". The first part of this movie seemed gritty and quite realistic, and I could empathize with the characters, who were abused children. The second part of the movie (it has three distinct parts) begins with a shocking scene, which I felt totally morally bankrupted the film, as the abused girl kills children, the children of her abusers. Maybe it's just me, but I have a hard time believing someone tortured as a child and still in great pain from it, would coldly murder other children. In any case, this second section is more standard "horror movie" fare, and I lost my empathy for the main character, as an abused child. The second main character alone survives until the third section. Here she is accosted and tortured graphically for a long period of time. At this point, as I did with "Funny Games", I'm asking myself, "Why are the film-makers showing me this?" I am not entertained by watching people suffer, unless there is some redeeming, meaningful reason for showing this. Unfortunately, I could not find one here. A gang of insane, old, rich, white people babbling some quasi-metaphysical nonsense AIN'T a reason. Crazy people will commit any manner of atrocity, but it won't make any sense and I don't need to watch it. Thank God, this director got a little more realistic for his next feature. If you want to show children being tortured, you better have a hell of a good reason for it. The last two thirds of this film just left me empty. Amazingly, I didn't even feel for the girl, who gets tortured in the last third. That's how meaningless this scene was. I saw a reason why Hanaeke was showing me pain in "Funny Games" (that I, as an audience member was a voyeur) and Noe's "Irreversible", showed me the truly sickening nature of real, out-of-control violence. I felt the violence in those films was justified. Here, I could find no justification.

What an experience. I'm a big horror fan and am happy watching and enjoying 'popcorn' slasher movies for what they are but really the genre is crying out for more pictures that truly assault the senses.The French are particularly adept at painting bleak, unforgiving landscapes as well as thrusting you right into the action but rarely have I experienced anything quite so memorable as Martyrs.Comparisons will (and have) been drawn with Hostel, Saw, Hellraiser and others but this is really rather misleading. Further comparisons have been drawn with Inside, Frontiers, Funny Games etc. and while slightly more credible in that atmosphere and psychology play a far greater part, none come close to Martyrs.I'd challenge anyone not to be affected by this movie. It's gory, but you won't laugh. It's shocking, but you won't be able to look away. 24 hours later it's still running through my mind and if I see a better horror movie than this this year, I'll be truly amazed.As much as I'd love to write more this is most certainly a film you should watch knowing as little as possible. Suffice to say the acting, cinematography, score, atmosphere and unbridled tension combine to create one of the most engaging films in this genre of the last two decades.Watch it. Recommend it (it won't be easy) and let's hope Martyrs gets the credit it deserves.

This film is without a doubt the most horrific, disgusting kick to the senses I've ever seen. If you can sit and watch the whole film from beginning to end you will feel like you've been in an accident. This shouldn't be even classed as just a horror film it should have an entirely new classification. I seriously doubt that any film maker could ever surpass this film for pure nastiness without showing real life carnage for 2 hours. If you want to be able sleep after watching a film, don't watch this. I honestly wish I never watched it, not that it is't well made or well written, I just think that it goes to far down a vicious path.

I write my reviews based on two factors, how much I enjoyed watching the movie and how much I enjoy thinking back about it. This movie I don't want to think back to.This was well produced, well acted and the story is engaging. But the content is just too horrific. I sat though Saw and Hostel they were OK. This I found really disturbing. I fast forwarded at one point and was privy to watching some poor devil receive a year long kick-in condensed into 6 minutes. As I am not a sado masachist I found these protracted scenes not only disturbing but dull.I like horror, I like to be scared and when the lights come up think, 'wow, glad that wasn't me getting chopped up'. I feel like I am carrying this around with me.If you like really gruesome stuff (note the actual gore isn't that bad) then go for it! You'll love this. But if you want to keep a handle on your humanity then stay blissfully unaware of this movie.

this film is as terrifying as anything ever released. it takes events from modern headlines and carries them to horrible, but utterly believable extremes. performances, photography, editing, score, sound design, direction are all spot on. i live in a neighborhood where people literally get stabbed in the street, and this film scared the hell out of me. it creates a tension that is almost unbearable, and then it breaks your heart. the genius of this film is the degree to which you empathize and grow to love the protagonist(s.) i was skeptical when i was told about how people supposedly fainted in the theater when they saw it. after watching this film, i absolutely believe it. there is one scene in particular that made me dizzy.don't watch it alone, and don't watch it if you think horror films are supposed to make you laugh. this film will make you cry.

I don't really want to say very much about this film. In some ways, it's a film I wish I could forget. It's a film I will most likely never watch again. I will say that most of the scenes in the film, at least in the first two thirds, are sickening and horrible and full of extreme human cruelty, violence, and gore. However, the film turns into something far worse than that in the last act. The film depicts pure evil and the true deterioration of the human soul and body about as bluntly as it possibly could. I will admit this. I'm not exactly sure what it was that I watched. I know that I will most likely never watch it again, I know that it was well made and had an effect on me, and I know that it was definitely extreme. The film is full of screaming, shrieking, mutilation, and torture, and there was a story and people did things. However, this is a film that is entirely inaccessible for most audiences. In terms of Extreme French Horror films, I thought it was very good. Inside, to me, is still the crowning champion of Extreme French Horror films, but Martyrs definitely works. However, it's far more than just a Horror film. It's a celebration of extreme human suffering, cruelty, and evil.

I think the best way to watch Martyrs is to go into the movie cold. I purposely avoided any reviews that appeared to contain spoilers and read very little about the film before viewing it. Say what you will about the movie, but it takes several truly wild plot turns and part of what I enjoyed about the film is the unpredictability. In the end though, I felt like the narrative was disjointed, the themes weren't fully fleshed out, and ultimately the ideas behind Martyrs struck me as the armature on which to support several scenes of cartoon horror violence followed by sadistic torture.On the plus side, the movie is extremely stylish and I thought the gore effects were very good. There are several familiar elements in the film but they're combined in such a disjointed way that it never becomes stale. Martyrs is certainly one of the more original horror films I've seen in recent years. The direction and acting were excellent for this kind of movie. Even though I felt manipulated at the end of the movie I couldn't help but find the last 15 minutes or so to be strangely moving. I'll never want to watch this movie again but I haven't stopped thinking about it since viewing it last week.Now, the bad part: Martyrs really does feel like two different films that both go on for too long and don't mesh together tonally. The first half of the film at first seems to have a supernatural element and the violence is cartoonish and somewhat over-the-top. After the initial shooting though, I thought the film stopped dead in its tracks for a good 10-15 minutes while we watch Marie wailing around and cutting herself. This got a bit dull.The second half of the film is potentially more interesting but far less entertaining. The cult shows up and Anna is imprisoned and tortured. Watching a seemingly typical nuclear family get blasted across the room by a shotgun is fun. Watching a woman forced to sit in her own waste, take periodic beatings to the face, and have her skin surgically removed, isn't "fun." The torture scenes went on for too long and way too grim and distasteful to be enjoyable.I'm not a prude. I loved (and own) High Tension, Sheitan, Frontier(s), Inside, The Ordeal, etc. I've seen and enjoyed a lot of movies with some seriously rough content. I just personally think a horror film either needs to be harmless escapism OR, if the idea is to strike a realistic tone, the ideas supporting the film need to somewhat justify the graphic violence on-screen.For this viewer, Martyrs missed the mark. Maybe it's because the Madmoiselle only appears on screen for a few brief scenes, but the cult aspects of the film didn't come across to me at all, so I had a hard time reading this movie as a critique on religious cultism. Martyrs actually seemed to justify their world-view, since the film clearly implies that Anna DID have a vision and one of her tormentors treats her with compassion near the end, which suggests to me that they're not pure evil and somewhat justified what they were doing to the poor girl.Really, it just seemed to me that Martyrs was banking on scenes of young, attractive women in agony and all the religious mumbo-jumbo was an after-the-fact attempt at "depth" to let the audience off the hook. I found this insulting, just like the flimsy philosophical ideas in Irreversible ("Time destroys everything" -- ooh! That's deep!).I also think Martyrs opened itself wide open to charges of sexism. At least Hostel had the good sense to have both male and female victims. Martyrs makes the weakest attempt to justify the fact that all its victims are young (and suspiciously good-looking) women. I could practically hear the screenwriter arguing, "See? Just because Martyrs consists of about 90 minutes of female self-mutilation, degradation and torture, that doesn't mean it's sexist!" Sorry folks, but I'm just not buying it. I expect garden variety misogyny in Friday the Thirteen but those movies don't ask me to take them seriously. If you want to make a deep philosophical point, you're going to have to ditch the cartoon violence and other horror tropes.Overall, Martyrs is well-made and intriguing but the ideology is a total mess and it's not a movie I ever want to see again. That said, I know horror geeks are going to love this one so I'd recommend it to the extreme movie crowd without reservation. Just don't expect a "masterpiece" - Martyrs is far from it.

Having missed the opportunity to catch this at the Midnight Madness showing in TIFF08, I decided to go against all stated horror movie rules and watched this today around midday at a complex in downtown Toronto.. It's difficult to know what to say about this movie really; like a birth or a death, you really have to experience it yourself and draw your own conclusions. What I will say is that as a committed horror freak, rare is the occasion when I tense up and watch a film contorted, somehow trying to protect myself from what I'm putting myself through.. It contains enough tough to see horror/gore to satisfy the bloodhounds (though it doesn't feel like another attempt to up the gore ante for the sake of it, thankfully) and then - if you can watch it and many couldn't - transcends the genre totally with a jaw-dropping final act which if you're interested in the human condition and the capacity for seemingly normal people to do incredibly bad things will have you asking questions for some time to come and recognising that when horror and ideas mesh successfully, the result can be breathtaking. Absolutely not enjoyable but there again if you go to see a horror flick at a film festival and you know beforehand that it originally received an X-certificate in France, kicking up an almighty stink in the process - well, you know that an open mind is the least you can bring to bear. With that in mind I would recommend Martyrs as a film of incredible tension, harrowing physical violence and indelible imagery; unsurprisingly, the director name-checked Dario Argento during the Q&A as a major influence in his youth and there is a clear and confident signature in the work which suggests some parallels can be made between the two film-makers. I loved this movie and for those who have already posted comments good, bad or indifferent (and I really can't imagine a neutral response!) I hope like myself you have come away with a genuine sense of having seen something the like of which we are unlikely to see for some time..

I've heard a lot of buzz about this film over the years but took a long time to watch it. I'm not a huge fan of extremism and this has always been billed as "one of the most disturbing horror films ever" so I put it off until I felt like I was ready. I've gotta say I ended up kind of underwhelmed.The film starts off strong. It is relentless, hits us hard with themes of trauma and its persistence in one's life. The story structure in the first 2 acts was a breath of fresh air. I feel like I can typically predict where the story will go in many films but found myself continuously surprised. It's super intense in terms of the violence, yes, but it all seemed to be serving to tell a poignant story.Then we hit the last act...and the reveal of the antagonists and their motivation was so boring. Then it was just 30 minutes of people beating the crap out of a woman. This isn't unique, this isn't poignant. It's just...sad and frankly boring as far as story structure goes. The ending tries to end on a cerebral note but was just not interesting or thought provoking to me. It frankly just seemed like lazy writing. I ultimately feel like the first 2 acts of the film alone would have made for a better movie.Overall, yes, one of the more brutal films I've seen. I respect it for the boundaries it pushes while trying to have some substance. However the substance that could've been ultimately fizzled out and I was left feeling like this could've been something more memorable.

I often wonder how much further the horror genre can and will evolve in terms of sadism and the portrayal of ultra-explicit violence. Especially the youngest generation of French directors appear to be involved in some sort of sport competition where each one aspires to surpass the other when it comes to showing sheer brutality and stomach-churning sickness. "High Tension", released in 2003, was quite extreme already, but since then there came "Them", "Frontier(s)" and "Inside" and each separate film raised the bar every time. Now, after experiencing the nearly indescribable intensity level of "Martyrs", I sincerely hope that no other movie will ever go beyond the standards set in this film. "Martyrs" genuinely is an astonishing and jaw-dropping ordeal that is guaranteed to leave even the most hardened and trained horror buffs speechless. From what I gathered reading reviews and listening to opinions left and right, I already knew this wasn't going to be picnic, but the truth is that absolutely nothing can prepare you for what you are about to see in "Martyrs". It may sound a little fantastic, but the infamous and supposedly nauseating torture porn titles such as "Saw", "Hostel" and "Murder-Set-Pieces" look like sophomoric episodes of Sesame Street in comparison with the recent stream of French shock-features and in particular with "Martyrs".Okay, I realize I've been going on and on about the shocking impact and extreme violence of "Martyrs", but still I haven't even mentioned the most remarkable and praiseworthy aspect about the entire film. The gore, barbarity and mayhem aren't at all gratuitous or exploitative but actually serve a purpose! There were other and far more mundane "extreme" horror movies simply showcase a long series of torture sequences, "Martyrs" practically causes you to experience the pain AND simultaneously raises a handful of socially engaging debates. For once, the title of a horror movie can be taken 100% literally By watching "Martyrs", you expose yourself to martyrdom. You voluntarily watch the film and you're free to look away or step out of the theater at any given moment, but most likely you won't because subconsciously you are in readiness to endure a whole lot of visual suffering in order to know how the movie will end. Yes, it all does sound very philosophical and pseudo-intellectual (especially for a horror movie), but honestly not a single word is exaggerated. This movie honestly is the genre landmark of a new generation The synopsis on the back of the DVD appears to give away the content of the entire film, but in fact it only covers the first ten minutes. The short summary describes how a 12-year-old girl narrowly escapes from an abandoned factory site where she was held captive and subjected to extreme torture. She ends up in a psychiatric clinic and befriends another girl who slowly helps her processing the trauma. 15 years later, the girl appears on the doorstep of a seemingly happy family of four with a shotgun in her hands and raging fury in her eyes. Lucie is convinced she found her tormentors. Apart perhaps from the domestic household element, this sounds like the plot of nearly every "revengesploitation" movie ever made. But these are only the opening minutes What follows next is a literally perplexing and excruciating visual nightmare that is unpredictable and even unimaginable. At first you'll wonder where writer/director Pascal Laugier can possibly be heading for with his screenplay, and then you'll probably wish you never asked. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, so let me just re-establish that you will be unprepared and stupefied. Do you dare?

This movie started great but turned into a confusing and disgusting mess. I wanted to like it because it was a very well made movie, but at some points, the plot made absolutely no sense. It definitely kept me entertained through the whole movie, but at some points I felt like they were trying too hard. I genuinely liked it at first, but then it just turned into torture p*rn. There wasn't much of a plot and I feel like it was just made for the shock value. I appreciate this movie for being the only movie to disturb me this much. I loved disturbing movies similar to this, but this was just far too much. I wanted to like this movie, but I just can't

...and what we're ultimately allowed to witness is, at its core, some pretty empty-headed, although visceral, existentially sadistic nonsense. Nonetheless, I can't deny that "Martyrs" packs a punch (several of them, in fact, to the face and gut, repeatedly, to its protagonist, after fooling us about who the real protagonist is). It's ultra-violence that Alex and his droogies would lap up like synthemesc milk-plus; presumably the audience is meant to as well. Aha, but auteur Pascal "The Tall Man" Laugier isn't through with us yet! After rubbing our collective noses in viscous pools of vengeance and hallucinatory blood guilt, he dials up the sadism a few more notches with a tiresome third act that trucks in absurdist fantasies of an elite cabal searching for proof of an afterlife through the inducement of a tortured martyr's vision of what can only be feebly represented by a coruscating white light.What tripe.Neither the acting chops of the two leads, which are considerable, nor the overall production values, including some very convincing Grand Guignol splatter and grue, can conceal the vacuous conceit of the film's plot nor the soul-less nihilism of its theme. "Martyrs" leaves its audience numbed by its brutality, but with precious little else, and ultimately comes off as mere torture-porn with a glib pretension of meaning. I won't say it's not worth watching, but be prepared to be unsatisfied. Mayhaps that was Laugier's intent; if so, his intentions were shallow and venal.

Making its Stateside debut, Pascal Laugier's "Martyrs" was the grand finale to a spectacular constellation of fine horror films. "Martyrs" however, is not like a "SAW" or "HOSTEL" in which there are creative forms of torture served for your viewing pleasure, this film has an art house feel to it that leads into the bowels of depravity. It's demonstrates how evil man can be for the share pleasure of scientific research. It reminded me of a brochure that I received depicting the horrors of how animals are slaughtered for human consumption. If that is a brochure you'd rather not digest before dinner, "Martyrs" is the type of film you may not want to view on a full stomach. Brilliantly executed in ways better described only as experimental, Pascal Laugier takes us to the end of the tunnel, the last stop, to a place where there is no longer any separation between humans and animals, predators or prey, it' a place so dark, you will no longer have to imagine for now it has been recorded on celluloid. All the "SAW" or "HOSTEL" or any other torture porn created to date has nothing on "Martyrs". Why? Because they French know their cinema business like no other. They leave nothing up to the imagination and nothing is too taboo for them whereas here in America, filmmakers tend to like to draw certain lines when it comes to making horror films for shock value. "Martyrs" is one of the few crossover films that could play at a horror film festival, as well as a intellectually artsy festival or a gay & lesbian festival alike. It covers the gamut in storytelling and that is what makes this film so powerful and so inherently haunting ,it will carve many putrid memories in your phsyque long after viewing. I would not recommend this film to folks with weak stomachs.

I wouldn't consider myself someone who dislike excessive gore/violence/torture. I love Hostile, Cannibal Holocaust and I think Green Inferno was pretty good.But to me a horror movie that has excessive gore has to be doing it for a purpose: to scare, to make social commentary, or just to amuse (in the case of green inferno)Martyr seems to be torture for repulsions sake which I am against. Like August Mordum Requiem, I don't care for movie that's showing me realistic torture just to disturb me.It's not really scary and more just disgusting.It's just EXCESSIVE with the torture and at the end all they throw on it is an ambiguous ending that doesn't really make the slog through the torture worth it.Although I liked the ending, and do think about it from time to time, it was one of the ONLY parts I liked about the movie.If I were to re-watch it I would only watch the ending. And that to me is a bad sign.I don't want to be the person who gives a movie a bad review because it's "too graphic" but I will be the guy who gives it a bad review because the movie is just glorified torture porn, with only a "okay" ending that offers very little in terms of commentary/thought provoking, but just enough to give it a 7.The ending is the only thing that saves this movie for me, and even than it's just one of those half assed *the writer couldn't think of a good enough answer to the questions he asked so he just left them un-answered" cop-out ending.Watch this movie if you want to see realistic torture. If you expect more out of a film than just watch a youtube video explaining the plot. (isn't really much to explain, because the writer clearly didn't have an answer so he left it a mystery)

A young girl named Lucie escapes from a hellish nightmare of torture and depravity. She meets a friend, Anna, who stands by her as the two grow up. But Lucie's scars are mental as well as physical and 15 years after her escape, she seeks revenge on her captors. Anna is soon dragged into the situation and what she finds makes her own abusive childhood seem like a walk in the park.I love horror movies. I like many movies that have been lumped into the "torture porn" category (even though I hate that term) and I like horror movies that can disturb me and make me think with barely an ounce of gore. But I felt more manipulated than moved by Martyrs. The story of Lucie getting revenge on her abusers and dealing with the scars of her past while unraveling the mystery of her capture could have made for an interesting movie, but the Lucie part is over fairly quickly. And I don't really want to give too much away but the Anna part of the story seems to go out of its way to be needlessly "unpleasant" for a motive that just didn't work on me. I appreciate the movie for trying to be different (and succeeding at that) but in the end, I was bored, frustrated, and disappointed.ff
