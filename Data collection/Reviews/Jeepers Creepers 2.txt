2 years after the surprising success of "Jeepers Creepers", Victor Salva returns with a sequel that continues where the original left. Although at first reluctant to making a sequel, Salva crafts a competent horror film that continues exploring the formula of the supernatural hunter in the desolated rural setting. Despite having the obvious flaws of a minor sequel, "Jeepers Creepers II" is a worthy follow up that has its own share of tricks to keep the fans happy.The plot of the film follows a school bus of a local high school that just won the championship and are on their way back home. To their misfortune, the Creeper (Jonathan Breck) is one the loose as he is on the final day of his 23 days eating cycle, so this ruthless hunter will do whatever is necessary to find food before his time runs out. But the Creeper has another problem, he is being hunted down by Jack Taggart (Ray Wise) the father of one of his victims who is looking for revenge.While it lacks the originality of the first one, "Jeepers creepers II" has a more focused and consistent plot due to the fact that the Creeper is now an identifiable villain. Victor Salva's new tale of rural horror is now a full-fledged supernatural horror in the vein of Wes Craven's "A Nightmare on Elm Street", where typical elements of Americana become sources of horror. Having most of the movie set inside of the school bus with the cast's fears and personalities clashing makes a good source for classic suspense and tension between characters.Visually, the film is a step forward and showcases that deep down the obvious commercial intentions of this film, Salva is still an artist that has a great eye for visual compositions. His camera-work does miracles both in and out of the school bus (the movie's main location) and he captures the lovely and scary things about rural North America. The visual effects of the film are not as good as in the first one, but they are still effective and the CGI is not that dominant.The young cast does a fine job and the overall performance is not as poor as one could expect. However, they are nothing spectacular and some seem to had been chosen based more on looks rather than talent. The two veterans of the movie are where talent is. Jonathan Breck and Ray Wise give the film soul as the opposite forces who are destined to clash. Breck is quite good as the Creeper and looks more comfortable in the role now; Wise on the other hand, is a scene stealer and he owns the film every time he is on screen."Jeepers Creepers II" has a lot of what's good about modern horror movies, but sadly, it carries also some of the worst. The fast packed action at times gets distracting and contrasts badly with Salva's honest attempts to create suspense and atmosphere. There is an apparent effort in developing characters and while in some cases it works, in others it terribly fails (due mostly to the actor's lack of talent). also, it is fair to point out that the movie lacks the scares of the first one as it has more in common with the final part of it. It is great fun and entertainment, but if scares are what you are looking, better look elsewhere.To summarize, the film is an entertaining and very well-directed scary movie that makes a worthy sequel to the original one. Victor Salva's second part of the series is a good addition if you liked the first one, otherwise it will be just another teen horror movie. Personally I liked it, but it would be wiser to rent it first. 6.5/10

More elaborate sequel to the effective monster movie of 2001, "Jeepers Creepers II" is more about action than anything else. It's definitely not as creepy (although it does have its spooky moments) and since we now know a fair bit about the Creeper, the mystery element is gone. This story takes place on the last day of the Creeper's feeding cycle, a few days after the events of the first film. A basketball team is returning from a championship game, and the Creeper, after snatching a kid away from his farmer father, tails the teams' bus, crippling it by ruining the tires with something akin to a ninja's throwing stars. It proceeds to decimate the coaching staff & the bus driver, and then terrorize the teens, making sure they can't escape. It's true enough that there are many points in the script with which a viewer can take issue - even yours truly had a hard time buying some of them, and he's a pretty forgiving person. Things tend to get particularly muddled when it comes to the big climax as the teens finally leave the bus, and we wonder where they all get to from scene to scene. It does take a lot of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie, but if one can accomplish this, "Jeepers Creepers II" does reward us with some exciting moments and some extremely amusing money shots. For one thing, it's a total hoot to see the Creeper forced to regenerate certain body parts. It gets a LOT more damage done to it this time around; it's good to see various assorted characters be able to fight back. Particularly interesting is the vengeance-obsessed farmer Jack Taggart (veteran character actor Ray Wise ("RoboCop", 'Twin Peaks') getting a rare case of top billing), who fashions some killing implements using his post puncher. Naturally, due to there being a greater number of characters this time around, they don't get fleshed out too much, although writer / director Victor Salva tries to give the material some meat by introducing an element of racism. Overall, this suffers the same fate as many sequels, lacking the originals' freshness and in truth it doesn't give the viewer too many people for whom they can really root. At least it allows Justin Long to reprise his Darry character from the first film, appearing in ghostly form to offer warnings and information to one of the characters here. Nothing especially good, but not bad either; fortunately, one thing it's not is boring. Seven out of 10.

Decent follow-up to Jeepers Creepers takes place just days after the original. The story focuses on a group of athletic high school kids (a varsity team along with their coaches and cheerleaders), who are on their way home when they get stranded in the middle of nowhere after their bus breaks down. They soon come to the terrifying realization that it wasn't an accident, and that they're all being hunted by a meticulous monster who's in the midst of a timely feeding frenzy. At times exciting, with more than enough violence and effective scares make this good fun if you're willing to pardon the annoyingly one-note characters and banal dialogue. **½

Not since the early days of Wes Craven thrillers have we had a really good fright flick to scare us in true Halloween fashion. This one does the trick thanks to some extra good CGI effects and some scary situations in the middle of a deserted countryside where teens find themselves menaced by a winged creature determined to make them his flesh-eating victims.In the only adult role, RAY WISE does a convincing job of making it all look reasonable enough to swallow--and it owes a lot of its punch to the imaginative tales of authors like Stephen King. There are no standout performances among the various teens, but all of them look incredibly afraid of the winged creature--with good reason. The make-up job here is marvelously chilling.The story is the stuff dreams are made of--or rather, nightmares. And it's all done with extremely clever build-up of suspense as the teens, one by one, become divisive and challenge each other in ways that only undermine their vulnerability. A few of the scenes are very graphic in depicting the creature's stranglehold on his victims and not for the squeamish--or the young and impressionable.Recommended as a good fright flick, nothing more. But credit must be given to director Victor Salva for keeping the whole tale tense and taut with visual excitement.Summing up: An above average thriller of its kind. Jonathan Breck makes one scary Creeper.

Back in 2001, audiences were introduced to a creature which we came to understand fed every 23 years for 23 days.  Why?  Well, let's not worry about that.The movie was Jeepers Creepers, and I have to admit that I gave the first installment a mild thumbs up as there were some genuine frights and a villain that was as uniquely interesting as the first time Freddy Krueger reached from under Johnny Depp's bed.  It wasn't a movie that I would tell friends and family to fork over $13 bucks for to see on the big screen, but for a late, rainy Saturday evening, one could do worse.Well, skip ahead two years, and the moderate success of the first installment brought back writer/director, Victor Salva to continue the story of the feeding creature in the crops.  I imagined Victor sitting at his word processor and thinking aloud to himself, `Hmmm.  Ok  The creature feeds every 23 years and it has only been two since the last movie, so we better not dwell too much on that topic. Ok For a sequel we need a bigger body count and sexier stars so lets have a full school bus of ballplayers and cheerleaders stranded and being picked off one by one.  Ok. We need to recognize the first film and show continuity so lets have the main actor from Jeepers Creepers I appear in the sequel.  Oh wait I killed him off.  Ok. Let's have him back in a dream sequence.  Yeah!  That'll work!  Ok. Last thing to worry about is trying to give the creature new characteristics while still making him vulnerable.  I got it!  Let's have him lose his head in one scene and replace it with one of the heads of the school children.  Excellent.  And then let's top off the thrills with having a vengeful father who creates a weapon that will ultimately destroy the creature.  Got it!  Good to go!'I doubt I am going verbatim with what might have been thought or said while trying to shop Jeepers Creepers 2, but I don't think I am straying too far from the truthful facts either. Jeepers Creepers 2 does offer more victims a la every horror sequel and most of the male characters are unbelievable brats that like to get their screen time without their shirts on. They run around uttering such ridiculous dialogue as `We have just dropped a notch on the food chain, man' while showing no signs of protecting he females they lust after so much within their own group. Jeepers Creepers 2 had double the budget as did the first, so it is not surprising that the creature gets more computer generated close-ups or scenes where he flies around picking off his victims at will (Didn't he drive a truck in the first one?).   However, instead of this developing the evil being, it desensitizes us and quite frankly, I was as bored of him as I was of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees after their second kick at the can. 
For horror fans, I still expect that this film was a bit of a disappointment.  The characters were so annoying that you found yourself routing for the creature and as far as beatings go, the creature was stabbed, decapitated, speared, impaled and thrown through a windshield all to no avail.  Where is the tension therefore if a creature is virtually indestructible?  www.gregsrants.com

Jeepers Creepers II (2003) for me is not nearly as good of a story as the first film but it has a few scares and lots of campy humor. This is one of those films where you will find yourself cheering on the monster and not cheer-leading on the side of all those annoying jocks. Instead of hoping there is a way that (most of) the group can survive you will find yourself yelling at the screen "Get all the jocks Creeper!".No this is not a good movie but it is very entertaining and it might get quite a few laughs out of you. Watch this movie for the humor factor and not the horror factor. Jeepers Creepers II (2003) is not a comedy horror but works well with that genre be cause it's more on the funny side and not on the creepy side.I would have rated this movie a 5.5 but it gets a 7 from me for making me laugh.7/10

"Jeepers Creepers 2" is an unnecessary sequel that just rehashes the plot of Part 1 - this time focusing on a group of teenagers who get stranded on a bus. Not much else going on here folks...This reviewer liked the first "Jeepers Creepers" much better. It had better acting, plot, and character development going for it. The sequel is somewhat fun if your a big fan of the original movie- but ultimately lacks everything that made the first film a winner.With nothing new or exciting about "Jeepers Creepers 2", this can be viewed as an O.K. movie at best.

Sequel to the terrific 2001 horror film is a wildly fun ride, even if it doesn't quite live up to the chilling original.On the final evening of his annual feeding, the Creeper terrorizes a bus load of students, while a local farmer is looking for some revenge.While it may lack some of the unique elements of the original film (like the Creeper's truck, the title song, etc.) this sequel is still a highly-energized and occasionally spooky thriller. There's plenty of action, impressive makeup FX, moments of gruesome humor, and tightening suspense to drive it. Once again Salva delivers good directorial touches and an entertaining story.The cast, headed by veteran actor Ray Wise, is good. Especially good are the relatively unknown young stars Nenninger, Aycox, Schiffner, Brown, Hammond, and Delfino. Breck returns as the Creeper and is creepier than ever.While Jeepers Creepers 2 is never as scary as its predecessor it is a very entertaining sequel.*** out of ****

then this is it. I liked the first film, but all the suspense was left out of this one. The first one started off great with the creepy truck sneaking up on the car. This sequel never even comes close to having any suspense like that.In this, the Creeper targets a school bus on his last night to feed. The creeper is constantly shown in full view, so that removes any suspense there. Plus, he doesn't kill anyone in a gruesome way like in the first. So, most of the film is spent with all these high school kids on the bus and all they do is argue about stupid stuff. One boy with a bad attitude, Scottie, is just rude and blames everyone else and just wants to kick people off the bus. We know what his fate will be. Then the story with Minxie is what is so illogical. For no reason, she becomes this psychic and knows all about the Creeper and how he smells people out to devour. So ridiculous. Then the last part with the final chase and how the Creeper is eventually "killed" was very bad. They even used a bad CGI version of a sky that had too many stars.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth watching, even if you are a huge horror fan.

I'm one of those rare people who thinks that this - the sequel to the original 'Jeepers Creepers' is actually better than the first one. The original film was too irritating due to its central characters never really bothered to *properly* escape the 'Creeper' (aka a giant half man/half bat monster with a taste for human bodyparts). However, here we have a central scenario which lends itself better to the situation.A schoolbus full of teenagers gets stranded (with a little help from the Creeper himself) in the middle of nowhere, now the flying bat out of hell can take his pick of their tender, young, tasty bodies for him to consume and regenerate.However, all is not lost for our prepubescent Creeper-fodder, for a local father (played by the typically brooding and sinister Ray Wise, of Twin Peaks and Dead End fame) lost his young son to the Creeper recently and has sworn to track it down and exact some gruesome revenge (with a little help from a pneumatic harpoon).Although most of the action is centred on the (pretty unlikeable) bus-load of teens, there is plenty of gruesome gore and nastiness as the Creeper picks them off one by one.Personally, I would have preferred Ray Wise to be in it more, as he's clearly the best part of the film, but it's still an enjoyable little horror flick nonetheless.

"Jeepers Creepers 2" is a hilarious sequel to the hit comedy "Jeepers Creepers" from 2001. Oh, wait. It's supposed to be horror? Oh, Jesus, we're in trouble then.In that case, this movie sucks. Really badly. The plot is explained by a teenager in distress, people are flat (the best acting comes from the nerdy bill gates wannabe towel boy who practically vomited out his lines, leaving the audience i saw it with in stitches.)The whole audience was laughing at all the right points, making me believe that this was just a send-up, a spoof, of horror movies. Didn't "Scary Movie" fish that lake dry? That's when I discovered it was supposed to be scary.You know the deal. A group of homosexual basketball stars are returning home from a successful championship, when the creeper, this big gooey guy with a vagina on his nose starts eating them all. Pretty soon, its up to farmer joe to harpoon the guy, finally killing him for another 23 years.I don't get it, I don't get the 23 thing. Everything's 23. The 23rd spring of the 23rd year for 23 days, the creeper eats people. Why? Why is he doing this? Just because? Well, in that case, I guess I'll be kidnapping small girls now, BECAUSE I CAN.I wished someone would explain to me how this is scary or exciting. Everything's predictable, so much so that it was funny. 1/10.PS Please note that I do NOT kidnap small children, nor do I condone doing so. You sick freaks.

If a film is successful, then it must be tempting to simply offer a second helping. It is therefore creditable of the Jeepers Creepers crew to go for an ensemble piece of the "Who is going to live and who is going to die?" variety for the Creeper's second outing.Good points - the Creeper himself, the disgusting head replacement sequence, the level of tension maintained throughout, and the ending.The main bad point - and it's a biggie - is that the students stuck in the bus are all so thoroughly obnoxious that I din't care about any of them surviving. I found myself rooting for the Creeper, and hoping that he would polish most of them off.Even so, this is a pretty reasonable sequel.

...watching this film.I was quite enamoured with the original as I felt that it was a breath of fresh air amongst all the usual teeny slashers that have been about for the past few years. There was no guessing who was doing it, you knew who (if not exactly what) was responsible. In a nutshell, I had high hopes for a sequel (obviously something that you should never have!).It was, in my personal opinion, terrible. Not especially creepy, no story line as such and characters that you felt nothing for. A bunch of school kids (how original) and a vengeful father, I was actually glad when they died as you didn't have to watch them anymore.The only spooky bit was in the cornfield at the very beginning, after that it was downhill all the way. Who lives, who dies, who cares?

As a kid, Jeepers Creepers 2 and I have some fond memories. I remember watching it on premium cable and loving it. I bought the DVD and watched it a couple more times after that. I was in love with the film and everything about it. But like all childhood movies, we must fess up and admit it, usually, they're not too great. This one is no exception. The suspense is there, the setting as well, but technical errors and idiotic characters plague this film.The errors in this film are wide, but I picked out a few that I found out without looking at sites that spoil them. If this is supposed to be spring, why is the corn dead? It should be sprouting and just beginning to grow. The Creeper is supposed to only kill a certain type of people, you'll see, but the first three killed on the bus do not fall into this category. Not to mention, why are there only three cheerleaders on the entire bus? Where are the parents? And why is this supposedly long rode called "East 9" vacant? So many question - zero answers. I wasn't even trying to pick out flaws. It was inevitable after twenty minutes I kept noticing more and more.Despite all the flaws, I hate to admit, I liked Jeepers Creepers 2. It brought back vivid memories of late nights when I stayed up to watch this. It picks up four days after the first with a bus full of happy teenagers returning home after winning their basketball championship. When the bus gets a flat, they check the tire and pursue on before blowing another tire which strands them on a road called East 9.Three faculty members are taken abruptly by the winged creature known as "The Creeper" (Breck) who comes out every twenty three years for twenty three days and takes random people to feast on. He needs their external/internal organs the humans provide to function for himself (if he eats an eye, he can see, etc). The leader of the pack when the faculty is dead is the game bench-warmer Scotty (Nenninger). Scotty tries to develop plans to keep the group alive till morning. Since this is the last day of his feast, he scurries to find people to collect.The scares in the film are there. Not full force, but they are present. The whole suspense and uneasy feel is brought back from the original. You're with a group of teenagers, all your same age, stuck on a bus in the middle of nowhere. Cell phone reception is obsolete and no one is answering the CB radio in the bus. It has a certain camp factor, and really utilizes its setting well.I still am completely fond of "The Creeper" character, and would like to see Johnathan Breck come back for the open, yet not filmed, Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral. Something about a winged, cloaked inhumane figure swooping down, grabbing someone by his claws, and flying back up in the air just really entertains me. It's got a very well made creep factor to it. Like an old fifties/sixties horror film.Jeepers Creepers 2 is far from perfect. It doesn't capture every element, and doesn't live up to the first film, but really keeps the tonality of sudden, unsuspecting terror going in the sequel. Director Victor Salva wants to get the ball rolling on the third installment. My advice, keep the scares fierce and the action consistent. We don't have to end the franchise on an abrupt, obscure note.Starring: Johnathan Breck, Ray Wise, Luke Edwards, and Eric Nenninger. Directed by: Victor Salva.

If you compare this one to the first movie, it wouldn't be fare. The first one was million times better horror movie than this movie is. This is just a franchise to suck up our money.One thing I quite impress is the used of Justin, after all he's dead in the first but how come he is in this second movie. So that the reason I watch this second installment. And he fool me bad, I should have seen it coming. This one there nothing into it just a bunch of kids running and screaming and get angry at each other. Ordinary kids won't sell so they used jocks and cheerleaders to do so. Anyway it not all that bad, the movie is pretty entertaining and you will know what happen what happen to the creepers on exact 23 days come to an end.Recommendation: Yes. But if you big fan of first one don't, it might ruin your imagination.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: C-)

Jeepers Creepers II is much better movie then the first one ever was and i think is the best one of the two! Here we find out more about the Creeper like who he is, what is he want's. Better story then was in first one, high school kids on corn field. Part 2 is the best one of the Creeper. I was also reading about Gina Philips that she declined offers to reprise her role as Trish Jenner in sequel but i'm so glad that Justin Long did return in this movie as Darry Jenner when he warned Minxie Hayes what is going to happened to her and her friends and what has happened to him. Ray Wise did great job as Jack Taggart Sr. getting revenge on Creeper for kidnapping his younger son. Great story, plot, writing and acting i was really surprised with this movie. The best one of the two. I still don't understand why people don't like this movie, criticizing and saying not better then the first one or first one is the best? You don't have a taste in movies. What did you except that is going to be like 1st one a copy of the movie? What's wrong with you? Part 2 beats the first one and you can't say it was the worst one when it was not! You don't understand this movie if you leave complain about it!OK the story set after the first one Creeper: Stranded on a lonely road, a school bus full of high school basketball players, their coaches, and cheerleaders must defend themselves from the Creeper - a flesh-eating ancient beast that resurfaces on the earth every 23 years to feed. Meanwhile, a farmer and his son set out on a personal mission to hunt the Creeper down.Schoolbus tire's got flat on a lonely road full of high school kids who are returning home from there basketball game. Minxie Hayes a cheerleader got a vision from Darry from the first movie that they are stuck on a lonely road because of Creeper and the flat tire wasn't an accident it was a set up. Now this kids are facing with new terror in the night a flesh-eating ancient beast that resurfaces on the earth every 23 years to feed. They are all his food now they have to defend them self's. Meanwhile, a farmer and his son set out on a personal mission to hunt the Creeper down Jack Taggart Sr. and his son Jack Taggart Jr. are out for revenge when Creeper kidnapped and took their own younger son now they wan't revenge and those kids find them self on the way, so they are trying to help them and destroy the Creeper once and for all. At the end of movie they stopped him and capture him. Awesome movie much much better then first one. Btw Trish Jenner was really hot in the first movie. I love this movie i have part I on DVD i wish i could got this movie part II on DVD too. I also hear they are planing to filming part 3 aka.. Jeepers Creepers III : Cathedral (2013) which set's events after their first movie ended and both of character's Trish Jenner and Jack Taggart Sr. come's back in third movie. Just why? Also Trish Jenner is now powerful and rich but why? If they going to do the same plot with the same characters they are going to ruined this sequel movie. Gina Philips turned down the role for her character Trish Jenner why will she come back to get revenge, she didn't wanna come back in part II why now? Gina Philips is a loser so i would rather put some other actress to play her character.Gina Philips didn't make that character: writer,producer and director did! So she should shut the hell up because she's a crappy actress and she's not even famous at all. Nicki Aycox as Minxie Hayes should return back. Nicki Aycox is amazing actress she even played in sequel Joy Ride 2:Dead Ahead that fallowed from the first movie with Paul Walker. I love this movie and i recommend you to watched on DVD or TV is awesome movie beat's first one. I gave 10 out of 10

"Jeepers Creepers 2" trades the familiarity of creeping tension for in the face, well timed action sequences. Where it doesn't work so much as a straight horror thriller this time around, what with nothing new to be discovered about the startling "Creeper", returning director/writer Victor Salva ups the ante on the gore and stylized action, resulting in an enjoyable monster movie that doesn't skimp out on the bloodshed audiences would expect from a horror sequel, especially one that has to live up to such a frightening experience as the first film. "Creepers 2" jumps into the action as quickly as the first film did, and the Creeper is even more of an unsettling creation in this second chapter. He was dusty and ancient looking in the first film, here the makeup artists have had a field day and we can tell the creature has done a lot of feeding. Throw a diverse group of students on a cramped school bus that conveniently breaks down in the middle of nowhere, right in Creeper territory, and you've got a typical sequel that may not score points for originality but proves to be a great vehicle for suspense and graphic, shocking imagery. Salva keeps the plot (except the Creeper himself) at a reasonably believable boiling point, drawing an interweaving story between the group of kids trapped in the bus, their collective psychosis breaking down as the Creeper terrorizes them and picks them off one by one, and a toughened old farmer who's out for vengeance against the demon. Salva wraps it up in a neat package that stops just shy of wearing out its welcome and Bennet Salvay's rich score leavens the scares wonderfully throughout. Not as scary or original as the first, but a worthy and creepy effort nonetheless, with some riveting scares and decent performances from all involved. Where'd you get those peepers? Keep an eye out for the really great horror makeup effects, they stand out and give "Jeepers Creepers 2" some of its nastiest energy.

Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003): Dir: Victor Salva / Cast: Ray Wise, Eric Nenninger, Nicki Aycox, Garikayi Mutambirwa, Luke Edwards: Every bit as stupid as the original and it is filled with characters that are about as bright as a pile of cow dung. The creeper apparently feeds every 23 years and in the opening scene it makes off with a boy that thought it was a scarecrow. His father and brother make chase and are surprised when it takes flight. Cut ahead to a bus load of moron football playing teenagers who become stranded when a boney object is found embedded in one of the tires. Before long the adults are snagged leaving the teenagers to bicker while the creeper places them on the lunch menu. They use the bus radio to call for help and it is overheard by the farmer in the film's opening who arms his truck with a harpoon. Stupid and irritable showcasing special effects and mayhem. Directed by Victor Salva who made the very stupid first movie as well as another annoying piece of sh*t called Powder. Ray Wise at least is putting in a reasonable effort as the farmer who is aiming for revenge and justice against the creature who violated his family. Luke Edwards plays the older brother of the first victim who witnesses the attack in the film's opening. The teenagers unfortunately have more air in their heads than a hot air balloon. The bus should be driven over this senseless junk. Score: 2 ½ / 10

Honestly, with the onslaught of low budget horror flicks in the past few years - yes, even the good ones - rewatching JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 was a breath of fresh air. Simply put, they don't make 'em like they used to anymore. A mid-range budget ($19 million!) creature feature with fantastic practical effects, great lighting, above average cinematography, and it doesn't even take place in a house! You can feel a grand scale to this film, something that's uncommon in many modern horror movies these days.It's also one of those rare action/horror pics that's equal parts exciting and scary. Obvious thought was put into the way the film's made and some of its more ingenious set pieces - like the Creeper's wing separating the bus in half - so yeah, I pretty much think JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 is incredibly fun and underrated as hell. And yes, it's superior to the first film in almost every way.

2 years after the surprising success of "Jeepers Creepers", Victor Salva returns with a sequel that continues where the original left. Although at first reluctant to making a sequel, Salva crafts a competent horror film that continues exploring the formula of the supernatural hunter in the desolated rural setting. Despite having the obvious flaws of a minor sequel, "Jeepers Creepers II" is a worthy follow up that has its own share of tricks to keep the fans happy.The plot of the film follows a school bus of a local high school that just won the championship and are on their way back home. To their misfortune, the Creeper (Jonathan Breck) is one the loose as he is on the final day of his 23 days eating cycle, so this ruthless hunter will do whatever is necessary to find food before his time runs out. But the Creeper has another problem, he is being hunted down by Jack Taggart (Ray Wise) the father of one of his victims who is looking for revenge.While it lacks the originality of the first one, "Jeepers creepers II" has a more focused and consistent plot due to the fact that the Creeper is now an identifiable villain. Victor Salva's new tale of rural horror is now a full-fledged supernatural horror in the vein of Wes Craven's "A Nightmare on Elm Street", where typical elements of Americana become sources of horror. Having most of the movie set inside of the school bus with the cast's fears and personalities clashing makes a good source for classic suspense and tension between characters.Visually, the film is a step forward and showcases that deep down the obvious commercial intentions of this film, Salva is still an artist that has a great eye for visual compositions. His camera-work does miracles both in and out of the school bus (the movie's main location) and he captures the lovely and scary things about rural North America. The visual effects of the film are not as good as in the first one, but they are still effective and the CGI is not that dominant.The young cast does a fine job and the overall performance is not as poor as one could expect. However, they are nothing spectacular and some seem to had been chosen based more on looks rather than talent. The two veterans of the movie are where talent is. Jonathan Breck and Ray Wise give the film soul as the opposite forces who are destined to clash. Breck is quite good as the Creeper and looks more comfortable in the role now; Wise on the other hand, is a scene stealer and he owns the film every time he is on screen."Jeepers Creepers II" has a lot of what's good about modern horror movies, but sadly, it carries also some of the worst. The fast packed action at times gets distracting and contrasts badly with Salva's honest attempts to create suspense and atmosphere. There is an apparent effort in developing characters and while in some cases it works, in others it terribly fails (due mostly to the actor's lack of talent). also, it is fair to point out that the movie lacks the scares of the first one as it has more in common with the final part of it. It is great fun and entertainment, but if scares are what you are looking, better look elsewhere.To summarize, the film is an entertaining and very well-directed scary movie that makes a worthy sequel to the original one. Victor Salva's second part of the series is a good addition if you liked the first one, otherwise it will be just another teen horror movie. Personally I liked it, but it would be wiser to rent it first. 6.5/10

I saw several negative comments here on IMDB and thought this movie would be one of those horror movies that was a real turkey.Fortunately, I took a chance Jeepers Creepers II anyway, and surprise, surprise, it was better than the majority thought.************Mild Spoilers Ahead***************************************I'll grant you, it's a formula teen horror movie, but it doesn't have all the plot holes in it that people complained about.  All the stuff about the kids getting out of the bus, the unlikeable characters, blah blah blah ad nauseum were overblown.  I found it much more entertaining than any of the Scream movies or the I Know What You Did Last Summer series. 
I liked the comment about it being a bit of a throwback to some of the old creature movies.  I thought the Creeper was great and he scared me throughout the film.  I'll take the man in the Creeper Suit over many of today's cheesey and usually boring CGI effects.  The person who played the creature did a great job and I loved the special effects in this move.  This probably isn't a classic movie, but I can truthfully say I enjoyed the special effects in it more than those in The Matrix, Spiderman with Tobey McGuire and the second X-Men movie, which were all about as exciting as watching paint dry.  CGI has to blend seamlessly and realistically into a move to make it work, and CGI just for CGI's sake doesn't impress movie lovers, just CGI freaks. I liked Jeepers Creepers II.  It was a fun horror flick to see at the theater.  Sure, it could have used a bit more character development, but that's my only gripe.  I rate it 7/10.  If you like teen horror flicks, I think you'll enjoy it.

I recently re-watched the first Jeepers Creepers and I don't really get why so many people seem to hate it. Sure, it had quite a disappointing climax and Victor Salva is an infamous figure in Hollywood but his visions did lead to one of the best horror films in the post-Scream era. And the same goes for part two! If you leave logic behind, this is quite an intense and well-elaborated scary movie. Opposite to most directors nowadays, Salva perfectly knows how to create suspenseful situations and emotional devastation. The Creeper (portrayed once again by Jonathan Breck) is a far-fetched new horror icon but it does bring terror in the most isolated outlands of America. This sequel takes place a few days after the original (of which the happenings can be heard on radio-broadcasts all the time) and features a bus full of high school jocks and cheerleaders terrorized by the Creeper. Judging by their fear's smell, he picks out victims to devour and to re-furnish his rotting corpse. Victor Salva makes great use of the 'surprise element'. All the characters in Jeepers Creepers are equally meaningless so you never really know who will get killed next. Even the most popular jock, the most innocent child or the cutest girl can die at any time and this results in an exiting drop-out race of which you don't want to miss a second. The film is not as gore as you might think and the stress is more laid on tension. Salva and his crew use the remote location to the fullest and the film contains eerie shots of wide cornfields and roads with no chance for shelter. The cast of young and inexperienced kids do a fairly good job. The only familiar face in Jeepers Creepers 2 is Ray Wise (from the cult series 'Twin Peaks'). This film will never be a classic but at least its entertaining horror without much pretension.

More elaborate sequel to the effective monster movie of 2001, "Jeepers Creepers II" is more about action than anything else. It's definitely not as creepy (although it does have its spooky moments) and since we now know a fair bit about the Creeper, the mystery element is gone. This story takes place on the last day of the Creeper's feeding cycle, a few days after the events of the first film. A basketball team is returning from a championship game, and the Creeper, after snatching a kid away from his farmer father, tails the teams' bus, crippling it by ruining the tires with something akin to a ninja's throwing stars. It proceeds to decimate the coaching staff & the bus driver, and then terrorize the teens, making sure they can't escape. It's true enough that there are many points in the script with which a viewer can take issue - even yours truly had a hard time buying some of them, and he's a pretty forgiving person. Things tend to get particularly muddled when it comes to the big climax as the teens finally leave the bus, and we wonder where they all get to from scene to scene. It does take a lot of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie, but if one can accomplish this, "Jeepers Creepers II" does reward us with some exciting moments and some extremely amusing money shots. For one thing, it's a total hoot to see the Creeper forced to regenerate certain body parts. It gets a LOT more damage done to it this time around; it's good to see various assorted characters be able to fight back. Particularly interesting is the vengeance-obsessed farmer Jack Taggart (veteran character actor Ray Wise ("RoboCop", 'Twin Peaks') getting a rare case of top billing), who fashions some killing implements using his post puncher. Naturally, due to there being a greater number of characters this time around, they don't get fleshed out too much, although writer / director Victor Salva tries to give the material some meat by introducing an element of racism. Overall, this suffers the same fate as many sequels, lacking the originals' freshness and in truth it doesn't give the viewer too many people for whom they can really root. At least it allows Justin Long to reprise his Darry character from the first film, appearing in ghostly form to offer warnings and information to one of the characters here. Nothing especially good, but not bad either; fortunately, one thing it's not is boring. Seven out of 10.

Decent follow-up to Jeepers Creepers takes place just days after the original. The story focuses on a group of athletic high school kids (a varsity team along with their coaches and cheerleaders), who are on their way home when they get stranded in the middle of nowhere after their bus breaks down. They soon come to the terrifying realization that it wasn't an accident, and that they're all being hunted by a meticulous monster who's in the midst of a timely feeding frenzy. At times exciting, with more than enough violence and effective scares make this good fun if you're willing to pardon the annoyingly one-note characters and banal dialogue. **½

JEEPERS CREEPERS II Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSStranded in a broken-down bus on a lonely country road, a group of high school jocks and cheerleaders are targeted by the monstrous Creeper (Jonathan Breck) who needs their body parts for the purposes of regeneration. But the Creeper hasn't reckoned on the tenacity of one of its earlier victims (Ray Wise), a grieving father seeking revenge for the loss of his youngest son...Though crafted with technical precision and performed with gusto by a strong cast of newcomers and veterans, this disappointing sequel sacrifices the heartfelt emotional undertow of its magnificent predecessor JEEPERS CREEPERS (2000) in favor of bigger and splashier set-pieces. While it's as raucous and entertaining as one could hope for, it's also a surprisingly conventional effort from writer-director Victor Salva, whose best work (POWDER, RITES OF PASSAGE, etc.) has always focused on small groups of characters caught up in extreme situations. Here, his attempts to shoehorn deeper issues into what is essentially a popcorn movie seems forced and inconsequential, and he spreads his narrative concerns too thinly over a broad range of interchangeable characters: The elements of homophobia and racism which initially divide the young heroes - until they're forced to overcome their differences in order to survive the Creeper's onslaught - are rendered increasingly meaningless as the movie progresses, until they no longer have any direct influence on the wider storyline.But Salva is too much of a craftsman for his movie to be a complete washout. The action/horror set-pieces are genuinely spectacular, and Breck camps it up superbly as the hideous Creeper, swooping out of the darkness to carry unsuspecting victims to their doom. Working in scope format for the first time in their respective careers (REAL scope, not that Super 35 rubbish), Salva and cinematographer Don E. FauntLeRoy conjure a series of startling images from the outset, many of them tinged with visual poetry: The golden cornfield in the opening sequence, where the film's first victim suffers an appalling fate (a genuinely horrific set-piece); the point-of-view shots from the Creeper's perspective as it swoops on fleeing prey; and the eerie calm of the closing sequence, which portends sequels to come. Salva's regular composer, Bennett Salvay, delivers a terrific symphonic score, as brassy and frightening as any in recent years, which serves to boost the film's dramatic appeal in no uncertain terms.Wise, a late addition to the cast, dominates the film as an avenging farmer who is every bit the Creeper's equal in terms of strength and persistence, and he's given strong support by veterans Diane Delano and Thom Gossom Jr. The younger cast members are enthusiastic and talented, and it's a fair bet that some of them (Travis Schiffner, Al Santos, Nicki Aycox, etc.) will figure heavily in various Hunkiest/Sexiest lists during the next few years. Look out for a brief - but welcome - cameo appearance by Justin Long from "JC1". It may not live up to every expectation, but there's still much to enjoy in JEEPERS CREEPERS II.

Not since the early days of Wes Craven thrillers have we had a really good fright flick to scare us in true Halloween fashion. This one does the trick thanks to some extra good CGI effects and some scary situations in the middle of a deserted countryside where teens find themselves menaced by a winged creature determined to make them his flesh-eating victims.In the only adult role, RAY WISE does a convincing job of making it all look reasonable enough to swallow--and it owes a lot of its punch to the imaginative tales of authors like Stephen King. There are no standout performances among the various teens, but all of them look incredibly afraid of the winged creature--with good reason. The make-up job here is marvelously chilling.The story is the stuff dreams are made of--or rather, nightmares. And it's all done with extremely clever build-up of suspense as the teens, one by one, become divisive and challenge each other in ways that only undermine their vulnerability. A few of the scenes are very graphic in depicting the creature's stranglehold on his victims and not for the squeamish--or the young and impressionable.Recommended as a good fright flick, nothing more. But credit must be given to director Victor Salva for keeping the whole tale tense and taut with visual excitement.Summing up: An above average thriller of its kind. Jonathan Breck makes one scary Creeper.

Back in 2001, audiences were introduced to a creature which we came to understand fed every 23 years for 23 days.  Why?  Well, let's not worry about that.The movie was Jeepers Creepers, and I have to admit that I gave the first installment a mild thumbs up as there were some genuine frights and a villain that was as uniquely interesting as the first time Freddy Krueger reached from under Johnny Depp's bed.  It wasn't a movie that I would tell friends and family to fork over $13 bucks for to see on the big screen, but for a late, rainy Saturday evening, one could do worse.Well, skip ahead two years, and the moderate success of the first installment brought back writer/director, Victor Salva to continue the story of the feeding creature in the crops.  I imagined Victor sitting at his word processor and thinking aloud to himself, `Hmmm.  Ok  The creature feeds every 23 years and it has only been two since the last movie, so we better not dwell too much on that topic. Ok For a sequel we need a bigger body count and sexier stars so lets have a full school bus of ballplayers and cheerleaders stranded and being picked off one by one.  Ok. We need to recognize the first film and show continuity so lets have the main actor from Jeepers Creepers I appear in the sequel.  Oh wait I killed him off.  Ok. Let's have him back in a dream sequence.  Yeah!  That'll work!  Ok. Last thing to worry about is trying to give the creature new characteristics while still making him vulnerable.  I got it!  Let's have him lose his head in one scene and replace it with one of the heads of the school children.  Excellent.  And then let's top off the thrills with having a vengeful father who creates a weapon that will ultimately destroy the creature.  Got it!  Good to go!'I doubt I am going verbatim with what might have been thought or said while trying to shop Jeepers Creepers 2, but I don't think I am straying too far from the truthful facts either. Jeepers Creepers 2 does offer more victims a la every horror sequel and most of the male characters are unbelievable brats that like to get their screen time without their shirts on. They run around uttering such ridiculous dialogue as `We have just dropped a notch on the food chain, man' while showing no signs of protecting he females they lust after so much within their own group. Jeepers Creepers 2 had double the budget as did the first, so it is not surprising that the creature gets more computer generated close-ups or scenes where he flies around picking off his victims at will (Didn't he drive a truck in the first one?).   However, instead of this developing the evil being, it desensitizes us and quite frankly, I was as bored of him as I was of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees after their second kick at the can. 
For horror fans, I still expect that this film was a bit of a disappointment.  The characters were so annoying that you found yourself routing for the creature and as far as beatings go, the creature was stabbed, decapitated, speared, impaled and thrown through a windshield all to no avail.  Where is the tension therefore if a creature is virtually indestructible?  www.gregsrants.com

Jeepers Creepers II (2003) for me is not nearly as good of a story as the first film but it has a few scares and lots of campy humor. This is one of those films where you will find yourself cheering on the monster and not cheer-leading on the side of all those annoying jocks. Instead of hoping there is a way that (most of) the group can survive you will find yourself yelling at the screen "Get all the jocks Creeper!".No this is not a good movie but it is very entertaining and it might get quite a few laughs out of you. Watch this movie for the humor factor and not the horror factor. Jeepers Creepers II (2003) is not a comedy horror but works well with that genre be cause it's more on the funny side and not on the creepy side.I would have rated this movie a 5.5 but it gets a 7 from me for making me laugh.7/10

"Jeepers Creepers 2" is an unnecessary sequel that just rehashes the plot of Part 1 - this time focusing on a group of teenagers who get stranded on a bus. Not much else going on here folks...This reviewer liked the first "Jeepers Creepers" much better. It had better acting, plot, and character development going for it. The sequel is somewhat fun if your a big fan of the original movie- but ultimately lacks everything that made the first film a winner.With nothing new or exciting about "Jeepers Creepers 2", this can be viewed as an O.K. movie at best.

Sequel to the terrific 2001 horror film is a wildly fun ride, even if it doesn't quite live up to the chilling original.On the final evening of his annual feeding, the Creeper terrorizes a bus load of students, while a local farmer is looking for some revenge.While it may lack some of the unique elements of the original film (like the Creeper's truck, the title song, etc.) this sequel is still a highly-energized and occasionally spooky thriller. There's plenty of action, impressive makeup FX, moments of gruesome humor, and tightening suspense to drive it. Once again Salva delivers good directorial touches and an entertaining story.The cast, headed by veteran actor Ray Wise, is good. Especially good are the relatively unknown young stars Nenninger, Aycox, Schiffner, Brown, Hammond, and Delfino. Breck returns as the Creeper and is creepier than ever.While Jeepers Creepers 2 is never as scary as its predecessor it is a very entertaining sequel.*** out of ****

After the smash hit ¨Jeepers Creepers¨ , the Creeper is back for more , every 23rd Spring, for 23 days, it gets to eat , welcome to day 23. As
director Victor Salva made this second part, a decent sequel . Here isn't the surprise that originated the first entry . However , the monster Creeper who can taste your fear appears more time than previous outing , this time attacking a championship basketball team bus . By the time you hear him, by the time you see him it's too late , he is like a bat out of hell. This summer feed your fear , are you hungry for more?
The hapless boys are a teen bunch on a bus, Creeper will attack until to obtain his purpose : a good lunch. Also the feared beast will have to face off an old man (Ray Wise) and his son who will make use a puncher to track down creeper (Jonathan Breck) .In the film there is terror, gore , action, thriller and suspense during all time of lasting film. The final showdown between Creeper and the old man is breathtaking.Creeper's make-up is excellent . Ray Wise interpretation is good, previous starring Justing Long appears briefly, also a cameo. Direction by Victor Salva is nice and acceptable . Rating 6/10 , good sequel.

then this is it. I liked the first film, but all the suspense was left out of this one. The first one started off great with the creepy truck sneaking up on the car. This sequel never even comes close to having any suspense like that.In this, the Creeper targets a school bus on his last night to feed. The creeper is constantly shown in full view, so that removes any suspense there. Plus, he doesn't kill anyone in a gruesome way like in the first. So, most of the film is spent with all these high school kids on the bus and all they do is argue about stupid stuff. One boy with a bad attitude, Scottie, is just rude and blames everyone else and just wants to kick people off the bus. We know what his fate will be. Then the story with Minxie is what is so illogical. For no reason, she becomes this psychic and knows all about the Creeper and how he smells people out to devour. So ridiculous. Then the last part with the final chase and how the Creeper is eventually "killed" was very bad. They even used a bad CGI version of a sky that had too many stars.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth watching, even if you are a huge horror fan.

Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003)I went to see this movie, expecting a bit less than the first movie, but it ended up to be a bit MORE than the first. Jeepers Creepers 2 starts off with a kid in a cornfield, wiring up scarecrows for his father's farm. I won't tell what happens, but it then cuts to a school bus full of basketball players and cheerleaders, who are on their way home from a championship game. Then, they're tire blows out from a sharp metal object thrown by an unseen presence. They decide to try driving for a bit longer, still with 5 running wheels, and then another blows out, again by a sharp metal object thrown at the bus. Then the body count starts. This attempt to create a sequel succeeded, and the very ending of the film, I won't say what it is, was a neat idea. This movie had less gore, but more action and fun than the one before it. I give it an 8/10.

The first "Jeepers Creepers", which was released in 2001, brought much-needed life into an ailing genre of films.  That movie redefined horror and its settings, which instead of the usual ominous darkness, and confined spaces, took place mostly out in the open and in broad daylight.  The movie also introduced us to a truly terrifying creature that could give any other slasher a run for their money.  That movie earned a lot of its merits through tension, genuine shocks, and a general cloud of mystery of the "Creeper" monster.  It didn't try to gross you out with the requisite gore, but the movie worked because so little was explained and a lot was left up to the viewer.    Now we're at 2003's "Jeepers Creepers 2."  The movie works on the level of tension and genuine scares, but sacrifices itself half way through when we learn about how the creature hunts.  (A girl on the bus begins having psychic visions and learns a little about the Creeper from one of the kids who died in the first movie.)  I liked it better when we knew little or nothing about a monster in one of these movies, because that's where the real terror comes from in a horror film.Victor Salva, who wrote and directed both movies knows what he's doing but I just hope that he doesn't screw up his own franchise.  He knows how to scare an audience, but I hope he doesn't give into popular opinion and sacrifice everything he's probably worked so hard for.  7/10

I'm one of those rare people who thinks that this - the sequel to the original 'Jeepers Creepers' is actually better than the first one. The original film was too irritating due to its central characters never really bothered to *properly* escape the 'Creeper' (aka a giant half man/half bat monster with a taste for human bodyparts). However, here we have a central scenario which lends itself better to the situation.A schoolbus full of teenagers gets stranded (with a little help from the Creeper himself) in the middle of nowhere, now the flying bat out of hell can take his pick of their tender, young, tasty bodies for him to consume and regenerate.However, all is not lost for our prepubescent Creeper-fodder, for a local father (played by the typically brooding and sinister Ray Wise, of Twin Peaks and Dead End fame) lost his young son to the Creeper recently and has sworn to track it down and exact some gruesome revenge (with a little help from a pneumatic harpoon).Although most of the action is centred on the (pretty unlikeable) bus-load of teens, there is plenty of gruesome gore and nastiness as the Creeper picks them off one by one.Personally, I would have preferred Ray Wise to be in it more, as he's clearly the best part of the film, but it's still an enjoyable little horror flick nonetheless.

"Jeepers Creepers 2" is a hilarious sequel to the hit comedy "Jeepers Creepers" from 2001. Oh, wait. It's supposed to be horror? Oh, Jesus, we're in trouble then.In that case, this movie sucks. Really badly. The plot is explained by a teenager in distress, people are flat (the best acting comes from the nerdy bill gates wannabe towel boy who practically vomited out his lines, leaving the audience i saw it with in stitches.)The whole audience was laughing at all the right points, making me believe that this was just a send-up, a spoof, of horror movies. Didn't "Scary Movie" fish that lake dry? That's when I discovered it was supposed to be scary.You know the deal. A group of homosexual basketball stars are returning home from a successful championship, when the creeper, this big gooey guy with a vagina on his nose starts eating them all. Pretty soon, its up to farmer joe to harpoon the guy, finally killing him for another 23 years.I don't get it, I don't get the 23 thing. Everything's 23. The 23rd spring of the 23rd year for 23 days, the creeper eats people. Why? Why is he doing this? Just because? Well, in that case, I guess I'll be kidnapping small girls now, BECAUSE I CAN.I wished someone would explain to me how this is scary or exciting. Everything's predictable, so much so that it was funny. 1/10.PS Please note that I do NOT kidnap small children, nor do I condone doing so. You sick freaks.

"Jeepers Creepers 2" trades the familiarity of creeping tension for in the face, well timed action sequences. Where it doesn't work so much as a straight horror thriller this time around, what with nothing new to be discovered about the startling "Creeper", returning director/writer Victor Salva ups the ante on the gore and stylized action, resulting in an enjoyable monster movie that doesn't skimp out on the bloodshed audiences would expect from a horror sequel, especially one that has to live up to such a frightening experience as the first film. "Creepers 2" jumps into the action as quickly as the first film did, and the Creeper is even more of an unsettling creation in this second chapter. He was dusty and ancient looking in the first film, here the makeup artists have had a field day and we can tell the creature has done a lot of feeding. Throw a diverse group of students on a cramped school bus that conveniently breaks down in the middle of nowhere, right in Creeper territory, and you've got a typical sequel that may not score points for originality but proves to be a great vehicle for suspense and graphic, shocking imagery. Salva keeps the plot (except the Creeper himself) at a reasonably believable boiling point, drawing an interweaving story between the group of kids trapped in the bus, their collective psychosis breaking down as the Creeper terrorizes them and picks them off one by one, and a toughened old farmer who's out for vengeance against the demon. Salva wraps it up in a neat package that stops just shy of wearing out its welcome and Bennet Salvay's rich score leavens the scares wonderfully throughout. Not as scary or original as the first, but a worthy and creepy effort nonetheless, with some riveting scares and decent performances from all involved. Where'd you get those peepers? Keep an eye out for the really great horror makeup effects, they stand out and give "Jeepers Creepers 2" some of its nastiest energy.

...watching this film.I was quite enamoured with the original as I felt that it was a breath of fresh air amongst all the usual teeny slashers that have been about for the past few years. There was no guessing who was doing it, you knew who (if not exactly what) was responsible. In a nutshell, I had high hopes for a sequel (obviously something that you should never have!).It was, in my personal opinion, terrible. Not especially creepy, no story line as such and characters that you felt nothing for. A bunch of school kids (how original) and a vengeful father, I was actually glad when they died as you didn't have to watch them anymore.The only spooky bit was in the cornfield at the very beginning, after that it was downhill all the way. Who lives, who dies, who cares?

If a film is successful, then it must be tempting to simply offer a second helping. It is therefore creditable of the Jeepers Creepers crew to go for an ensemble piece of the "Who is going to live and who is going to die?" variety for the Creeper's second outing.Good points - the Creeper himself, the disgusting head replacement sequence, the level of tension maintained throughout, and the ending.The main bad point - and it's a biggie - is that the students stuck in the bus are all so thoroughly obnoxious that I din't care about any of them surviving. I found myself rooting for the Creeper, and hoping that he would polish most of them off.Even so, this is a pretty reasonable sequel.

If you compare this one to the first movie, it wouldn't be fare. The first one was million times better horror movie than this movie is. This is just a franchise to suck up our money.One thing I quite impress is the used of Justin, after all he's dead in the first but how come he is in this second movie. So that the reason I watch this second installment. And he fool me bad, I should have seen it coming. This one there nothing into it just a bunch of kids running and screaming and get angry at each other. Ordinary kids won't sell so they used jocks and cheerleaders to do so. Anyway it not all that bad, the movie is pretty entertaining and you will know what happen what happen to the creepers on exact 23 days come to an end.Recommendation: Yes. But if you big fan of first one don't, it might ruin your imagination.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: C-)

Jeepers Creepers II is much better movie then the first one ever was and i think is the best one of the two! Here we find out more about the Creeper like who he is, what is he want's. Better story then was in first one, high school kids on corn field. Part 2 is the best one of the Creeper. I was also reading about Gina Philips that she declined offers to reprise her role as Trish Jenner in sequel but i'm so glad that Justin Long did return in this movie as Darry Jenner when he warned Minxie Hayes what is going to happened to her and her friends and what has happened to him. Ray Wise did great job as Jack Taggart Sr. getting revenge on Creeper for kidnapping his younger son. Great story, plot, writing and acting i was really surprised with this movie. The best one of the two. I still don't understand why people don't like this movie, criticizing and saying not better then the first one or first one is the best? You don't have a taste in movies. What did you except that is going to be like 1st one a copy of the movie? What's wrong with you? Part 2 beats the first one and you can't say it was the worst one when it was not! You don't understand this movie if you leave complain about it!OK the story set after the first one Creeper: Stranded on a lonely road, a school bus full of high school basketball players, their coaches, and cheerleaders must defend themselves from the Creeper - a flesh-eating ancient beast that resurfaces on the earth every 23 years to feed. Meanwhile, a farmer and his son set out on a personal mission to hunt the Creeper down.Schoolbus tire's got flat on a lonely road full of high school kids who are returning home from there basketball game. Minxie Hayes a cheerleader got a vision from Darry from the first movie that they are stuck on a lonely road because of Creeper and the flat tire wasn't an accident it was a set up. Now this kids are facing with new terror in the night a flesh-eating ancient beast that resurfaces on the earth every 23 years to feed. They are all his food now they have to defend them self's. Meanwhile, a farmer and his son set out on a personal mission to hunt the Creeper down Jack Taggart Sr. and his son Jack Taggart Jr. are out for revenge when Creeper kidnapped and took their own younger son now they wan't revenge and those kids find them self on the way, so they are trying to help them and destroy the Creeper once and for all. At the end of movie they stopped him and capture him. Awesome movie much much better then first one. Btw Trish Jenner was really hot in the first movie. I love this movie i have part I on DVD i wish i could got this movie part II on DVD too. I also hear they are planing to filming part 3 aka.. Jeepers Creepers III : Cathedral (2013) which set's events after their first movie ended and both of character's Trish Jenner and Jack Taggart Sr. come's back in third movie. Just why? Also Trish Jenner is now powerful and rich but why? If they going to do the same plot with the same characters they are going to ruined this sequel movie. Gina Philips turned down the role for her character Trish Jenner why will she come back to get revenge, she didn't wanna come back in part II why now? Gina Philips is a loser so i would rather put some other actress to play her character.Gina Philips didn't make that character: writer,producer and director did! So she should shut the hell up because she's a crappy actress and she's not even famous at all. Nicki Aycox as Minxie Hayes should return back. Nicki Aycox is amazing actress she even played in sequel Joy Ride 2:Dead Ahead that fallowed from the first movie with Paul Walker. I love this movie and i recommend you to watched on DVD or TV is awesome movie beat's first one. I gave 10 out of 10

As a kid, Jeepers Creepers 2 and I have some fond memories. I remember watching it on premium cable and loving it. I bought the DVD and watched it a couple more times after that. I was in love with the film and everything about it. But like all childhood movies, we must fess up and admit it, usually, they're not too great. This one is no exception. The suspense is there, the setting as well, but technical errors and idiotic characters plague this film.The errors in this film are wide, but I picked out a few that I found out without looking at sites that spoil them. If this is supposed to be spring, why is the corn dead? It should be sprouting and just beginning to grow. The Creeper is supposed to only kill a certain type of people, you'll see, but the first three killed on the bus do not fall into this category. Not to mention, why are there only three cheerleaders on the entire bus? Where are the parents? And why is this supposedly long rode called "East 9" vacant? So many question - zero answers. I wasn't even trying to pick out flaws. It was inevitable after twenty minutes I kept noticing more and more.Despite all the flaws, I hate to admit, I liked Jeepers Creepers 2. It brought back vivid memories of late nights when I stayed up to watch this. It picks up four days after the first with a bus full of happy teenagers returning home after winning their basketball championship. When the bus gets a flat, they check the tire and pursue on before blowing another tire which strands them on a road called East 9.Three faculty members are taken abruptly by the winged creature known as "The Creeper" (Breck) who comes out every twenty three years for twenty three days and takes random people to feast on. He needs their external/internal organs the humans provide to function for himself (if he eats an eye, he can see, etc). The leader of the pack when the faculty is dead is the game bench-warmer Scotty (Nenninger). Scotty tries to develop plans to keep the group alive till morning. Since this is the last day of his feast, he scurries to find people to collect.The scares in the film are there. Not full force, but they are present. The whole suspense and uneasy feel is brought back from the original. You're with a group of teenagers, all your same age, stuck on a bus in the middle of nowhere. Cell phone reception is obsolete and no one is answering the CB radio in the bus. It has a certain camp factor, and really utilizes its setting well.I still am completely fond of "The Creeper" character, and would like to see Johnathan Breck come back for the open, yet not filmed, Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral. Something about a winged, cloaked inhumane figure swooping down, grabbing someone by his claws, and flying back up in the air just really entertains me. It's got a very well made creep factor to it. Like an old fifties/sixties horror film.Jeepers Creepers 2 is far from perfect. It doesn't capture every element, and doesn't live up to the first film, but really keeps the tonality of sudden, unsuspecting terror going in the sequel. Director Victor Salva wants to get the ball rolling on the third installment. My advice, keep the scares fierce and the action consistent. We don't have to end the franchise on an abrupt, obscure note.Starring: Johnathan Breck, Ray Wise, Luke Edwards, and Eric Nenninger. Directed by: Victor Salva.

Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003): Dir: Victor Salva / Cast: Ray Wise, Eric Nenninger, Nicki Aycox, Garikayi Mutambirwa, Luke Edwards: Every bit as stupid as the original and it is filled with characters that are about as bright as a pile of cow dung. The creeper apparently feeds every 23 years and in the opening scene it makes off with a boy that thought it was a scarecrow. His father and brother make chase and are surprised when it takes flight. Cut ahead to a bus load of moron football playing teenagers who become stranded when a boney object is found embedded in one of the tires. Before long the adults are snagged leaving the teenagers to bicker while the creeper places them on the lunch menu. They use the bus radio to call for help and it is overheard by the farmer in the film's opening who arms his truck with a harpoon. Stupid and irritable showcasing special effects and mayhem. Directed by Victor Salva who made the very stupid first movie as well as another annoying piece of sh*t called Powder. Ray Wise at least is putting in a reasonable effort as the farmer who is aiming for revenge and justice against the creature who violated his family. Luke Edwards plays the older brother of the first victim who witnesses the attack in the film's opening. The teenagers unfortunately have more air in their heads than a hot air balloon. The bus should be driven over this senseless junk. Score: 2 ½ / 10
