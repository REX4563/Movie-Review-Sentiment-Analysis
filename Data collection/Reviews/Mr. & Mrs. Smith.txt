Since going through most recent action movies is like chewing through cardboard, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is pleasantly energetic for an action flick. Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith is good fun, and does a decent job of satisfying the occasional need for summer-movies.The effectiveness of the film lies in the exploration of what happens to a failing marriage when the couple are at their wits end ... and ... for the first time, come to realize that the other is a professional assassin ... and ... subsequently push the ceiling on what is termed 'spousal abuse' ... and ... of course, get to play with guns.The success of the film, however, lies in how Jolie and Pitt actually bother to exercise some of their acting talent. They look like they are having fun, and genuinely enjoy the other (surprise! surprise!). The chemistry is good, and the actors are super sexy, which is always a plus for any film.The movie fails, naturally, when the ending summarily degenerates into what is expected of action-fare, the shootouts, gun battles, and kisses. Enjoyable, nonetheless, even on its final wonky legs.(Note: it is also a shame that in a film with so much shooting that no one gets to shoot Mr. Vince Vaughn. My, is that guy a terrible actor who can't resist hiding himself.)

It may be unfair to say, but its easily admitted that the most interesting ploy this film can rely on was the media storm surrounding "THE affair" that led to "THE Hollywood couple to be" Brangelina. As a matter of fact, the film is actually rather good and the playful yet genuine chemistry berween Pitt and Jolie excuses the ludicrous plot and reliance on marketing gimmicks. The film really isn't a serious one, but it is a sexy one.

John and Jane Smith have been married for five or six years and there marriage is going through a bit of a rough patch the events that follow will either bring them back together or kill them! Each of them thinks the other has an ordinary job but in fact they each work as assassins for rival organisations; when they get sent after the same target there is bound to be trouble. They end up shooting at each other and the target gets away; believing they could be identified each is given forty eight hours to kill the other. At this point they don't realise who the rival assassin was but when they find out they quickly stop trusting each other and start trying to shoot each other! After shooting up the house they realise that they genuinely love each other; the problem is now both their organisations are using all their resources to eliminate Mr and Mrs Smith!.While this isn't a classic film it is rather fun in a very silly way. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do well in the leading roles even though they have both been better in other films. The story is of course preposterous but if you can suspend your disbelief and but your brain in neutral it is worth watching. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and the action is fairly intense without any gore or real unpleasantness the final shoot out manages to be action packed and hilarious at the same time! Over all I'd say this is definitely worth watching if it is on television or if the DVD is in the bargain bin.

This is a daaaamn fun movie! Heh. To all the critics, yes, there are a lot of explosions, gunfire, unrealistic battles, plenty of times where you think "they MUST have been hit by a bullet by now..there is noo effin way...", and over-dramatized violence, but there's plenty of good stuff too that should not be ignored.Probably the best part about this movie is the couple. I know it's been said before, but it's so true that I'm gonna repeat: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have incredible chemistry. It's no wonder they're still together today. Even when the movie couple, John and Jane Smith, where in their "off period" of marriage, you could feel something between the two. They are an amazing screen couple, they work incredibly well together. Their dialogue is just right...when one says something to the other, it's smooth and real. And of course, Pitt and Jolie are both extremely attractive, so they're fun to watch. Haha.The plot is all right..nothing extraordinary. It's a typical action movie plot, simple enough to leave plenty of room for the battle shots and violence. Nothing special. The dialogue wasn't bad, it wasn't lame action movie words. No stupid puns or anything. There was really nice cinematography, some shots that really were stunning. Usually the emotional aspect of action movies is dense and easy, cliché and boring, but I liked it in this movie. You could tell that they really loved each other, yet at the same time were committed to their jobs. You could feel the conflict.I own this movie and I'm glad I do. It's a good time. I recommend it.

A bored married couple named John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) is shocked to learn that they are both assassins hired by competing agencies to eliminated each other. In the process, they learn more from each other as their affections for each other grow.This is a cleverly devised script in a plot filled with humor (albeit, a little corny at times) and believable acting (for the most part). I don't recall too much moments that bored me to tears, and was entertained by the drama, the chemistry between John and Jane, the suspense and tension between the two competing agencies, and the overall action.Grade B-

My God, is everyone who reviews this movie here brain damaged? This movie's plot crosses the believability line halfway through the feature and never returns. I like action but I hate action that is this blatantly dumb. I thought movies like "Sahara" rewrote the dumb action book but this trash just adds too the new low.SPOILERS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Why on earth did their respective agencies try and secretly set them up to face each other instead of just flat out eliminating them with bullets to the head at their offices? It's a good thing those agencies sent hit men by the dozens who couldn't shoot straight. This whole plot was extraordinarily dumb.

If you look at this film as merely another glitzy Hollywood spy thriller/spoof -- in the grand tradition of say OUR MAN FLINT or KINGSMAN -- then it is merely an "8". As in great writing, acting, direction, casting and generally a lot of fun.So far, so good.Here is the trick -- for viewers of the future, when we mere mortals have come and gone, but the IMDb lives on, this is better viewed as a time capsule.The two stars were, to under-state it -- at the peak of their fame and charisma. I recall from the time a survey which conclusively showed, for example, that Angelina was not merely the hottest woman in show business but possibly (these surveys tend to over-state) the hottest woman on the planet.(To be fair, they only surveyed living men. If the dead had also been allowed to vote, who knows, maybe Helen of Troy would have won?) And the Bradster was also at his peak.Once you understood the hidden and secret dynamic of the film, it becomes both iconic and classic, and will be entertaining viewers for a very very long time.(PS == watch Vince Vaughn before TRUE DETECTIVE, also of historical interest)

What a terrible movie. It reminded me a lot of "America's Sweethearts" because that starred A-list Hollywood actors trying to be funny in completely predictable and ridiculous situations. This movie is exactly the same, it has nothing new to offer. It is very standard formulaic fare, a popcorn movie of the worst sort, which is not even in the least bit amusing. Yes, both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are attractive actors, but that is about it. The rest of the movie is a waste and makes no sense at all.Their agencies send them on a hit to take each other out because they are married to each other?????? Did they not think that perhaps one MIGHT see the other and MIGHT not shoot them because they were MARRIED? Gee, that sounds like a solid plot. Or how about Jolie jumping off the roof while holding her handbag with one arm? I can take incredulous stunts, but not when they make fun of the audience. That was as bad as many of the ridiculous stunts in Charlie's Angels 2. And as many reviewers pointed out, they are apparently the only people their agencies employ who can shoot straight (didn't Schwartzenegger already do that to death in Commando?).And what about the bit when she said her "Temps" did all the cooking? So are we supposed to believe the temps had been living in their basement for 6 years delivering food via the magic elevator oven but Brad Pitt never noticed? What happened to his honed hit-man senses? And she has made 312 hits in the past and he never once wondered where she might be? Presumably if she dresses as a hooker for her MO, she would probably be better off whacking guys at night, but I guess old Brad is a sound sleeper. And why pick 312 anyway? That is an impossibly high number which equates to 1 a week for 6 years. Guess no one else ever figured out someone was offing people..... I know, I know, it was just a summer popcorn movie, but how about a little effort on the script? I mean the Jackal spent months, if not years, setting up his one single hit! I actually laughed out loud when she said 312, having just predicted the entire conversation.And I won't even start about the 97 guys dressed in black they whack, fortunately only Pitt and Jolie were smart enough to wear bulletproof vests whereas the trained assassins, (who had planned the raid), arrived wearing apparently bullet-seeking outfits, have never heard of cover, and whose strategy appears to be running into an endless spray of bullets. The entire movie was fantastically frustrating. There was no attempt to make any sense at all of the plot, even the beginning was ridiculous. The Columbian police were looking for a lone assassin, therefore because Jolie joins Pitt at the bar, it can't be her???? Come on, how about a little effort?!! There was not even any good humour, it was all the one-liner obvious put-down type.Just terrible. It's drivel, tripe, brutal. They made them out to be too cool, too tough, and too perfect, and all they ended up being was moronic, sickening, and smarmy.Sigh.

"Bourne Identity' was a great film because it tried to keep you anchored in the real world. "Swingers" was great because it knew where to draw the line at 'over the top'. This movie tries to have it both ways. How can 'over the top' action scenes be taken seriously? Evidently, we are supposed to take this film's premise very lightly. But yet, there is some hardcore violence and death of a lot of good guys. How can we have any empathy for a loving couple that are being hunted, when they survive thousands of bullets with nary a scratch? M&MS does not know when to draw that line. I am reminded of moments in the series "The Sopranos", which also juxtaposes violence with humour. You can only allow so much humour before you start to lose interest, and you can only take so much violence before you lose your taste for the story.The screenplay shines when it examines secrecy between married couples, and lets the characters work it out for themselves. But the third act of the film disposes a great deal of character development for standard Hollywood Action scenes. The action scenes, while technically well executed, become tedious. I was rooting for this film, because it started off as a fun and smart film. I lost it when it stretched the material and launched into cookie cutter cliché action scenes. "Bourne Identity" had action scenes that represented real peril to the lead characters, but M&MS has action scenes that make it obvious that the lead characters are more like cartoons.By the third act, my enthusiasm waned. I was surprised when I walked out to find the movie was only 2 hours long, because the way the second half of this film dragged made it feel more like 2 and ½ hours. I wouldn't say I felt duped, thinking the gimmick of this film would've been handled in a smarter fashion. It's just that the number implausibilities caught up with me to the point that I had to reject the entire film. Wait for the DVD.

This movie starts powerful, but unfortunately, as the plot develops, the anticipation decreases. At the end the viewer is bored with 'brainless' action, that we have been seeing since the second Rambo movie (the first didn't have so much shooting).The cast is good, Pitt and Jolie give life to their characters, but it takes much more than two good actors to create a good film.The final shooting scene kept me asking, is there a gunfight, or am I watching someone playing Half-Life 2 with god mode on? This movie lacks balance. The bad guys look pathetic, they look as if they haven't held a gun before, much less used it. It's just the late Hollywood tendency, not to care about plausibility, but just brainless action, and the more, the better.Bottom line : Mr. and Mrs. Smith is an entertaining movie. It has several ingenious moments, a good idea, great effects, nice camera-work, but come on, the bad guys are supposed to be pros :) . But don't expect to see something like "Face/Off", simply because you won't.

No relation to the 1940's Alfred Hitchcock comedy of the same name, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is an actioner/comedy/thriller that manages to entertain in spite of some serious limitations.John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) are not your typical married couple. (Yeah, I know, we've heard stories like this before, but this film's hardly original). They both live a seemingly normal life together, in a nice house in a nice neighbourhood. Both are trained assassins, but they don't even know the truth about one another. That is, until they are dispatched to kill the same target.Shades of Alias, The Incredibles and True Lies consistently surface, from the deceptions to the violence to the thrills. What differentiates Mr. & Mrs. Smith from those other works is its sense of fun.Director Doug Liman showed with The Bourne Identity that he is adept with action, and films such as Go have shown his skill with plotting and character. Unfortunately the film's plot is all over the place, even when the film is at its most entertaining, and the character moments are rather ordinary.It is saved mostly due to the sparring between the two leads. When Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are on screen together, competing with one another either verbally or physically, this film really soars. (Jolie has more than just atoned for her performance in Alexander here; for the first time in a long while, I found her tolerable.) This, in addition to some inventive set design and cool gadgets, is what effectively constitutes half, it not more, of the film. At one point I was convinced that this would be my first truly unqualified recommendation of the summer.Alas, not long after John and Jane find each other out, the fun, laughs and excitement give way to a succession of eventually tedious chases and shoot-outs. After being very entertaining for long periods, the film begins to outstay its welcome very quickly. There are still some enjoyably quirky moments hidden in there, but I doubt that most viewers will still be as attentive by this point.I would have appreciated Mr. & Mrs. Smith more if it had maintained the tone that came before the generic action scenes throughout the entire film. Then again, that probably wouldn't have filled up the two hour running length, would it? Mr. & Mrs. Smith is entertaining enough, I suppose, but in my opinion it's a wasted opportunity. And that's not the first of those I've come across this season.Rating: 6/10

Movies, like books, can't be judged by the packaging. When it came out in '05, the reviews were above average, but didn't appear to ring everybody's chimes so I avoided seeing it.Buying the DVD seemed like a safe bet when it came out. It had lots of action and two marquee stars. But having been burned buying movies I hadn't seen - Sideways, Lost In Translation (O.K., not burned but a bit disappointed) - I passed. I'd wait till it dropped below $10.Time passed and now it's on T.V. I happened to be flipping channels when I stumbled on its opening scene at the marriage councilor. Right away I was hooked. It had the marriage milieu nailed in a few minutes, like Orson Welles in Citizen Kane: the awkward questions and answers, the poorly disguised discomfort, the seething resentment.It got even better with the banality of home life: the glaring silences, the perfunctory politeness, the stilted discourse, the hidden frustration, ennui, equivocation, avoidance, and interior decorating conflicts. Maybe you actually have to be married to appreciate how true the representation was.Then the plot twists that accentuated the facade. More twists. Don't let your guard down for an instant, or you may get killed! The subtle, pleading moments. Like when Jane hangs up on him in the car. Additional twists and action all the way into a grand finale with scads of bullets, bombs, etc.Is the true love of shared experience beyond the banality of everyday life realized? Well, you have to see the movie.Yes, the plot is complicated, and sometimes doesn't make sense, like marriage, but on closer inspection reveals hidden reservoirs of true feeling and connection.I guess I had overlooked a great film, just like John and Jane had overlooked each other.

The film was a big disappointment. The actors and actresses did their jobs well - and they certainly are 'beautiful people' for the screen. But the screenplay was weak. The dialog was limited. The two main characters didn't have much to say to each other except "I'd rather be nowhere else, but right here with you." The film relied on the action/comedy formula of explosions, guns, and fast cars, with an occasional nifty quip, like "Those extra side doors (on a mini-van) really are handy."The screenplay does a poor job explaining the situations in which we find the characters. Why would two lovers try to kill each other? Any sane person would have tried to talk over the issues - but no - they try to kill each other and destroy their house while they are at it. This scene was excessive and went on for what seemed to be a protracted amount of time. Then they fall back in love and proceed to wipe out 52 black clad ninja assassins armed only with MP5 sub-machine guns and bullet-proof Kevlar vests. This was the other excessive and gratuitous scene that went on for a long time. There was also a car chase scene that was good - if you haven't already seen a movie with a car chase scene in it.There were a few comedic moments and the movie was two hours of entertainment - which is why I gave it three stars.But the screenplay has so many holes it leaks like a sieve. We are left with too many unanswered questions, e.g., what did Vince Vaughn's character decide to do at the end? Not kill his friend? Hire killers? Who do the Smiths work for? Why can't their agencies have them married and working together?On the plus side - Angelina fans almost get to see a nip - and there are plenty of gratuitous bust and leg shots. The S&M queen scene is 'bound' to please fans also. I'm glad the kids weren't with us. For excessive violence and adult situations the film should have been rated 'R'.

Amazing directing amazing cast amazing storyIt is definitely the besttttttLoved it!

I'm only adding this review to help stop the overall score from being dragged down by so many people awarding 1 star.This film was never supposed to have a mind bending plot or a message that plays on the audience's minds for months after watching. It is intended as a bit of light relief with zero effort required to watch. I had seen it some years ago but had mostly forgotten the plot, which could be written on a post-it note and still leave room for a small shopping list.And fun it is! The main characters are beautiful and funny with a good deal of chemistry. The script is lightweight and light-hearted, but always entertaining. Everything else is ready-mix Hollywood & ticks all the required boxes.The violence & shooting is so excessive, it becomes part of the humour. It's not graphic or scary compared to most serious action filmsAfter watching the Hannibal series back to back for the last few days, this was a perfect choice!

Cheesy story, boring as-if action that's been done a million times, what else can I say, just lame Hollywood garbage at its finest. I'm glad I got to see this for free, because it was really a waste of time. There is only one good part, and that is when Mr. Smith hits a guy in the head with a golf club. Other than than the movie does not offer anything more than a few shots of Lip Lady (Jolie) in fish nets for all the guys who think she is hot (c'mon, she really is just plain freakish with all that plastic surgery) and some shots of Brad Pitt with his shirt off for all the 14 year old girls who will probably go see this movie for that reason alone. This movie would have been better if they would have actually killed each other, and thus, brought the film to an end after about 40 minutes. I gave Mr. & Mrs. Smith a 4/10 because at least it was produced well and had some decent stunts and special fx, but other than that, I would say it is almost as bad the The Matrix 2 and 3.

Since going through most recent action movies is like chewing through cardboard, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is pleasantly energetic for an action flick. Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith is good fun, and does a decent job of satisfying the occasional need for summer-movies.The effectiveness of the film lies in the exploration of what happens to a failing marriage when the couple are at their wits end ... and ... for the first time, come to realize that the other is a professional assassin ... and ... subsequently push the ceiling on what is termed 'spousal abuse' ... and ... of course, get to play with guns.The success of the film, however, lies in how Jolie and Pitt actually bother to exercise some of their acting talent. They look like they are having fun, and genuinely enjoy the other (surprise! surprise!). The chemistry is good, and the actors are super sexy, which is always a plus for any film.The movie fails, naturally, when the ending summarily degenerates into what is expected of action-fare, the shootouts, gun battles, and kisses. Enjoyable, nonetheless, even on its final wonky legs.(Note: it is also a shame that in a film with so much shooting that no one gets to shoot Mr. Vince Vaughn. My, is that guy a terrible actor who can't resist hiding himself.)

I find it quite hard to..i don't know..analyse this movie.On one hand this could be a masterpiece, with the swirling clever cinematography and the obvious chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (as they hitched up in real life during the filming). But, on the other hand, this is a stupid film, just an action flick, trying to be emotional and meaningful but turned out trying to be a blockbuster.I hope you see what i mean. I have rated this film 7, because of the reasons above, as the clever cinematography mixed with some good fun comedy and watchable action can't be that harmless can it. Can it? See for yourself.

John Smith and Jane Smith has the perfect marriage. Well, not quite so perfect. And they've been keeping secrets from each other. They work for rival firms that do outsourcing work for the CIA. (Sadly, this would be better if viewers didn't know this for the first twenty minutes of the film, but the previews already gave it away.) Based on the preview, I thought this would be a Pitt-Jolie lovefest. I have enjoyed many of Pitt's films but not so many of Jolie's. And together, it was like a showcase of perfection for the American masses. Do I need to be reminded I'll never be handsome or rich? (Some will say movies help us escape this, and maybe it does, but still...) My concerns were unfounded. This movie is well-acted, well-directed and well-written. The story is layered and brilliant, as well as quite funny. The direction fits well. The acting is superb, some of the best from Brad Pitt yet. And the explosions and gunfire and things breaking and high-tech gadgets? Very nice - someone put a lot into this film and/or has some natural talent I hope we see more of in Hollywood.I don't know if this film is PG-13 or R. I heard it was PG-13 because a sex scene was cut. Well, let me say: you should have kept the scene and kept the R. With all the excessive violence (really over the top) and the cussing, a little smut isn't going to make much difference. I mean, as an action film, I expect a solid R rating (look at Bruce Willis and "Die Hard" or "Hostage").No real complaints about this movie. I really want to say something bad, but I cannot. I was entertained the whole time and found the film very persuasively believable. I don't know who wrote or directed this (I guess I could check, but I didn't) but they just scored points in my book. Unless it was Michael Bay, but I'm pretty sure he had nothing to do with this.

It may be unfair to say, but its easily admitted that the most interesting ploy this film can rely on was the media storm surrounding "THE affair" that led to "THE Hollywood couple to be" Brangelina. As a matter of fact, the film is actually rather good and the playful yet genuine chemistry berween Pitt and Jolie excuses the ludicrous plot and reliance on marketing gimmicks. The film really isn't a serious one, but it is a sexy one.

I saw an advance screening of this movie tonight, and I must say it far exceeded my expectations! Of course, due to the stars involved I knew there'd be sex appeal. And due to the advertising I knew there'd be plenty of stuff "gettin' blowed up real good." But what I wasn't expecting was the tongue in cheek jokes, dark humor, and respectable plot twist! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will only fuel rumors of their relationship with their performances - their chemistry on screen is scintillating, to say the least. The allure of each actor as an individual is undeniable, but when they're together, whether getting busy or getting pummeled, the screen fairly sizzles. It's a popcorn, Hollywood movie, of course, and you'll have to get past the fact that the two leads are the only two among many professional killers who seem to be decent shots! But the action is kickin, the acting well above par, the leads luminous, the plot is lots of fun, and the laughs are plenty. Enjoy! I sure did...

Back when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were getting more attention than any couple since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton it seemed serendipitous that Mr.&Mrs. Smith arrived as a film vehicle to take advantage of all that publicity. It certainly features the sex appeal of both. With a lot of violence thrown in as well. In fact the violence is positively erotic at times.Pitt and Jolie are a pair of hit people who work for different arms of the federal government and if you can believe it have no idea what the other does. They get assigned from their agencies to the same case, but one to protect, the other to destroy a target played by Adam Brody. After that they learn of each other and try to kill each other.Even before Jolie was raiding tombs as Lara Croft she certainly had the fighting skills and spirit. Looking at the two of them I really got the impression they were having some great fun together. That fact really permeates your experience watching Mr.&Mrs. Smith.Just beware lest you think that this is remake of the Alfred Hitchcock film Mr.&Mrs. Smith. That it's not, but these Smiths are enjoyable enough as is.

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play husband and wife "John and Jane Smith", a seemingly ordinary couple living in the suburbs, who each have a secret that they keep from each other: they're assassins for competing organizations. Their marriage is put to the test when they're assigned to kill each other, adding even more excitement to their romance.Mr. and Mrs. Smith isn't the best film of the summer but if you're looking for some mindless fun then this movie should fit the bill. It offers enough explosions and romance to engage the viewer and the film hardly ever gets boring. The script is the only thing that keeps the movie back from truly succeeding. It is riddled with holes and some large ones as well. Of course, they didn't even occur to me until the movie had finished. This shows that the film is quite engaging if it can take your mind off the problems with the story. The screenplay was written by Simon Kinberg and he was behind Elektra and XXX 2. So, it's no surprise the script is weak since he probably only focuses on the action sequences and not the actual plot and character development.The acting is pretty good and the actors make up for the weak script. Angelina Jolie offers a very good performances and she looks amazing on screen. Her co-star also gives a good and funny performance. Together, Pitt and Jolie have more than enough chemistry to carry the movie and the film works so well because of them. Vince Vaughn is the highlight of the supporting cast and his performance is pretty funny. His role may not be very big but every time he appears on screen, he manages to keep the audience laughing. Adam Brody gives a terrible performance and he isn't funny at all. Luckily, his role is small so he doesn't hurt the film too much.Doug Liman does a decent job behind the camera but I was expecting a little more since he also directed The Bourne Identity. He does a nice job with the action sequences and the film has a very nice style to it. However, the movie still felt a little ordinary and I don't think he really took full advantage of this interesting premise. If you do give the film a shot, keep in mind that this is a summer blockbuster and not an Oscar quality movie. It entertains the eyes and it won't make you think. In the end, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is worth checking out in theaters. Rating 7.3/10

John and Jane Smith have been married for five or six years and there marriage is going through a bit of a rough patch the events that follow will either bring them back together or kill them! Each of them thinks the other has an ordinary job but in fact they each work as assassins for rival organisations; when they get sent after the same target there is bound to be trouble. They end up shooting at each other and the target gets away; believing they could be identified each is given forty eight hours to kill the other. At this point they don't realise who the rival assassin was but when they find out they quickly stop trusting each other and start trying to shoot each other! After shooting up the house they realise that they genuinely love each other; the problem is now both their organisations are using all their resources to eliminate Mr and Mrs Smith!.While this isn't a classic film it is rather fun in a very silly way. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do well in the leading roles even though they have both been better in other films. The story is of course preposterous but if you can suspend your disbelief and but your brain in neutral it is worth watching. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and the action is fairly intense without any gore or real unpleasantness the final shoot out manages to be action packed and hilarious at the same time! Over all I'd say this is definitely worth watching if it is on television or if the DVD is in the bargain bin.

This is a daaaamn fun movie! Heh. To all the critics, yes, there are a lot of explosions, gunfire, unrealistic battles, plenty of times where you think "they MUST have been hit by a bullet by now..there is noo effin way...", and over-dramatized violence, but there's plenty of good stuff too that should not be ignored.Probably the best part about this movie is the couple. I know it's been said before, but it's so true that I'm gonna repeat: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have incredible chemistry. It's no wonder they're still together today. Even when the movie couple, John and Jane Smith, where in their "off period" of marriage, you could feel something between the two. They are an amazing screen couple, they work incredibly well together. Their dialogue is just right...when one says something to the other, it's smooth and real. And of course, Pitt and Jolie are both extremely attractive, so they're fun to watch. Haha.The plot is all right..nothing extraordinary. It's a typical action movie plot, simple enough to leave plenty of room for the battle shots and violence. Nothing special. The dialogue wasn't bad, it wasn't lame action movie words. No stupid puns or anything. There was really nice cinematography, some shots that really were stunning. Usually the emotional aspect of action movies is dense and easy, cliché and boring, but I liked it in this movie. You could tell that they really loved each other, yet at the same time were committed to their jobs. You could feel the conflict.I own this movie and I'm glad I do. It's a good time. I recommend it.

I recall from the time a survey which conclusively showed, for example, that Angelina was not merely the hottest woman in show business but possibly (these surveys tend to over-state) the hottest woman on the planet.(To be fair, they only surveyed living men. If the dead had also been allowed to vote, who knows, maybe Helen of Troy would have won?) And the Bradster was also at his peak.Once you understood the hidden and secret dynamic of the film, it becomes both iconic and classic, and will be entertaining viewers for a very very long time.(PS == watch Vince Vaughn before TRUE DETECTIVE, also of historical interest)

I have only watched the theatrical cut of this one, but I thought it was nice. I hoped for more (although it is well rounded, beginning - end connection, of course I'm talking about the psychiatrist), but what I saw was satisfying enough. I mean what can you do with a crazy premise like that? Two hit-mans in love with each other, but both don't know what profession the other one is doing ... no wait that was the plot outline for "Assasins" with Antonio Banderas and Sylvester Stallone ... ;o) Just kidding, of course its the plot line for this movie. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are even married (in the movie), how did they know what their life partner is doing? And how would it be possible, that they had to kill each other? But it works fine, especially with a great supporting part from Vince Vaughn. Now I just have to watch the re-cut, which is supposedly even better!

What a terrible movie. It reminded me a lot of "America's Sweethearts" because that starred A-list Hollywood actors trying to be funny in completely predictable and ridiculous situations. This movie is exactly the same, it has nothing new to offer. It is very standard formulaic fare, a popcorn movie of the worst sort, which is not even in the least bit amusing. Yes, both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are attractive actors, but that is about it. The rest of the movie is a waste and makes no sense at all.Their agencies send them on a hit to take each other out because they are married to each other?????? Did they not think that perhaps one MIGHT see the other and MIGHT not shoot them because they were MARRIED? Gee, that sounds like a solid plot. Or how about Jolie jumping off the roof while holding her handbag with one arm? I can take incredulous stunts, but not when they make fun of the audience. That was as bad as many of the ridiculous stunts in Charlie's Angels 2. And as many reviewers pointed out, they are apparently the only people their agencies employ who can shoot straight (didn't Schwartzenegger already do that to death in Commando?).And what about the bit when she said her "Temps" did all the cooking? So are we supposed to believe the temps had been living in their basement for 6 years delivering food via the magic elevator oven but Brad Pitt never noticed? What happened to his honed hit-man senses? And she has made 312 hits in the past and he never once wondered where she might be? Presumably if she dresses as a hooker for her MO, she would probably be better off whacking guys at night, but I guess old Brad is a sound sleeper. And why pick 312 anyway? That is an impossibly high number which equates to 1 a week for 6 years. Guess no one else ever figured out someone was offing people..... I know, I know, it was just a summer popcorn movie, but how about a little effort on the script? I mean the Jackal spent months, if not years, setting up his one single hit! I actually laughed out loud when she said 312, having just predicted the entire conversation.And I won't even start about the 97 guys dressed in black they whack, fortunately only Pitt and Jolie were smart enough to wear bulletproof vests whereas the trained assassins, (who had planned the raid), arrived wearing apparently bullet-seeking outfits, have never heard of cover, and whose strategy appears to be running into an endless spray of bullets. The entire movie was fantastically frustrating. There was no attempt to make any sense at all of the plot, even the beginning was ridiculous. The Columbian police were looking for a lone assassin, therefore because Jolie joins Pitt at the bar, it can't be her???? Come on, how about a little effort?!! There was not even any good humour, it was all the one-liner obvious put-down type.Just terrible. It's drivel, tripe, brutal. They made them out to be too cool, too tough, and too perfect, and all they ended up being was moronic, sickening, and smarmy.Sigh.

Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a story of a husband and wife who are working as assassins, unbeknownst to each other, and not surprisingly, are in therapy to save their marriage. Ironically, they both believe their lives together are too boring.John Smith (Brad Pitt) meets Jane (Angelina Jolie) while both are in danger of being exposed in a foreign country, while working. They are both experienced assassins at the time and go with the flow, and eventually falling for each other. Neither tells the other what they actually do for a living.Needless to say, they find each other out and both agencies who they work for, give the order to kill the other within 48 hours. Thus, the hijinx ensue. Both are vying for control and to discover how much the other actually knows. Upon finding that they both know everything, a full on mini-war begins.This movie has a little bit of everything. The Smiths are not without their humorous sides, especially Brad Pitt. Also, there are a few good fight scenes, between The Smiths along with some others. There are a few nice weapons to be admired here, as well as some very nice eye candy (I am talking about Miss Jolie, but I hear the ladies are fond of Brad, also). Also, I would like to give an honorable mention to Vince Vaughn as Eddie. I feel his performance was funny, but too small for this movie.This movie is a fun little romp through the house with some nice action scenes. Recommended if you would like a somewhat toned down True Lies. 8/10

"Bourne Identity' was a great film because it tried to keep you anchored in the real world. "Swingers" was great because it knew where to draw the line at 'over the top'. This movie tries to have it both ways. How can 'over the top' action scenes be taken seriously? Evidently, we are supposed to take this film's premise very lightly. But yet, there is some hardcore violence and death of a lot of good guys. How can we have any empathy for a loving couple that are being hunted, when they survive thousands of bullets with nary a scratch? M&MS does not know when to draw that line. I am reminded of moments in the series "The Sopranos", which also juxtaposes violence with humour. You can only allow so much humour before you start to lose interest, and you can only take so much violence before you lose your taste for the story.The screenplay shines when it examines secrecy between married couples, and lets the characters work it out for themselves. But the third act of the film disposes a great deal of character development for standard Hollywood Action scenes. The action scenes, while technically well executed, become tedious. I was rooting for this film, because it started off as a fun and smart film. I lost it when it stretched the material and launched into cookie cutter cliché action scenes. "Bourne Identity" had action scenes that represented real peril to the lead characters, but M&MS has action scenes that make it obvious that the lead characters are more like cartoons.By the third act, my enthusiasm waned. I was surprised when I walked out to find the movie was only 2 hours long, because the way the second half of this film dragged made it feel more like 2 and ½ hours. I wouldn't say I felt duped, thinking the gimmick of this film would've been handled in a smarter fashion. It's just that the number implausibilities caught up with me to the point that I had to reject the entire film. Wait for the DVD.

A wife (Angelina Jolie) and husband (Brad Pitt), both with secret identities as hit-men, are given contracts to kill each other. This movie has some genuine laughs, but just does not work. It is incredibly implausible and silly. While this is not normally a problem (I thrive on silly movies) the movie ultimately fails when it tries to up the drama factor. How can this be taken seriously? Two people, one named Jane Doe, the other John Smith, marry each other spontaneously while not being the least bit suspicious of each other's backgrounds? Even if I wasn't a trained assassin, I would be suspicious. Stu-pid. And it takes them 5-6 years to figure this out? Stu-pider. The acting is fine. Brad plays Brad (and he's done it well over the years) Angelina plays herself. There are a few funny moments supplied mostly by Vince Vaughn, and when Brad and Angeline are trying to conceal their secret identities and later when they try to kill each other (spousal abuse is funny!), but eventually it reclines back into every unmemorable action movie you've ever seen. The bullets become ignorable because there's no way the stars'll die (Even the Terminator was more destructible). You know how the plot ends. Bor-ing. This gets a C

This movie starts powerful, but unfortunately, as the plot develops, the anticipation decreases. At the end the viewer is bored with 'brainless' action, that we have been seeing since the second Rambo movie (the first didn't have so much shooting).The cast is good, Pitt and Jolie give life to their characters, but it takes much more than two good actors to create a good film.The final shooting scene kept me asking, is there a gunfight, or am I watching someone playing Half-Life 2 with god mode on? This movie lacks balance. The bad guys look pathetic, they look as if they haven't held a gun before, much less used it. It's just the late Hollywood tendency, not to care about plausibility, but just brainless action, and the more, the better.Bottom line : Mr. and Mrs. Smith is an entertaining movie. It has several ingenious moments, a good idea, great effects, nice camera-work, but come on, the bad guys are supposed to be pros :) . But don't expect to see something like "Face/Off", simply because you won't.

No relation to the 1940's Alfred Hitchcock comedy of the same name, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is an actioner/comedy/thriller that manages to entertain in spite of some serious limitations.John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) are not your typical married couple. (Yeah, I know, we've heard stories like this before, but this film's hardly original). They both live a seemingly normal life together, in a nice house in a nice neighbourhood. Both are trained assassins, but they don't even know the truth about one another. That is, until they are dispatched to kill the same target.Shades of Alias, The Incredibles and True Lies consistently surface, from the deceptions to the violence to the thrills. What differentiates Mr. & Mrs. Smith from those other works is its sense of fun.Director Doug Liman showed with The Bourne Identity that he is adept with action, and films such as Go have shown his skill with plotting and character. Unfortunately the film's plot is all over the place, even when the film is at its most entertaining, and the character moments are rather ordinary.It is saved mostly due to the sparring between the two leads. When Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are on screen together, competing with one another either verbally or physically, this film really soars. (Jolie has more than just atoned for her performance in Alexander here; for the first time in a long while, I found her tolerable.) This, in addition to some inventive set design and cool gadgets, is what effectively constitutes half, it not more, of the film. At one point I was convinced that this would be my first truly unqualified recommendation of the summer.Alas, not long after John and Jane find each other out, the fun, laughs and excitement give way to a succession of eventually tedious chases and shoot-outs. After being very entertaining for long periods, the film begins to outstay its welcome very quickly. There are still some enjoyably quirky moments hidden in there, but I doubt that most viewers will still be as attentive by this point.I would have appreciated Mr. & Mrs. Smith more if it had maintained the tone that came before the generic action scenes throughout the entire film. Then again, that probably wouldn't have filled up the two hour running length, would it? Mr. & Mrs. Smith is entertaining enough, I suppose, but in my opinion it's a wasted opportunity. And that's not the first of those I've come across this season.Rating: 6/10

Movies, like books, can't be judged by the packaging. When it came out in '05, the reviews were above average, but didn't appear to ring everybody's chimes so I avoided seeing it.Buying the DVD seemed like a safe bet when it came out. It had lots of action and two marquee stars. But having been burned buying movies I hadn't seen - Sideways, Lost In Translation (O.K., not burned but a bit disappointed) - I passed. I'd wait till it dropped below $10.Time passed and now it's on T.V. I happened to be flipping channels when I stumbled on its opening scene at the marriage councilor. Right away I was hooked. It had the marriage milieu nailed in a few minutes, like Orson Welles in Citizen Kane: the awkward questions and answers, the poorly disguised discomfort, the seething resentment.It got even better with the banality of home life: the glaring silences, the perfunctory politeness, the stilted discourse, the hidden frustration, ennui, equivocation, avoidance, and interior decorating conflicts. Maybe you actually have to be married to appreciate how true the representation was.Then the plot twists that accentuated the facade. More twists. Don't let your guard down for an instant, or you may get killed! The subtle, pleading moments. Like when Jane hangs up on him in the car. Additional twists and action all the way into a grand finale with scads of bullets, bombs, etc.Is the true love of shared experience beyond the banality of everyday life realized? Well, you have to see the movie.Yes, the plot is complicated, and sometimes doesn't make sense, like marriage, but on closer inspection reveals hidden reservoirs of true feeling and connection.I guess I had overlooked a great film, just like John and Jane had overlooked each other.

In addition to being the film which turned out to be the genesis for the greatest media circus since OJ, MR. & MRS. SMITH is one of the most richly entertaining, though highly improbable, action adventure yarns to come down the pike in quite a while and was responsible for creating a media firestorm which has come to be known as "Brangelina." Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as John and Jane Smith, married assassins who have somehow been able to keep their occupations from each other for five (or six) years of marriage because they work for different organizations. Things heat up when they are both assigned to the same case in an effort by their respective agencies to take each other out and that's where the fun begins. If you don't think about it at all and just let the story flow over you, fun can be had here. The film boasts energetic direction, a surprisingly deft screenplay, a superb musical score, enough technical gadgetry to make James Bond proud and yes, the on screen chemistry between the leads is positively kinetic...it just about burns a hole in the screen. Brangelina make a white hot team and if you keep an open mind, this a richly entertaining fantasy-action-adventure that is an entertaining roller coaster ride right to the end credits.

The film was a big disappointment. The actors and actresses did their jobs well - and they certainly are 'beautiful people' for the screen. But the screenplay was weak. The dialog was limited. The two main characters didn't have much to say to each other except "I'd rather be nowhere else, but right here with you." The film relied on the action/comedy formula of explosions, guns, and fast cars, with an occasional nifty quip, like "Those extra side doors (on a mini-van) really are handy."The screenplay does a poor job explaining the situations in which we find the characters. Why would two lovers try to kill each other? Any sane person would have tried to talk over the issues - but no - they try to kill each other and destroy their house while they are at it. This scene was excessive and went on for what seemed to be a protracted amount of time. Then they fall back in love and proceed to wipe out 52 black clad ninja assassins armed only with MP5 sub-machine guns and bullet-proof Kevlar vests. This was the other excessive and gratuitous scene that went on for a long time. There was also a car chase scene that was good - if you haven't already seen a movie with a car chase scene in it.There were a few comedic moments and the movie was two hours of entertainment - which is why I gave it three stars.But the screenplay has so many holes it leaks like a sieve. We are left with too many unanswered questions, e.g., what did Vince Vaughn's character decide to do at the end? Not kill his friend? Hire killers? Who do the Smiths work for? Why can't their agencies have them married and working together?On the plus side - Angelina fans almost get to see a nip - and there are plenty of gratuitous bust and leg shots. The S&M queen scene is 'bound' to please fans also. I'm glad the kids weren't with us. For excessive violence and adult situations the film should have been rated 'R'.

Amazing directing amazing cast amazing storyIt is definitely the besttttttLoved it!

I would have watched this movie a couple of dozen times but still the movie is intriguing. Angelina Jolie is fantastic in showing her emotions. Anger and love together wow.

Cheesy story, boring as-if action that's been done a million times, what else can I say, just lame Hollywood garbage at its finest. I'm glad I got to see this for free, because it was really a waste of time. There is only one good part, and that is when Mr. Smith hits a guy in the head with a golf club. Other than than the movie does not offer anything more than a few shots of Lip Lady (Jolie) in fish nets for all the guys who think she is hot (c'mon, she really is just plain freakish with all that plastic surgery) and some shots of Brad Pitt with his shirt off for all the 14 year old girls who will probably go see this movie for that reason alone. This movie would have been better if they would have actually killed each other, and thus, brought the film to an end after about 40 minutes. I gave Mr. & Mrs. Smith a 4/10 because at least it was produced well and had some decent stunts and special fx, but other than that, I would say it is almost as bad the The Matrix 2 and 3.
