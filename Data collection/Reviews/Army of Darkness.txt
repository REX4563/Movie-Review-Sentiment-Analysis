Picking up where "Evil Dead II" left off in a somewhat altered opening, Bruce Campbell, now a full blown Han Solo smart ass, is trapped in the dark ages and is eventually found to be the one fated to the Deadites after he retrieves the Book of the Dead, which can also help send him back to his own time. But Bruce, being as stupid as he is, screws up the magic words that are meant to keep the Army of Darkness away and he ends up unleashing an army of undead skeletons by accident who are led by his evil alter ego. Now he must use his 20th century know how to save the day or else evil will forever rule the Earth. Bruce is back and funnier than ever. No real horror here, more of a parody of a big budget fantasy adventure film. Sadly, a number of great gags were left on the cutting room floor that are generally only seen on extended DVD's and TV showings. Hail to the King, baby.

I remember when this film just came out in the theater, I didn't know anything about the Evil Dead films and in fact hadn't even heard of them. From the previews I had ZERO desire to see this film.  The years went by and in late 2000 or maybe 2001 I finally decided to watch it, cause I'd heard so much about it and just couldn't take it anymore, I had to see what the fuss was about.  I was NOT disappointed!  This is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!!!This movie is definitely not for everyone though.  The comedy in this film is VERY odd, so I could understand if someone didn't find it funny at first. First thing you need to keep in mind is that this movie IS NOT trying to be serious, and most definitely doesn't take itself seriously.  The movie is just plain weird, but that's what makes it so great.  You really can't explain this movie to someone that hasn't seen it, you just need to see it for yourself.Also, if you didn't already know this, this is the 3rd installment to a series.  Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are the first two installments, then Army Of Darkness.  You don't even need to see the first two to understand what's going on or anything like that.  In fact, to this day I still haven't seen Evil Dead.  When I watched Army of Darkness, I hadn't seen either Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2.  Since then, I have seen Evil Dead 2, but neither film is a prerequisite for this film.Also this film has an enormous amount of quotable lines.  Bruce Campbell is THE MAN!  The way he says stuff is just great!Well, I truly hope that you'll watch this movie.  But watch it with an open mind and remember that this IS a STUPID movie, but it's supposed to be. Thanks for reading,-Chris

It's not good as "Evil Dead 2" but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good.7.9/10

Most people would say you can check your brain at the door before you watch this film, but I beg to differ.  This is genuinely intelligent stuff here folks.  The director, Sam Raimi, reminds us in this film what it is like to have fun.  From the film itself, as well as the DVD featurettes, it is apparent that Mr. Raimi is having a blast doing what he does best.  It shows too.  Granted, there is not much in the line of plot or theme, but these would be totally gratuitous in this escapist piece.  Instead, we are given a fantastic adventure, appropriately tongue-in-cheek special effects, and an ode to The Three Stooges.  The facial expressions of Bruce Campbell alone make this film well worth its 80 minutes.  I don't want to give away a single joke, because the experience is just too much fun.  So, do yourself a favor.  Watch this film without being so hard on yourself.  Yes, you are allowed to laugh.  There can be non-sardonic humor in modern day America. Sam Raimi proves it.

Okay, maybe it's more comedy than horror, but who cares? Army of Darkness is an awesome movie. Bruce Campbell does an excellent job as Ash, the arrogant and hilarious hero armed with his trusty chainsaw and 'boom stick'. The plot was great and fresh, showing that the people behind the scenes were not trying to do the same thing that made Evil Dead I & II popular. The movie is filled with sword swinging skeletons, kick boxing witches and slap stick. Bruce Campbell has some excellent one liners. To sum it up, Army of Darkness is groovy.But you can let it end here. Give us another sequel please.

Army of Darkness (1992) is in my opinion by far the best one of the "Evil Dead" trilogy! It is my second favorite film of the trilogy, I just love, love this movie to death!!!! It is my personal favorite horror movie in the Evil Dead series. The best one is the theatrical cut the rest versions are pure crap with lameness. The original cut kicks ass!!! Great movie! This movie is so silly, that it's actually funny. I have always loved Army of Darkness and I always will. I love this film to death!!!! I was watching with my dad this film and even he loved it. So yes I proud to say I love this film and I have enjoyed More than the original The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987)! This film has funny moments, balance, smart genius creativity, great babes, mystic forces and mystic knights in it.Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun. Army of the dead who were actually skeletons were fabulous, the fights were awesome and they and they were highly enjoyable. The film was fast paced from the beginning till the end. I am sorry if you guys love Evil Dead 2 much better than this film, I just love Army of Darkness much better, this film is just a great worthy sequel to their predecessors. Ash is like ably hero on screen and he is one of the most popular hero's till it's days. Army of Darkness is a classic. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & the special effects masters KNB! You cant ask for more. Great story, funny lines, fantastic looking monsters. I don't care what anyone says I just love this film to death!!! What we get in here is a hybrid of sorts with Bruce Campbell once again as Ash the reluctant hero fighting ghouls and goblins (well maybe not goblins) in the medieval times. This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. The movie is not as annoying as the previous 2 films and closes out the trilogy nicely. They are a lot of talks of an Army of Darkness 2 and I don't want any sequel to this horror/comedy flick. I thought this film closed the trilogy beautiful. There is a lots of comic relief, over the top cuts, BOOMSTICK!!!!! Army of Darkness is my second favorite movie (Evil Dead II, Dark Knight, ARMY OF DARKNESS) and here's why. It follows the character of Ashley (Ash) J. Williams in his journey to the past that is far better explained in Evil Dead II. He is only able to be sent back to his own time (and his job at S Mart) if he finds the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) which will also free the people who can help him from the attacks of the deadites. Ash has to find the book, get the babe, fight some demons, and get back home...like in the deal. This movie has it all, and some sugar, baby! It is a hilarious, gory, wonderful display of Bruce Campbell's ingenious acting ability, and anyone who says differently is a deadite. It's a film that would make Clive Barker proud. An oddball yet absolutely successful pairing of slapstick Comedy and undead Horror with a medieval setting thrown into the mix for good measure, 1992's Army of Darkness sits proudly near the top of the list of most unconventional yet absolutely entertaining motion pictures in history. Following up on 1981's oft-banned The Evil Dead and 1987's The Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (itself a Horror-Comedy hybrid), Army of Darkness represents the most accessible and audience-friendly of the three. Special effects; gore; humor; and of course, Bruce Campbell's over-the-top antics are Awesome!!! Hail to the king, baby.Army of Darkness is a 1992 American dark fantasy action comedy film directed by Sam Raimi. It is the third installment of the Evil Dead franchise. The film was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell (also acting as co-producer) and Embeth Davidtz. Continuing from Evil Dead II, Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.Beyond in human flesh, inked in blood-and amazingly hard to pronounce-the ancient "Necronomicon" (Book of the Dead) unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic. Back to do battle with the hideous "Deadites," Bruce Campbell reprises his role from the Evil Dead series as Ash, the handsome, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time warp him-and his '73 Oldsmobile-into England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the dead, rescue his girlfriend and get back to his own time? This movie is personal second favorite movie it is 10/10.

This frightening , strikingly designed horror/comedy movie achieved a lot of success thanks to its unstopped terror and humor , including continuous resemblances to the original version also directed by Sam Raimi . It deals with a 20th century guy , Ash (Bruce Campbell, first and last studio film he starred in as the lead) , none too bright hero , who finds himself trapped in the middle ages . As Ash along with his car , his shotgun, and his chainsaw is accidentally transported to 1300 A.D., there he finds the ¨Book of the Dead¨ in which unwittingly emerge resurrect demons . Soon he is discovered and thought to be a spy for a rival called Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and is taken prisoner . He is freed and confronts a nasty witch (Patricia Tallman) and Duke Henry the Red (Richard Grove) . Later on , square-jawed Ash must fight an army of ghouls and generally causes all those wreak havoc . Menwhile , he romances a babe , Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) , and attempts to retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home . A scary , tongue firmly in cheek sequel of the original festival of gore and gags in which an ancient book of magic , Necronomicon , invokes a crowd of joke-tossing , flesh-snacking skeletons . Exuberately gory and filled of guts flick , this is a big-budgeter film , while its predecessors were short-budget . This comic book extravaganza is blending from previous versions ¨Dead evil¨ with creepy creatures submitted a fantastic possession have transformed into flesh eating , being influenced by Ray Harryhausen's skeletons seen in ¨Jason and the Argonauts¨ and ¨Bedknobs and broomsticks¨ . As the entire sequence when Evil Ash grows out of Ash's shoulder starting with an eye is identical the 1959 b-movie 'The Manster' . Highly adequate make up and excellent special effect with enjoyable monstrous creatures and apparent technological exuberance . It must be stated that this is one of the grossest , disgusting and most brutally unnerving movies in the nineties . A fun retelling providing chills , hilarious situations and grisly horror and isn't apt for squeamish neither feeble stomachs . This independently produced gem features sets and production standards but is skillfully narrated and results to be an exciting horror/comedy film . Sympathetic acting by Bruce Campbell as hero hurled back to the 14th-century through the powers of an evil book and attempts to get back to his own time . Although Bruce Campbell was displeased with the studio's delayed release of the film and their re-editing of it , as he stated he wasted a year of his life waiting for the film to get released to cinemas . Thriilng as well as rousing musical score by Joseph LoDuca. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Bill Pope . All 3 films can be seamlessly cut together , including some introductory footage in the follow-ups . The first installment was ¨Evil dead¨(1983) by Sam Raimi with Betsy Baker , Theresa Tilly and Bruce Campbell who finds ¨The Necronomicon¨, dealing with a group of friends are vacationing in Tennessee woods when go into a mountain cabin and they find the book of the dead , then begins a possession demoniac and they undergo an eerie changing at night and going on a murderous rampage . Followed by two sequels with similar actor (Bruce Campbell) , producer (Robert Tapert by Renaissance pictures) , musician (Joseph LoDuca) and well directed by Sam Raimi . As ¨Evil dead 2 , Dead by Dawn¨ (1987) in which young people again take refuge in an abandoned cabin and taking place subsequent transformation the students into evil monsters until only Ash remains to battle the evil . This ¨Army of darkness¨ was stunningly directed by Sam Raimi with great originality , though takes parts here and there , too . It's become a cult favorite thanks to its relentless terror , irony , graphic horror but has still tongue-in-cheek . Well worth watching for terror and gore lovers .

The third--and presumably last--of the Evil Dead movies finds Ash Williams(B-movie supreme ruler Bruce Campbell in full froth)somehow transported(along with his broken down car)in Medieval England,about to do battle,once again,with the undead,with the aid of(among other things) his "boom stick" and his chainsaw. While being a strange man in a strange land,he romances plucky lass Sheila(Embeth Davitz,pre-Schindler's List) and aiding the reluctant natives(among them Ian Abercrombie,MArcus Gilbert and Richard Groce).To me(and I suspect I am not alone on this),one of the neat things about this film is that it moves at such a rip-roaring pace that one has little time to catch their breath or even add up the absurdity of the story. But,to quote another commenter,Who cares? This offering,which pretty much eschews the original Evil Dead's Horror premise,and capitalizes on more of the crazed,feverish pacing of Evil Dead 2,seems content to offer large doses of humor mixed with raucous violence and only the thinnest character exposition. Bully for director/co-writer Sam Raimi,co-writer Ivan Raimi and company on this! This is a great "palate-cleanser" of a movie and is a solid party film(among other occasions),whether you're fans of Campbell,Raimi,berserker action films,comedies or all four.

This is the third and final installment of the "Evil Dead" series. Like the second in the series, it was filled with "campy" humor. With director Sam Raimi, you know it's done with a lot of tongue-and-check, if not totally tongue-in-cheek. If not, it would have to be classified as one of the all- time dumbest movies ever made.If it weren't the language (Bruce Campbell, in the lead, provides lots of profanity), this would be a film little kids would love with all the non-stop action and Three Stooges-like slapstick humor. The violence is so prevalent it just gets too much and the film is only 80 minutes long! The humor helps take off some of the edge of the violence.What you have is a medieval-horror-comedy film with Campbell fighting an army of skeletons, a la Jason And The Argonauts. Campbell is best at making goofy faces. Embeth Davidtz provides the romantic interest.

Evil Dead 3 goes by many different AKAs. However even though the film is nearly 20 years old and was low budget even then it still holds up. It remains unbelievably quotable and helped make Bruce Campbell move from a B movie actor into a B Movie Star, and the director Sam Raimi a bona fide Hollywood big shot, I think the Spiderman films might've helped though In the first 5 minutes Raimi effortlessly manages to catch us up on the first two films by showing the summarised backstory, only now including new scenes and events that featured Bridget Fonda as Ash's lady friend, and introducing his S-Mart career. Only a few details actually line up with the events of the first two films – which were in reality the same film made twice anyway – but who cares when the new elements are this fun? In short we rejoin Ash as he is dragged inexorably into another dimension by the forces of evil, ending up in an earlier time of (say) the 1200s, when men were men, demons were prevalent and a constant threat, and American people spoke with thick and contrived British accents – especially the extras.Ash immediately finds himself stuck between two warring factions, the heavily armed castle fortress of Arthur and his men, and the (allegedly) vicious and desperate forces of Henry the Red – so named due to his amazing flaming mullet. Both sides believe the other are responsible for bringing the evil to wreak havoc on one and all.After Ash hilariously proves that he is neither a "Deadite" nor a disciple of Henry the Red – and with his shotgun nor is he a man to be f*cked with – the local "wise one" declares him the "One" that has been foretold (look out Keanu, Eddie Murphy et al).On hearing this and enjoying the subsequent grovelling and fawning that the desperate villages bestow upon him Ash reverts back to the wisecracking, self centred and cocky character that he gradually morphed into in ED2 – though it must be said that this attitude get ratcheted up a few notches with this film. If Evil Dead was a horror film with a few chuckles, and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn was a horror-comedy, Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness is a comedy-horror, with perhaps 75% laughs and 25% scares and gore. But even the scares are more funny and the gore is more played for laughs than gasps.Ash heads off to find the magical Book of the Dead – the Necronomicon – which will banish the forces of evil and allow Ash to head back to his own time and minimum wage job. Of course his solo quest is destined to never run smoothly, and over the journey Ash must face and defeat a series of mini Ashes (in an amazingly creative Must-see scene), his evil doppelganger Evil Ash and his interred horde of undead minions who range from mere skeletons to more recently deceased zombie soldiers.Along the way there is much over the top gore and action, some witty and incredibly arrogant dialogue, some "Three Stooges" homages and the extraordinary physical acting abilities of a young Bruce Campbell. He and Raimi are well acknowledged as longtime best friends, and they obviously had a ball making this film and threw everything but the kitchen sink into it amazing considering this is only an 80 odd minute film depending on which version you have. Raimi is well know for reveling in the on screen torture of pal Bruce so in the film Ash must perform some incredible "backwards acting", get attacked by flying and biting books, get attacked by underground bones and perform lengthy and intricate sword fighting combinations.The evil dead soldiers are often shown in stop motion animation, and there are some shots that I would guess are either homages or were influenced by the work of Harryhausen. Perhaps if they made the same film today CGI might make it look prettier and make some of the actions of the undead a little less herky-jerky, but it wouldn't make the film any better. Every one of the apparently precious few dollars can be seen on screen, with the diminished budget demanding that the film-makers and crew simply had to be more creative than ever before.Thankfully Raimi, Campbell and co were up to the task, the rough edges of Army of Darkness don't detract from the film at all, if anything they make it funnier. A scene in which one of Evil Ash's generals asks for orders and then rides off is hilarious when you look at the General's riding partner who is obviously little more than a skeleton shaped scarecrow, and the appearance of an unwitting crew member in the original version is another quirky and amusing oversight that enhances my enjoyment of this brilliant film.The Evil Dead trilogy already represents some of the best examples, in horror, horror-comedy and simply comedy in cinematic history.Not a bad effort for a few blokes with a miniscule budget and a few crazy ideas. After all look at what Michael Bay can do with hundreds of millions of dollars and ask yourself is that better? I'll break the suspense for you: Hell no it isn't! Final Rating – 9.5 / 10. A brilliant conclusion to one of the better trilogies in cinema history. Ash will go down as one of the horror genre's defining characters.P.S. I know a remake is slated for release next year, with a 0% chance of improvement on the originals why bother?

An American horror-adventure; A story about a man who finds himself trapped in medieval times. He must quest for a book of evil which can return him to his time. Unfortunately, he releases the evil trapped inside the book. The third in the film series finally proves the point that there is no substitute for a good story and high production values. Evil Dead III is funny, well acted, and consistent in pacing throughout. It retains all of the familiar tropes of the original - gore and slapstick humour - but less of the blood-soaked insanity of the previous two instalments. It is more of a cartoonish sword-and-sorcery fantasy, albeit one with some imaginative monsters and special effects with a horror element attached to it.

Oh, come on, you just gotta love this. Whether a girl or a snotty old man, this movie is funny. Bruce Campbell overdoes himself into this goofy comedy, transforming scene after scene into a laughing contest. One just has to see this.Seeing the first two movies as well, I think I realize how this one came to be. I think that most of the times artists allow themselves to have fun at their own work, jewels of comedy emerge. I would just love a fourth movie in the Evil Dead series.Funny thing, though, as this is the most successful of the movies, I have seen it quite a few times, on video, TV or my computer. I can vaguely remember that one of the movies had an ending when the guy found himself in a far post-apocalyptic future after getting the potion, while in others he was in a supermarket, attacked by a demon. Were there two endings to this movie?=== yup, searched it up in the trivia, it had two endings :)

I watched this once as a child so I remember virtually none of it. All I know is that it will be a lot different to what I imagined it to be since it's so old.The movie has definitely aged and some things that Ash does are a bit on the bizarre side of human behaviour. Ash's relationship with Sheila is so weird, they only met like 20min ago and now they are a "thing". The ending was so wild and ridiculous, I'm astonished at the way they wrote this movie. The special effects are garbage, movie even has some stop motion in it. The humour is questionable, maybe it was something people found funny back in the 90s but not today.Diologue is cringe. Basically by today's standards this movie is awful but it would fly in the 90s, which it did.I wouldn't personally call it horror because they were going for more humour here but it is still considered that so whatever.

What would you do, if you're chucked into a flue, that takes your mind, body and soul, and throws you down a wide wormhole, regurgitates you back in time, an ancient world that is not fine, like the one you've left behind, demons down pits you will now find, you head off in search of the evil book, the one that looks back, when you take a look, the one that bites if you come too close, the one that you should keep quite seriously closed, it's not long before the army of unfed, are on a warfront for some fattening bread, sticks and stones may break their bones, these folk are far from being quite toned.Not as good or as funny as I'd remembered it.

At the end of Evil Dead 2 Ash is sucked back in time through a time warp. He returns to medieval times where he is mistaken for the prophesied saviour.  He is sent to recover the lost Necronomicon to save the people but also return him to his own time.  Typically he makes a mistake when reading the book and he reserectes the army of the undead onto the land.  Ash must fight to defeat yet more undead fiends!The third in the series sees the gore drop off and the comedy step up even more.  The previous two were both darkly funny but this is just plain hilarious.  The sheer raft of one liners and silly/horror set ups keeps you laughing all the way.  The horror is not scary as before  mainly because the gore is gone, however I prefer this as the stop motion stuff gives it an old fashioned feel that adds to the value of it  it's hard to explain but I really enjoy this because it feels like an old Harryhausen film.Campbell is brilliant  I bet he can't believe hi s luck, the rest of his career he's struggled but Rami seem to love him.  And rightly so, he is like Jim Carrey but has so much more talent and is a classic B-movie leading man type.  The rest of the cast are so-so but really this is an one man show and he does it really well.Overall this is a great little film.  Fans of the series will love it, fans of comedy should love it and fans of B-movie cheese should enjoy it.  And the less gore means fun for all the family (almost).

Well, at least I found it to be hilarious. I really did get into the Evil Dead series, it was so silly how it even started. I just happened to have a Blockbuster gift card and bought a pre-viewed "Evil Dead" and my mom had watched it with me. Strange, right? Well, because of her, I got to see one of the best movie trilogies of all time. Not to mention I couldn't believe the fan base these movies have. So it's good to know that I'm not alone.Army of Darkness starts where Evil Dead 2 left off. Ashley has now gone back in time to the mid-evil times where he has to find a way back to his time. But the people he has met through this time think that he is the one who will save them all from the evil dead. They promise to help him find a way back if he saves them. Along that journey, he meets a beautiful peasant girl, Sheila, and they have a romantic affair. Along his journey to save the people, he must retrieve the "Book of the Dead", but when he slurs the words and does a half assed job of it, the book rises an evil twin of Ash's and leads his Army of Darkness to destroy the village Ash has promised to save.This movie has great laughs and is a great end to this terrific trilogy. You won't regret seeing it, trust me.10/10

Ash (Bruce Campbell) is transported with his car to 1,300 A.D., where he is captured by Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and turned slave with Duke Henry the Red (Richard Grove) and a couple of his men. When Ash is thrown into a pit, he defeats two monsters and wins respect of Arthur's army and vassals. The Wiseman (Ian Abercrombie) points Ash as The Chosen One that will retrieve the Necronomicon but Ash is only interested in returning home. When he learns that the only way to return to his time is using the Necronomicon, Ash decides to travel to the unholy land of the Deadites. The Wiseman advises that he must say the words "Klaatu Barada Nikto" to safely get the evil book. However, Ash forgets the last word and an army of the dead resurrects to attack Arthur fortress and recover the Necronomicon. The battle between the living and the dead is about to start and the support of Henry the Red is the only way to help Ash and Arthur to defeat the army of darkness. "Army of Darkness" is one of my favorite cult-movies and one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Bruce Campbell, who is one of the best actors of B-movies with Jeffrey Combs, has a fantastic performance and is hilarious. I do not know how many times I have seen this film, but today I have watched it in an excellent DVD released by the Brazilian Distributor Cult Classic, with alternative ending and four deleted scenes. The phrase that Ash is supposed to say is a tribute to the 1951 masterpiece "The Day the Earth Stood Still". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Uma Noite Alucinante 3" ("One Hallucinating Night 3")Note: On 24 July 2016, I saw this film again.

The evil dead films go from horror with some black comedy to a horror and comedy mix to this rather innocent adventure comedy. Army of Darkness has more in common with Hercules and Xena than the first two evil dead movies. This does not take away from the fact that this is a faithful sequel. Bruce Campbell has all the fun as he performs Three Stooges routines, goes a little Gulliver, romances a babe, and kills his evil self twice. The battle of Oldsmobile is the highlight as Ash takes on an army mixed of Ray Harryhausen skeletons and KNB zombies. The voices, the sliding dagger skeletons, and the hi ho hi ya make the battle super cool. The silliness is sometimes stupid(shoe laces?) but mostly hits the mark, mostly.*Evil Ash: I am bad Ash, you're good Ash. Your little goody two shoes! Little goody two shoes! Little goody two shoes!*

If you have seen the previous installments, the Evil Dead 1 and 2, you know what to expect from this movie. If you haven't, prepared to be shocked and impressed.When I first saw Army of Darkness I had not seen the previous installments in the loosely called 'series'. I had no expectations, but right from the start of the film, it becomes clear that you are to relax, free your mind, and laugh as hard as you can.Army of Darkness has no flaws in my opinion. It is perfectly paced and this is the role Bruce Campbell was born to play. The film sets a unique tone that not many movies can. It focuses more on comedy than gore unlike it's predecessors, but it works well in it's favor.Once you watch it, you will have unlimited quotes to use with your friends. I still quote it to this day, and its been 20 years later. If you don't see this movie, you haven't lived life yet. Gimmie some sugar, baby.

''Army of Darkness '' is one of those horror movies that I consider to be more of a comedy with gory elements, then really a '' horror''. First because of Bruce Campbell,that in his role as ''Ash'', reminds me Jim Carrey a lot. Second because of the errors(like a Crew member or an equipment being visible in the movie)that are not edited, the cheesy skeletons and the primary effects of the movie. The beginning and the end of the Evil Dead I,II, and Army of Darkness, almost doesn't match up as well, but the good thing is that you don't need to watch them in sequence to the plot make sense.Our hero Ash, in this movie,is sucked into a time vortex with his Oldsmobile,into the England in AD 1300, where he is believed to be the "Hero From The Sky," the man destined to deliver mankind to salvation from the "Deadites," or the undead. To get into the future again, Ash needs to take the Necronomicon (book of the dead) and say the magical words ''Clatto Verata Nicto'', but our smart hero unleashes the forces of the Deadites,since he was unable to recall the precise magic words. Now he has an army of monsters do destroy,before going to his century again.

I simply love this movie. It is one of the classics in my opinion. It may not be that well known but when I first saw it I was captivated by the siege of the undead on the castle and loved it so much that I returned and saw it later at the cinema again. Now every so often I see it in the video store and go and hire it. When I recently hired it I noticed that they had released a directors cut with a different ending. Usually the director's cut is a little better that the original but I don't know with this one. I did like the original ending where he is back in S-Mart and blows away the witch that attacks him, grabs the girl, says "hail to the king, Baby," and kisses her. It is such a cool image.Army of Darkness is labelled as black comedy but I would also put it under the category of satire. What we are laughing at is not just death but also the arrogance of the average American redneck. The cover is that of a comic book movie and the shelf it was on at the local video library was "Cult Movies". I remember Evil Dead back when I was a kid. There was a computer game based on it and it was described as the most scariest film ever made. The trilogy originally began as a horror but I was told that when Evil Dead III came around, Raimi decided that the horror genre was so worn out it drifted into comedy.Ash (Bruce Cambell) went on a retreat with his girlfriend and found the necronomicon, the evil book of the dead. The book killed his girlfriend and tried to possess him but he fought it off. The book struck back and dragged him into the past to medieval England where he is captured by the local lord with Henry the Red. He manages to redeem himself and goes on a quest to find the book to get him back to his own time but unfortunately he awakens the dead and they swarm the castle to get it back.What makes this movie great is the individualist attitude of Ash. He is great because he has a gun and a chainsaw and nobody else does. He has attitude and basically acts like your everyday average rednecked American, and this stands out in the background of Medieval England. Unlike most time travel movies, he does not try to blend in, nor does he hide his technology. He simply shoves it in their face "This is my BOOM stick!" and says that if anybody gets in his way he will blow their brains out. Even though he has his boom stick, this does not stop the people from turning away from him when he reveals his individualistic streak. That is he awakens the dead and then wants to return home. No matter how great his boom stick is, the awe that they held in him is gone.All I can say is that I love this movie. I will pay money for it for the simple pleasure of having it in my collection. It goes beyond a simple fantasy/Horror/Comedy movie to that of cult status. It is great and deserves that position on the video store shelf.Favourite quote: I hate to burst your bubble but you are in charge of only two things, Jack and S**t, and Jack just left town.

Army Of Darkness (1992): Bruce Campbell, Richard Grove, Marcus Gilbert, Ian Abercrombie, Embeth Davidtz, Timothy Patrick Quill, Bridget Fonda, Patricia Tallman, Ted Raimi, Bruce Thomas, Sara Shearer, Shiva Gordon, Billy Bryan, Bill Moseley, Nadine Grycan, Andy Bale, Robert Brent Lappin, Rad Milo, Brad Bradbury, Lorraine Axeman, Sol Abrams, Josh Becker, David O'Malley, Ivan Raimi, Bernard Rose, Bill Vincent, Ron Zwang...Director Sam Raimi, Screenplay Sam Raimi, Ivan Raimi.Army of Darkness, released in 1992, came as a pleasant surprise to fans of director Sam Raimi's films, namely the "Evil Dead" series. In it, Bruce Campbell plays Ash, a man whose girlfriend is killed by demons and zombies in the backwoods, a man forced to fight the undead with his chain saw and gun. Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash for this film. Ash tells his fellow supermarket co-workers that he had traveled in time to the Middle Ages and had the chance to become king. A kingdom is in trouble as an army of the undead is forming. Ash is suddenly whisked away to this medieval world, equipped only with his car, his chain saw and gun. Before long, he becomes the kingdom's only hope for salvation from the demonic forces. His mission is to read from a book of the dead and recite the magic words. But there's a problem. He forgets the last word. The consequences are dire. An army of skeletons and demons begin to attack the kingdom. The premise to this film, if handled as less of a comedy, would be pure adventure-horror and fantasy. But as it is, this film is more of a dark comedy filled with computer-enhanced visual effects, this coming at a time at the beginning of the 1990's when such devices for film-making were very new. To some, this film is B movie hell. To others, this film is a feel-good film, a comedy dressed up as horror and adventure. Bruce Campbell, whose career owed to Sam Raimi, is doing his usual thing - slapstick comedy, physical comedy, witty comic lines. He is a sort of comic swashbuckler and this would be his most famed identity as an actor. He would later appear in television's "Xena Warrior Princess" as the King of Thieves, and more recently in the "Spider Man" films which were also directed by Sam Raimi. Coincidentally, Joseph LoDuca provides the music for this film, and he would work with Sam Raimi again for other films and also on Xena. The film is probably nothing terrific, and is really more of a comedy for grown-ups but it's enjoyable nonetheless. It's a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a refreshing stray from the traditional zombie films. However, perhaps due to some of the language and mild violence, this film is more appropriate for pre-teens (13 and up)but not for young and sensitive children. An entertaining, hilarious horror film for an acquired taste in Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.

The third time really is the charm, and "Army of Darkness" proves it incontrovertibly. This time, they just let the movie be what the first two movies were at heart: nice, silly, goofy, wacko, nonsensical fun. Just imagine the Three Stooges starring in a horror flick and you've got "Army of Darkness". The whole movie basically consists of Ash (Bruce Campbell) going after various evil spirits in the funniest way possible. And the quotes are some of the most hilarious quotes that you could ever imagine, probably mostly owing to how Bruce Campbell says them. Literally every scene is pure hilarity. Whether it's Ash showing his "boomstick", having trouble retrieving the book, battling mini-Ashes, or the big battle at the end, you never stop laughing yourself hoarse (I particularly liked some of the bone-related quotes). It doesn't even suffice to give this movie 10/10 stars. It deserves 100...no, a million...no, infinity out of 10 stars. Yeah, infinity out of 10 stars. Bruce Campbell not only deserves a star on the Walk of Fame, there needs to be a statue of him.Oh, and an extra note. When I went to see "Bubba Ho-Tep" in the theater, Bruce Campbell was supposed to be there, but had to cancel. So, there was a short clip at the beginning showing him thanking us for coming, when his phone rang: "Hello...Oh, hi Sam. Listen, I'll get to you in a minute." (turns to audience) "So thanks for coming to this movie." (retrieves his phone) "Yeah, Sam?..."Evil Dead 4"?! I'll do it!"I just wonder how they would continue the story, now that Ash battled skeletons with his "boomstick".

this third movie in the Evil Dead franchise is superior two the two previous movies,especially the second one,which was a pile of dreck in my opinion.this one though is very funny,and clever.it's lighter in tone.the story is much better.there are some very witty one liners.it's hard to believe this is part of the Evil dead franchise.but even if you're not familiar with the series you can still enjoy this particular film,as it works well as a stand alone movie.either way,it's a lot of fun.the only complaint i have is the length.at under 80 minutes,i found it a bit short.i think it could have been a bit longer.that's a minor issue.otherwise,i'd highly recommend it.for me,Army of Darkness is a 7/10

This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, I'm not even going to waste my time giving it a lengthy review.How did they manage to create this as a sequel yet completely ignore how the last film ended?Also, if you find this funny, I feel sorry for you, the humour is incredibly childish and slapstick, I'm assuming you're a stoner if you rate this film highly.Ash's character appears to have completely changed, why is he suddenly so heroic and badass, and when did he become so arrogant and ignorant, how did he become a slave when at the end of the first film he was being praised as a saviour? This film should begin with a note saying "If you enjoyed Evil Dead 1 & 2 for it's gore and subtle humour, this probably is not the film for you."

Picking up where "Evil Dead II" left off in a somewhat altered opening, Bruce Campbell, now a full blown Han Solo smart ass, is trapped in the dark ages and is eventually found to be the one fated to the Deadites after he retrieves the Book of the Dead, which can also help send him back to his own time. But Bruce, being as stupid as he is, screws up the magic words that are meant to keep the Army of Darkness away and he ends up unleashing an army of undead skeletons by accident who are led by his evil alter ego. Now he must use his 20th century know how to save the day or else evil will forever rule the Earth. Bruce is back and funnier than ever. No real horror here, more of a parody of a big budget fantasy adventure film. Sadly, a number of great gags were left on the cutting room floor that are generally only seen on extended DVD's and TV showings. Hail to the King, baby.

I remember when this film just came out in the theater, I didn't know anything about the Evil Dead films and in fact hadn't even heard of them. From the previews I had ZERO desire to see this film.  The years went by and in late 2000 or maybe 2001 I finally decided to watch it, cause I'd heard so much about it and just couldn't take it anymore, I had to see what the fuss was about.  I was NOT disappointed!  This is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!!!This movie is definitely not for everyone though.  The comedy in this film is VERY odd, so I could understand if someone didn't find it funny at first. First thing you need to keep in mind is that this movie IS NOT trying to be serious, and most definitely doesn't take itself seriously.  The movie is just plain weird, but that's what makes it so great.  You really can't explain this movie to someone that hasn't seen it, you just need to see it for yourself.Also, if you didn't already know this, this is the 3rd installment to a series.  Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are the first two installments, then Army Of Darkness.  You don't even need to see the first two to understand what's going on or anything like that.  In fact, to this day I still haven't seen Evil Dead.  When I watched Army of Darkness, I hadn't seen either Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2.  Since then, I have seen Evil Dead 2, but neither film is a prerequisite for this film.Also this film has an enormous amount of quotable lines.  Bruce Campbell is THE MAN!  The way he says stuff is just great!Well, I truly hope that you'll watch this movie.  But watch it with an open mind and remember that this IS a STUPID movie, but it's supposed to be. Thanks for reading,-Chris

It's not good as "Evil Dead 2" but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good.7.9/10

Most people would say you can check your brain at the door before you watch this film, but I beg to differ.  This is genuinely intelligent stuff here folks.  The director, Sam Raimi, reminds us in this film what it is like to have fun.  From the film itself, as well as the DVD featurettes, it is apparent that Mr. Raimi is having a blast doing what he does best.  It shows too.  Granted, there is not much in the line of plot or theme, but these would be totally gratuitous in this escapist piece.  Instead, we are given a fantastic adventure, appropriately tongue-in-cheek special effects, and an ode to The Three Stooges.  The facial expressions of Bruce Campbell alone make this film well worth its 80 minutes.  I don't want to give away a single joke, because the experience is just too much fun.  So, do yourself a favor.  Watch this film without being so hard on yourself.  Yes, you are allowed to laugh.  There can be non-sardonic humor in modern day America. Sam Raimi proves it.

Okay, maybe it's more comedy than horror, but who cares? Army of Darkness is an awesome movie. Bruce Campbell does an excellent job as Ash, the arrogant and hilarious hero armed with his trusty chainsaw and 'boom stick'. The plot was great and fresh, showing that the people behind the scenes were not trying to do the same thing that made Evil Dead I & II popular. The movie is filled with sword swinging skeletons, kick boxing witches and slap stick. Bruce Campbell has some excellent one liners. To sum it up, Army of Darkness is groovy.But you can let it end here. Give us another sequel please.

Army of Darkness (1992) is in my opinion by far the best one of the "Evil Dead" trilogy! It is my second favorite film of the trilogy, I just love, love this movie to death!!!! It is my personal favorite horror movie in the Evil Dead series. The best one is the theatrical cut the rest versions are pure crap with lameness. The original cut kicks ass!!! Great movie! This movie is so silly, that it's actually funny. I have always loved Army of Darkness and I always will. I love this film to death!!!! I was watching with my dad this film and even he loved it. So yes I proud to say I love this film and I have enjoyed More than the original The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987)! This film has funny moments, balance, smart genius creativity, great babes, mystic forces and mystic knights in it.Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun. Army of the dead who were actually skeletons were fabulous, the fights were awesome and they and they were highly enjoyable. The film was fast paced from the beginning till the end. I am sorry if you guys love Evil Dead 2 much better than this film, I just love Army of Darkness much better, this film is just a great worthy sequel to their predecessors. Ash is like ably hero on screen and he is one of the most popular hero's till it's days. Army of Darkness is a classic. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & the special effects masters KNB! You cant ask for more. Great story, funny lines, fantastic looking monsters. I don't care what anyone says I just love this film to death!!! What we get in here is a hybrid of sorts with Bruce Campbell once again as Ash the reluctant hero fighting ghouls and goblins (well maybe not goblins) in the medieval times. This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. The movie is not as annoying as the previous 2 films and closes out the trilogy nicely. They are a lot of talks of an Army of Darkness 2 and I don't want any sequel to this horror/comedy flick. I thought this film closed the trilogy beautiful. There is a lots of comic relief, over the top cuts, BOOMSTICK!!!!! Army of Darkness is my second favorite movie (Evil Dead II, Dark Knight, ARMY OF DARKNESS) and here's why. It follows the character of Ashley (Ash) J. Williams in his journey to the past that is far better explained in Evil Dead II. He is only able to be sent back to his own time (and his job at S Mart) if he finds the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) which will also free the people who can help him from the attacks of the deadites. Ash has to find the book, get the babe, fight some demons, and get back home...like in the deal. This movie has it all, and some sugar, baby! It is a hilarious, gory, wonderful display of Bruce Campbell's ingenious acting ability, and anyone who says differently is a deadite. It's a film that would make Clive Barker proud. An oddball yet absolutely successful pairing of slapstick Comedy and undead Horror with a medieval setting thrown into the mix for good measure, 1992's Army of Darkness sits proudly near the top of the list of most unconventional yet absolutely entertaining motion pictures in history. Following up on 1981's oft-banned The Evil Dead and 1987's The Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (itself a Horror-Comedy hybrid), Army of Darkness represents the most accessible and audience-friendly of the three. Special effects; gore; humor; and of course, Bruce Campbell's over-the-top antics are Awesome!!! Hail to the king, baby.Army of Darkness is a 1992 American dark fantasy action comedy film directed by Sam Raimi. It is the third installment of the Evil Dead franchise. The film was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell (also acting as co-producer) and Embeth Davidtz. Continuing from Evil Dead II, Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.Beyond in human flesh, inked in blood-and amazingly hard to pronounce-the ancient "Necronomicon" (Book of the Dead) unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic. Back to do battle with the hideous "Deadites," Bruce Campbell reprises his role from the Evil Dead series as Ash, the handsome, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time warp him-and his '73 Oldsmobile-into England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the dead, rescue his girlfriend and get back to his own time? This movie is personal second favorite movie it is 10/10.

This frightening , strikingly designed horror/comedy movie achieved a lot of success thanks to its unstopped terror and humor , including continuous resemblances to the original version also directed by Sam Raimi . It deals with a 20th century guy , Ash (Bruce Campbell, first and last studio film he starred in as the lead) , none too bright hero , who finds himself trapped in the middle ages . As Ash along with his car , his shotgun, and his chainsaw is accidentally transported to 1300 A.D., there he finds the ¨Book of the Dead¨ in which unwittingly emerge resurrect demons . Soon he is discovered and thought to be a spy for a rival called Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and is taken prisoner . He is freed and confronts a nasty witch (Patricia Tallman) and Duke Henry the Red (Richard Grove) . Later on , square-jawed Ash must fight an army of ghouls and generally causes all those wreak havoc . Menwhile , he romances a babe , Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) , and attempts to retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home . A scary , tongue firmly in cheek sequel of the original festival of gore and gags in which an ancient book of magic , Necronomicon , invokes a crowd of joke-tossing , flesh-snacking skeletons . Exuberately gory and filled of guts flick , this is a big-budgeter film , while its predecessors were short-budget . This comic book extravaganza is blending from previous versions ¨Dead evil¨ with creepy creatures submitted a fantastic possession have transformed into flesh eating , being influenced by Ray Harryhausen's skeletons seen in ¨Jason and the Argonauts¨ and ¨Bedknobs and broomsticks¨ . As the entire sequence when Evil Ash grows out of Ash's shoulder starting with an eye is identical the 1959 b-movie 'The Manster' . Highly adequate make up and excellent special effect with enjoyable monstrous creatures and apparent technological exuberance . It must be stated that this is one of the grossest , disgusting and most brutally unnerving movies in the nineties . A fun retelling providing chills , hilarious situations and grisly horror and isn't apt for squeamish neither feeble stomachs . This independently produced gem features sets and production standards but is skillfully narrated and results to be an exciting horror/comedy film . Sympathetic acting by Bruce Campbell as hero hurled back to the 14th-century through the powers of an evil book and attempts to get back to his own time . Although Bruce Campbell was displeased with the studio's delayed release of the film and their re-editing of it , as he stated he wasted a year of his life waiting for the film to get released to cinemas . Thriilng as well as rousing musical score by Joseph LoDuca. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Bill Pope . All 3 films can be seamlessly cut together , including some introductory footage in the follow-ups . The first installment was ¨Evil dead¨(1983) by Sam Raimi with Betsy Baker , Theresa Tilly and Bruce Campbell who finds ¨The Necronomicon¨, dealing with a group of friends are vacationing in Tennessee woods when go into a mountain cabin and they find the book of the dead , then begins a possession demoniac and they undergo an eerie changing at night and going on a murderous rampage . Followed by two sequels with similar actor (Bruce Campbell) , producer (Robert Tapert by Renaissance pictures) , musician (Joseph LoDuca) and well directed by Sam Raimi . As ¨Evil dead 2 , Dead by Dawn¨ (1987) in which young people again take refuge in an abandoned cabin and taking place subsequent transformation the students into evil monsters until only Ash remains to battle the evil . This ¨Army of darkness¨ was stunningly directed by Sam Raimi with great originality , though takes parts here and there , too . It's become a cult favorite thanks to its relentless terror , irony , graphic horror but has still tongue-in-cheek . Well worth watching for terror and gore lovers .

The third--and presumably last--of the Evil Dead movies finds Ash Williams(B-movie supreme ruler Bruce Campbell in full froth)somehow transported(along with his broken down car)in Medieval England,about to do battle,once again,with the undead,with the aid of(among other things) his "boom stick" and his chainsaw. While being a strange man in a strange land,he romances plucky lass Sheila(Embeth Davitz,pre-Schindler's List) and aiding the reluctant natives(among them Ian Abercrombie,MArcus Gilbert and Richard Groce).To me(and I suspect I am not alone on this),one of the neat things about this film is that it moves at such a rip-roaring pace that one has little time to catch their breath or even add up the absurdity of the story. But,to quote another commenter,Who cares? This offering,which pretty much eschews the original Evil Dead's Horror premise,and capitalizes on more of the crazed,feverish pacing of Evil Dead 2,seems content to offer large doses of humor mixed with raucous violence and only the thinnest character exposition. Bully for director/co-writer Sam Raimi,co-writer Ivan Raimi and company on this! This is a great "palate-cleanser" of a movie and is a solid party film(among other occasions),whether you're fans of Campbell,Raimi,berserker action films,comedies or all four.

This is the third and final installment of the "Evil Dead" series. Like the second in the series, it was filled with "campy" humor. With director Sam Raimi, you know it's done with a lot of tongue-and-check, if not totally tongue-in-cheek. If not, it would have to be classified as one of the all- time dumbest movies ever made.If it weren't the language (Bruce Campbell, in the lead, provides lots of profanity), this would be a film little kids would love with all the non-stop action and Three Stooges-like slapstick humor. The violence is so prevalent it just gets too much and the film is only 80 minutes long! The humor helps take off some of the edge of the violence.What you have is a medieval-horror-comedy film with Campbell fighting an army of skeletons, a la Jason And The Argonauts. Campbell is best at making goofy faces. Embeth Davidtz provides the romantic interest.

Evil Dead 3 goes by many different AKAs. However even though the film is nearly 20 years old and was low budget even then it still holds up. It remains unbelievably quotable and helped make Bruce Campbell move from a B movie actor into a B Movie Star, and the director Sam Raimi a bona fide Hollywood big shot, I think the Spiderman films might've helped though In the first 5 minutes Raimi effortlessly manages to catch us up on the first two films by showing the summarised backstory, only now including new scenes and events that featured Bridget Fonda as Ash's lady friend, and introducing his S-Mart career. Only a few details actually line up with the events of the first two films – which were in reality the same film made twice anyway – but who cares when the new elements are this fun? In short we rejoin Ash as he is dragged inexorably into another dimension by the forces of evil, ending up in an earlier time of (say) the 1200s, when men were men, demons were prevalent and a constant threat, and American people spoke with thick and contrived British accents – especially the extras.Ash immediately finds himself stuck between two warring factions, the heavily armed castle fortress of Arthur and his men, and the (allegedly) vicious and desperate forces of Henry the Red – so named due to his amazing flaming mullet. Both sides believe the other are responsible for bringing the evil to wreak havoc on one and all.After Ash hilariously proves that he is neither a "Deadite" nor a disciple of Henry the Red – and with his shotgun nor is he a man to be f*cked with – the local "wise one" declares him the "One" that has been foretold (look out Keanu, Eddie Murphy et al).On hearing this and enjoying the subsequent grovelling and fawning that the desperate villages bestow upon him Ash reverts back to the wisecracking, self centred and cocky character that he gradually morphed into in ED2 – though it must be said that this attitude get ratcheted up a few notches with this film. If Evil Dead was a horror film with a few chuckles, and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn was a horror-comedy, Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness is a comedy-horror, with perhaps 75% laughs and 25% scares and gore. But even the scares are more funny and the gore is more played for laughs than gasps.Ash heads off to find the magical Book of the Dead – the Necronomicon – which will banish the forces of evil and allow Ash to head back to his own time and minimum wage job. Of course his solo quest is destined to never run smoothly, and over the journey Ash must face and defeat a series of mini Ashes (in an amazingly creative Must-see scene), his evil doppelganger Evil Ash and his interred horde of undead minions who range from mere skeletons to more recently deceased zombie soldiers.Along the way there is much over the top gore and action, some witty and incredibly arrogant dialogue, some "Three Stooges" homages and the extraordinary physical acting abilities of a young Bruce Campbell. He and Raimi are well acknowledged as longtime best friends, and they obviously had a ball making this film and threw everything but the kitchen sink into it amazing considering this is only an 80 odd minute film depending on which version you have. Raimi is well know for reveling in the on screen torture of pal Bruce so in the film Ash must perform some incredible "backwards acting", get attacked by flying and biting books, get attacked by underground bones and perform lengthy and intricate sword fighting combinations.The evil dead soldiers are often shown in stop motion animation, and there are some shots that I would guess are either homages or were influenced by the work of Harryhausen. Perhaps if they made the same film today CGI might make it look prettier and make some of the actions of the undead a little less herky-jerky, but it wouldn't make the film any better. Every one of the apparently precious few dollars can be seen on screen, with the diminished budget demanding that the film-makers and crew simply had to be more creative than ever before.Thankfully Raimi, Campbell and co were up to the task, the rough edges of Army of Darkness don't detract from the film at all, if anything they make it funnier. A scene in which one of Evil Ash's generals asks for orders and then rides off is hilarious when you look at the General's riding partner who is obviously little more than a skeleton shaped scarecrow, and the appearance of an unwitting crew member in the original version is another quirky and amusing oversight that enhances my enjoyment of this brilliant film.The Evil Dead trilogy already represents some of the best examples, in horror, horror-comedy and simply comedy in cinematic history.Not a bad effort for a few blokes with a miniscule budget and a few crazy ideas. After all look at what Michael Bay can do with hundreds of millions of dollars and ask yourself is that better? I'll break the suspense for you: Hell no it isn't! Final Rating – 9.5 / 10. A brilliant conclusion to one of the better trilogies in cinema history. Ash will go down as one of the horror genre's defining characters.P.S. I know a remake is slated for release next year, with a 0% chance of improvement on the originals why bother?

An American horror-adventure; A story about a man who finds himself trapped in medieval times. He must quest for a book of evil which can return him to his time. Unfortunately, he releases the evil trapped inside the book. The third in the film series finally proves the point that there is no substitute for a good story and high production values. Evil Dead III is funny, well acted, and consistent in pacing throughout. It retains all of the familiar tropes of the original - gore and slapstick humour - but less of the blood-soaked insanity of the previous two instalments. It is more of a cartoonish sword-and-sorcery fantasy, albeit one with some imaginative monsters and special effects with a horror element attached to it.

Oh, come on, you just gotta love this. Whether a girl or a snotty old man, this movie is funny. Bruce Campbell overdoes himself into this goofy comedy, transforming scene after scene into a laughing contest. One just has to see this.Seeing the first two movies as well, I think I realize how this one came to be. I think that most of the times artists allow themselves to have fun at their own work, jewels of comedy emerge. I would just love a fourth movie in the Evil Dead series.Funny thing, though, as this is the most successful of the movies, I have seen it quite a few times, on video, TV or my computer. I can vaguely remember that one of the movies had an ending when the guy found himself in a far post-apocalyptic future after getting the potion, while in others he was in a supermarket, attacked by a demon. Were there two endings to this movie?=== yup, searched it up in the trivia, it had two endings :)

I watched this once as a child so I remember virtually none of it. All I know is that it will be a lot different to what I imagined it to be since it's so old.The movie has definitely aged and some things that Ash does are a bit on the bizarre side of human behaviour. Ash's relationship with Sheila is so weird, they only met like 20min ago and now they are a "thing". The ending was so wild and ridiculous, I'm astonished at the way they wrote this movie. The special effects are garbage, movie even has some stop motion in it. The humour is questionable, maybe it was something people found funny back in the 90s but not today.Diologue is cringe. Basically by today's standards this movie is awful but it would fly in the 90s, which it did.I wouldn't personally call it horror because they were going for more humour here but it is still considered that so whatever.

What would you do, if you're chucked into a flue, that takes your mind, body and soul, and throws you down a wide wormhole, regurgitates you back in time, an ancient world that is not fine, like the one you've left behind, demons down pits you will now find, you head off in search of the evil book, the one that looks back, when you take a look, the one that bites if you come too close, the one that you should keep quite seriously closed, it's not long before the army of unfed, are on a warfront for some fattening bread, sticks and stones may break their bones, these folk are far from being quite toned.Not as good or as funny as I'd remembered it.

At the end of Evil Dead 2 Ash is sucked back in time through a time warp. He returns to medieval times where he is mistaken for the prophesied saviour.  He is sent to recover the lost Necronomicon to save the people but also return him to his own time.  Typically he makes a mistake when reading the book and he reserectes the army of the undead onto the land.  Ash must fight to defeat yet more undead fiends!The third in the series sees the gore drop off and the comedy step up even more.  The previous two were both darkly funny but this is just plain hilarious.  The sheer raft of one liners and silly/horror set ups keeps you laughing all the way.  The horror is not scary as before  mainly because the gore is gone, however I prefer this as the stop motion stuff gives it an old fashioned feel that adds to the value of it  it's hard to explain but I really enjoy this because it feels like an old Harryhausen film.Campbell is brilliant  I bet he can't believe hi s luck, the rest of his career he's struggled but Rami seem to love him.  And rightly so, he is like Jim Carrey but has so much more talent and is a classic B-movie leading man type.  The rest of the cast are so-so but really this is an one man show and he does it really well.Overall this is a great little film.  Fans of the series will love it, fans of comedy should love it and fans of B-movie cheese should enjoy it.  And the less gore means fun for all the family (almost).

Well, at least I found it to be hilarious. I really did get into the Evil Dead series, it was so silly how it even started. I just happened to have a Blockbuster gift card and bought a pre-viewed "Evil Dead" and my mom had watched it with me. Strange, right? Well, because of her, I got to see one of the best movie trilogies of all time. Not to mention I couldn't believe the fan base these movies have. So it's good to know that I'm not alone.Army of Darkness starts where Evil Dead 2 left off. Ashley has now gone back in time to the mid-evil times where he has to find a way back to his time. But the people he has met through this time think that he is the one who will save them all from the evil dead. They promise to help him find a way back if he saves them. Along that journey, he meets a beautiful peasant girl, Sheila, and they have a romantic affair. Along his journey to save the people, he must retrieve the "Book of the Dead", but when he slurs the words and does a half assed job of it, the book rises an evil twin of Ash's and leads his Army of Darkness to destroy the village Ash has promised to save.This movie has great laughs and is a great end to this terrific trilogy. You won't regret seeing it, trust me.10/10

Ash (Bruce Campbell) is transported with his car to 1,300 A.D., where he is captured by Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and turned slave with Duke Henry the Red (Richard Grove) and a couple of his men. When Ash is thrown into a pit, he defeats two monsters and wins respect of Arthur's army and vassals. The Wiseman (Ian Abercrombie) points Ash as The Chosen One that will retrieve the Necronomicon but Ash is only interested in returning home. When he learns that the only way to return to his time is using the Necronomicon, Ash decides to travel to the unholy land of the Deadites. The Wiseman advises that he must say the words "Klaatu Barada Nikto" to safely get the evil book. However, Ash forgets the last word and an army of the dead resurrects to attack Arthur fortress and recover the Necronomicon. The battle between the living and the dead is about to start and the support of Henry the Red is the only way to help Ash and Arthur to defeat the army of darkness. "Army of Darkness" is one of my favorite cult-movies and one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Bruce Campbell, who is one of the best actors of B-movies with Jeffrey Combs, has a fantastic performance and is hilarious. I do not know how many times I have seen this film, but today I have watched it in an excellent DVD released by the Brazilian Distributor Cult Classic, with alternative ending and four deleted scenes. The phrase that Ash is supposed to say is a tribute to the 1951 masterpiece "The Day the Earth Stood Still". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Uma Noite Alucinante 3" ("One Hallucinating Night 3")Note: On 24 July 2016, I saw this film again.

The evil dead films go from horror with some black comedy to a horror and comedy mix to this rather innocent adventure comedy. Army of Darkness has more in common with Hercules and Xena than the first two evil dead movies. This does not take away from the fact that this is a faithful sequel. Bruce Campbell has all the fun as he performs Three Stooges routines, goes a little Gulliver, romances a babe, and kills his evil self twice. The battle of Oldsmobile is the highlight as Ash takes on an army mixed of Ray Harryhausen skeletons and KNB zombies. The voices, the sliding dagger skeletons, and the hi ho hi ya make the battle super cool. The silliness is sometimes stupid(shoe laces?) but mostly hits the mark, mostly.*Evil Ash: I am bad Ash, you're good Ash. Your little goody two shoes! Little goody two shoes! Little goody two shoes!*

If you have seen the previous installments, the Evil Dead 1 and 2, you know what to expect from this movie. If you haven't, prepared to be shocked and impressed.When I first saw Army of Darkness I had not seen the previous installments in the loosely called 'series'. I had no expectations, but right from the start of the film, it becomes clear that you are to relax, free your mind, and laugh as hard as you can.Army of Darkness has no flaws in my opinion. It is perfectly paced and this is the role Bruce Campbell was born to play. The film sets a unique tone that not many movies can. It focuses more on comedy than gore unlike it's predecessors, but it works well in it's favor.Once you watch it, you will have unlimited quotes to use with your friends. I still quote it to this day, and its been 20 years later. If you don't see this movie, you haven't lived life yet. Gimmie some sugar, baby.

''Army of Darkness '' is one of those horror movies that I consider to be more of a comedy with gory elements, then really a '' horror''. First because of Bruce Campbell,that in his role as ''Ash'', reminds me Jim Carrey a lot. Second because of the errors(like a Crew member or an equipment being visible in the movie)that are not edited, the cheesy skeletons and the primary effects of the movie. The beginning and the end of the Evil Dead I,II, and Army of Darkness, almost doesn't match up as well, but the good thing is that you don't need to watch them in sequence to the plot make sense.Our hero Ash, in this movie,is sucked into a time vortex with his Oldsmobile,into the England in AD 1300, where he is believed to be the "Hero From The Sky," the man destined to deliver mankind to salvation from the "Deadites," or the undead. To get into the future again, Ash needs to take the Necronomicon (book of the dead) and say the magical words ''Clatto Verata Nicto'', but our smart hero unleashes the forces of the Deadites,since he was unable to recall the precise magic words. Now he has an army of monsters do destroy,before going to his century again.

I simply love this movie. It is one of the classics in my opinion. It may not be that well known but when I first saw it I was captivated by the siege of the undead on the castle and loved it so much that I returned and saw it later at the cinema again. Now every so often I see it in the video store and go and hire it. When I recently hired it I noticed that they had released a directors cut with a different ending. Usually the director's cut is a little better that the original but I don't know with this one. I did like the original ending where he is back in S-Mart and blows away the witch that attacks him, grabs the girl, says "hail to the king, Baby," and kisses her. It is such a cool image.Army of Darkness is labelled as black comedy but I would also put it under the category of satire. What we are laughing at is not just death but also the arrogance of the average American redneck. The cover is that of a comic book movie and the shelf it was on at the local video library was "Cult Movies". I remember Evil Dead back when I was a kid. There was a computer game based on it and it was described as the most scariest film ever made. The trilogy originally began as a horror but I was told that when Evil Dead III came around, Raimi decided that the horror genre was so worn out it drifted into comedy.Ash (Bruce Cambell) went on a retreat with his girlfriend and found the necronomicon, the evil book of the dead. The book killed his girlfriend and tried to possess him but he fought it off. The book struck back and dragged him into the past to medieval England where he is captured by the local lord with Henry the Red. He manages to redeem himself and goes on a quest to find the book to get him back to his own time but unfortunately he awakens the dead and they swarm the castle to get it back.What makes this movie great is the individualist attitude of Ash. He is great because he has a gun and a chainsaw and nobody else does. He has attitude and basically acts like your everyday average rednecked American, and this stands out in the background of Medieval England. Unlike most time travel movies, he does not try to blend in, nor does he hide his technology. He simply shoves it in their face "This is my BOOM stick!" and says that if anybody gets in his way he will blow their brains out. Even though he has his boom stick, this does not stop the people from turning away from him when he reveals his individualistic streak. That is he awakens the dead and then wants to return home. No matter how great his boom stick is, the awe that they held in him is gone.All I can say is that I love this movie. I will pay money for it for the simple pleasure of having it in my collection. It goes beyond a simple fantasy/Horror/Comedy movie to that of cult status. It is great and deserves that position on the video store shelf.Favourite quote: I hate to burst your bubble but you are in charge of only two things, Jack and S**t, and Jack just left town.

Army Of Darkness (1992): Bruce Campbell, Richard Grove, Marcus Gilbert, Ian Abercrombie, Embeth Davidtz, Timothy Patrick Quill, Bridget Fonda, Patricia Tallman, Ted Raimi, Bruce Thomas, Sara Shearer, Shiva Gordon, Billy Bryan, Bill Moseley, Nadine Grycan, Andy Bale, Robert Brent Lappin, Rad Milo, Brad Bradbury, Lorraine Axeman, Sol Abrams, Josh Becker, David O'Malley, Ivan Raimi, Bernard Rose, Bill Vincent, Ron Zwang...Director Sam Raimi, Screenplay Sam Raimi, Ivan Raimi.Army of Darkness, released in 1992, came as a pleasant surprise to fans of director Sam Raimi's films, namely the "Evil Dead" series. In it, Bruce Campbell plays Ash, a man whose girlfriend is killed by demons and zombies in the backwoods, a man forced to fight the undead with his chain saw and gun. Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash for this film. Ash tells his fellow supermarket co-workers that he had traveled in time to the Middle Ages and had the chance to become king. A kingdom is in trouble as an army of the undead is forming. Ash is suddenly whisked away to this medieval world, equipped only with his car, his chain saw and gun. Before long, he becomes the kingdom's only hope for salvation from the demonic forces. His mission is to read from a book of the dead and recite the magic words. But there's a problem. He forgets the last word. The consequences are dire. An army of skeletons and demons begin to attack the kingdom. The premise to this film, if handled as less of a comedy, would be pure adventure-horror and fantasy. But as it is, this film is more of a dark comedy filled with computer-enhanced visual effects, this coming at a time at the beginning of the 1990's when such devices for film-making were very new. To some, this film is B movie hell. To others, this film is a feel-good film, a comedy dressed up as horror and adventure. Bruce Campbell, whose career owed to Sam Raimi, is doing his usual thing - slapstick comedy, physical comedy, witty comic lines. He is a sort of comic swashbuckler and this would be his most famed identity as an actor. He would later appear in television's "Xena Warrior Princess" as the King of Thieves, and more recently in the "Spider Man" films which were also directed by Sam Raimi. Coincidentally, Joseph LoDuca provides the music for this film, and he would work with Sam Raimi again for other films and also on Xena. The film is probably nothing terrific, and is really more of a comedy for grown-ups but it's enjoyable nonetheless. It's a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a refreshing stray from the traditional zombie films. However, perhaps due to some of the language and mild violence, this film is more appropriate for pre-teens (13 and up)but not for young and sensitive children. An entertaining, hilarious horror film for an acquired taste in Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.

The third time really is the charm, and "Army of Darkness" proves it incontrovertibly. This time, they just let the movie be what the first two movies were at heart: nice, silly, goofy, wacko, nonsensical fun. Just imagine the Three Stooges starring in a horror flick and you've got "Army of Darkness". The whole movie basically consists of Ash (Bruce Campbell) going after various evil spirits in the funniest way possible. And the quotes are some of the most hilarious quotes that you could ever imagine, probably mostly owing to how Bruce Campbell says them. Literally every scene is pure hilarity. Whether it's Ash showing his "boomstick", having trouble retrieving the book, battling mini-Ashes, or the big battle at the end, you never stop laughing yourself hoarse (I particularly liked some of the bone-related quotes). It doesn't even suffice to give this movie 10/10 stars. It deserves 100...no, a million...no, infinity out of 10 stars. Yeah, infinity out of 10 stars. Bruce Campbell not only deserves a star on the Walk of Fame, there needs to be a statue of him.Oh, and an extra note. When I went to see "Bubba Ho-Tep" in the theater, Bruce Campbell was supposed to be there, but had to cancel. So, there was a short clip at the beginning showing him thanking us for coming, when his phone rang: "Hello...Oh, hi Sam. Listen, I'll get to you in a minute." (turns to audience) "So thanks for coming to this movie." (retrieves his phone) "Yeah, Sam?..."Evil Dead 4"?! I'll do it!"I just wonder how they would continue the story, now that Ash battled skeletons with his "boomstick".

One of the most unrated fantasy flicks ever made, the third part of the the EviL Dead series, Evil Dead 3 The Army of Darkness its a great, funny and unusual adventure and fantasy movie, Ash (Bruce Campell) its an over the edge character who is transported by the powers of a mysterious book, Necromicon to an medieval fantastic era. With the chainsaw in one hand and a shotgun in another, Ash fights against the evil Skeletons Army of the dark ages. Sam Raimi is a great director, the series of 3 movies: "The Evil Dead", "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn" and " Army of Darkness, in my opinion are his 3 master pieces.If you like "Evil Dead 3 Army of Darkness" i recommend:"Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn" and "BrainDead".

This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, I'm not even going to waste my time giving it a lengthy review.How did they manage to create this as a sequel yet completely ignore how the last film ended?Also, if you find this funny, I feel sorry for you, the humour is incredibly childish and slapstick, I'm assuming you're a stoner if you rate this film highly.Ash's character appears to have completely changed, why is he suddenly so heroic and badass, and when did he become so arrogant and ignorant, how did he become a slave when at the end of the first film he was being praised as a saviour? This film should begin with a note saying "If you enjoyed Evil Dead 1 & 2 for it's gore and subtle humour, this probably is not the film for you."
