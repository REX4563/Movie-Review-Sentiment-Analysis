This is a somewhat unusual film; it's a children's film, but it doesn't talk down to its audience. And as an added bonus, it can be watched even if you are over ten. As the far too little-known short Bedhead, Robert Rodriguez has here created a film for children, featuring children... which doesn't treat them with the lack of respect for the smarts and sense of logic that they do already possess. Adults often forget what children are like, and think of them as 'less' than the grownups. Rodriguez gives them(and us) a film that allows them a similar status to adults. The film has stuff that will appeal to kids(spy equipment hidden in children's things) but it isn't offensive to us who aren't. While it is more directed towards those of the preteen persuasion, it doesn't aim so low as to feel stupid for us who aren't of said persuasion. The plot is pretty good, though I guess it's not all that original... and as usual with children's films, the kids are the heroes, which puts too much pressure on them, as a Danish film critic so perfectly put it. The acting is a usual high(as most of the actors are quite talented), no performances really let you down, even the (intentionally)overplayed ones. The characters, many of them fairly clich√©d and thin, are all credible. As with many(most) Rodriguez films, pretty much all of those that he's written, himself... there are subplots and such, many of which are either overly easily resolved or not properly addressed. The humor is pretty good, I laughed out loud several points, rather unusual for children's films, and I was never insulted by the humor. None of it tries too hard to garner laughs, either. The special effects are quite impressive, and though it's still evident that it's Rodriguez' mini studio, it will fool you for the very most part. The action is quite intense and exciting, and like the humor, it's got Rodriguez' unique touch. Any fan of Rodriguez(such as myself, which is by far the main reason I watched this very film in the first place) will enjoy this, if maybe not to the same extent as one of his typical films. I recommend this to any fan of Rodriguez or any of the actors, and definitely most kids. Very much worth watching, even if you've outgrown childhood. Indulge your inner kid. 7/10

"Spy Kids" was a big kids hit! I thought it was pretty cool that there are these two kids Carmen and Juni Cortez who have to save their parents from danger. But I think it could have been better. I didn't really like how they showed how Carmen and Juni's parents got married because seriously, lets get on with the movie!!! But I LOVED the cast. Alexa Vega, i thought was the best one in the cast! She is a great teenage actress and should go really far in the Hollywood movie making business. Daryl Sabara was so cute playing Juni and should go far as well. There was Also Antonio Banderas, and it was an okay movie, not the best, but i expected better.

Of all the kids movies I have seen over the years this was probably the worst.  I took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it.The script seemed to be based on a Willy Wonka style story but it just didn't have anything to it.If you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time, it is bad.They are making a sequel, so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie, but I don't think it is possible.

I watched the first one finally, and have to say that despite the cheesy story plot at times, it wasn't that bad. Some kids find out they are spies and end up having to save their parents from some evil dude. The technology and gadgets are very impressive and funny. I liked the age the kids were, not too old (teenager) but not too young to not be, I guess, easy to relate too.I did find the conclusion a bit cheesy and the characters were at times a little over done, but the special effects and everything was done quite well.I rate this 7/10.

Carmen and Juni Cortez' parents keep an amazing secret from them - before their kids were born they used to be top international spies. When they are kidnapped by the villainous Floop and Minion, who are building a robot army of copies of world leaders' children, the two kids must learn lots of spy stuff fast so they can rescue them. Along the way they enlist the help of their estranged Uncle Machete, escape from the double-agent Miss Gradenko and confront evil robot versions of themselves.This is a wonderful action-packed comedy spy movie which rattles along non-stop and is packed full of funny characters and Rodriguez' tremendous visual style. It somehow manages to romanticise spy movies and cheerfully send them up at the same time, and there are many terrific action/effects scenes (the kids' escape in a mini-submarine, the jetpack chase scene, a helicopter ride). The terrific cast give it their all - I particularly like Gugino, Trejo and Patrick, but everyone is great and Vega and Sabara hit just the right notes as the kids. They are kinda cute, but they argue good-naturedly; Vega has a great long-suffering quality and Sabara is just plain irresistible as the put-upon Juni, who not only has to save the world but get rid of his warts too. The movie is zippily shot by Guillermo Navarro (who has a walk-on as a minister), has some great music by Danny Elfman and features some cool special effects makeup by the Kurtzman/Nicotero/Berger group. Rodriguez made this movie as a labour of love for his children and it shows in every frame - it's just so much fun, and has a great underlying theme of families looking out for each other in the face of crises. He wrote, directed, edited and co-produced the picture, and also co-wrote the music and co-supervised the effects. This is a great director and a man who makes movies to entertain.

I saw the ads and thought SPY KIDS looked awful.  Saw the stills, thought they looked awful (just posing the kids defensively in front of the parents, all in a fighting stance, implies incredible irresponsibility).  I kept reading these wonderful reviews about what a delightful confection this is, and eventually I got suckered in, thinking I didn't want to miss another BABE or something, and the film was probably being poorly marketed to get the kiddies.Well, kiddies might have a good time (though in the theater I attended, restless kids had to be told repeatedly to hush, and one child articulated in the aftermath, "I was hoping for more action").  But this is one where the adults will definitely need to shut their brains off.  If you're on the fence about whether or not to check this out, I'd strongly suggest not going.  It's not awful like CURLY SUE or something -- I laughed aloud once and got a couple of chuckles elsewhere -- but it is... well, it's poor.  The adventure isn't manic enough, the inventions by and large not that incredible (a packet, when microwaved, becomes a McDonald's meal.  Yipee!). SPOILERS AHEAD: Yeah, the thumb thumbs are kinda cool, but the villain is far too toothless.  Kids' movies CAN survive real villainry and, in a way, need it: Wicked Witch of the West, anyone?  And then when the villain goes soft and is revealed as NOT the villain, Villain #2 is even less frightening.SPOILERS OVER.  I guess one of the main problems is that the sense of threat is never tangible. The film has obviously been designed not to frighten children, giving no sense of real evil or malice onscreen (almost all critical physical contact happens either off camera or with simple karate flips).  In cushioning every blow in this manner, SPY KIDS leaves no sense of tension, danger, or conflict.  That's probably why the kids got so shifty during the screening and parents got testy; the kids saw that this emperor had no clothes -- or, more to the point, a candy colored but rather dull one-piece.  5/10

I took my two boys (7 and 10) to see Spy kids today. They were transfixed and wanted to watch it again straightaway. Both are big James Bond fans but some of the content and dialogue of the Bond movies isn't suitable. Spy Kids fits the bill exactly for anyone under 13 who likes the Bond films. It came over to me as a blend of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets Home Alone meets Bond. It was at the kids level without patronizing them and was believable enough for adults to enjoy too. All of the acting was high quality and the special effects first class.I shall enjoy it again in the future on video but it deserves to be seen on the big screen first. Another bonus were the trailers for Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. I often come away from Cinema trips with the kids feeling that we haven't really had our moneys worth, but not today!

Juni and Carmen Cortez are kids whose parents have one secret: they are spies working for the O.S.S. However, the two adults are forced out of retirement after fellow spies are reported to have disappeared, with the father, Gregorio, thinking the spies are mutated into the character of Juni's favorite show, Floop's Fooglies. However, when the two end up getting captured themselves, it's up to Juni and Carmen, who learn of their past from Felix, a man posing as their uncle, to save them, if they can stop arguing with each other to work together.This is a great family film. The action is well choreographed, the actors all do a good job, and the story is nice. But the real good thing here is the special effects. The only problem is Carmen and Juni's bickering can be a bit annoying.

I couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a total drag. Childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes "Legally blonde" look like "The Usual Suspects" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. Well if I were 12, I'd feel insulted. The best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing Carla Gugino that just stole every scene she was in. Sadly, there weren't many. 4/10

This film like the other two were a big part of my childhood so revisiting them for me is quite the nostalgia trip.While compared to today's films this is extremely corny, old, and dated but nonetheless it's a fun film if you can turn your brain off to certain cringe worthy moments. Also the nostalgia definitely helps keep the score up a bit.IMDb: 7/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Watched on HBO Max.

SPY KIDS is a film franchise that I never had any experience of before now. I've just watched the first film for the first time some seventeen years after it was released, and I'm afraid I didn't enjoy the experience. This is a silly, dumbed-down children's film featuring over the top performances from the adult actors and a whole variety of shoddy CGI effects work which looks extremely fake when witnessed in the modern day. The child actors are just about passable, but Alan Cumming, Antonio Banderas, and Carla Gugino all seem to struggle with the material and come off looking very silly as a result. The sci-fi storyline is about an army of robot kids but never really goes anywhere, instead churning out the usual cliches over and over again. Genuine actors like Danny Trejo and Robert Patrick are wasted in their parts. I can only hope it gets better from here on in.

One of the few pieces of media that has a realistic relationship between siblings, HISPANIC siblings I might add. Seeing a latina older sister save her parents and the world was the representation my young self needed. Every girl deserves to be represented by someone like Carmen Cortez.Also, Gregorio and Ingrid are the original enemies to lovers and powercouple, change my mind.

"Spy Kids" is a Robert Rodriguez-directed film about two kids who find out that their parents are international spies, and that they've been kidnapped, so now they have to save them by using their parents' technology and spy-gear. This isn't too bad, actually. It's certainly a departure for Robert Rodriguez, a man known for the "El Mariachi" trilogy, "From Dusk Till Dawn" and "The Faculty." It's certainly not his greatest effort, but it's still good nonetheless, and it's certainly better than some family movies that I've seen. It actually had some stub - spome spaplala - "substance." (Thank you for reading me this far, I was saying it just like that while I was writing.) So, all in all, I recommend it, it's a great movie to watch with the whole family. And, it's a good way to introduce your kids to Robert Rodriguez, whom they might really get to know with "El Mariachi," "From Dusk Till Dawn," and "Sin City."

Robert Rodriguez just plain out sucked in making this film. It's a complete moron kind of film with no point at all. Who would make a piece of trash movie with just no point in it? I blame Robert on making this, it was just a sucky movie. I think he needs to do action films instead. Also why do kids save the day. That girl is weird and her little brother is annoying and how could he save the day, he's stupid! They should've died and also what is with the thumbs? I had no idea what was going on in it. I got one more question and then I'm done. How can this get a 6.3 rating. It should be in the bottom 100. The only good thing I'd say about this movie is that they have alright inventions but that's it.2/10

Robert Rodriguez is not the first person you'd suggest to make a children's film. As entertaining as 'Desperado', 'The Faculty' and 'From Dusk Till dawn' are, you wouldn't line them up alongside 'Toy Story 2' and 'The Jungle Book' for good, old-fashioned family entertainment. Yet, as this energetic, light-hearted Bondesque spoof proves, Rodriguez has the talent to turn his hand to just about anything, and inject it with the suspense and adrenalin that are his trademark.From the gloriously OTT opening scene (which tells the story of how two agents sent to kill each other fall in love and settle down) to the last second, 'Spy Kids' doesn't miss a trick. The obligatory gizmos, mad villains and dastardly plot to take over the world are all there, along with a star cast all playing their roles with tongues firmly in cheek. The action/humour mix is extremely well-balanced too, with some hilarious visual gags sitting within a sharp script and Banderas, in particular, revels taking a sly swipe at his normal 'strong yet silent Latino' image. Yet, refreshingly for a children's film, it's never patronising, never obvious, and genuinely original in places (soldiers made of thumbs, secret agents transformed into tellytubby-type TV characters - imagine Goldeneye-meets-Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory-meets-Any Tim Burton film and you'll be close). In truth, some of the surreal moments and the more graphic effects may get a little too much for younger kids at times, but these moments are few and far between. Ok, it's a 'U' certificate and you may well have to sit through the trailer for 'See Spot Run', but don't let that put you off. This is one of the better films you'll see this year, and the best out over Easter by quite a way. Go and have some fun.8/10

This film takes a child's cartoonish idea of a spy and runs with it, leaning into a charming campiness that brought joy to my heart. As an adult watching this film, I am impressed by the directing in this film: great performances and expressive, well thought out camera-work. This, combined with excessively creative production design (which clearly had passionate people behind it) creates a world that, frankly, feels like it was genuinely thought up by a children, albeit a team of extremely creative and funny ones with an impressive understanding of filmmaking.
I generally judge children's films for how well i can enjoy them, as an adult, since any film that has to pander to a child mind to succeed is lacking an essential intellectual, critically examinable element. This film half succeeds at that, while also clearly and specifically pandering to children. It's like a live-action kid's cartoon, and the director/cinematographer did a great job at achieving that specific aesthetic.I often struggle when evaluating children's movies, because I am not a child. But the sheer creativity of this film, and how competently made it is in every department-art design, cinematography, directing, writing, score, everything-makes Spy Kids, undeniably, a work of art.

Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez are ex-spies who were at the top of their game until they met, married and decided to retire for their own mutual safety. Years later they have normal lives and have children who know nothing of any of this. When Gregorio learns of former colleagues vanishing, he looks into it, only for him and Ingrid to be captured by the evil Floop, whose children's television puppets are really mutants developed as part of building a private army for Lisp. With their parents gone and the alarm raised, Carmen and Juni learn the truth and are suddenly faced with having to rescue their parents.You shouldn't come to this movie expecting it to be serious or logical because it really isn't. Instead it is silly, goofy and really very daft but still quite good fun for slightly older children and also for adults. The plot is pretty much summed up by the title insofar as you really need to know what is going on because it doesn't make much sense. The film is really about the kids becoming spies and playing with gadgets etc on their way to becoming heroes of a sort. It never takes itself too seriously and it draws humour from this approach well, making it easy to relax and watch because, yes it's silly, but at least it knows it is silly. The Floop creations are too silly to appeal to adults but will probably provide some laughs for kids but generally the film gets the tone right for both groups.Rodriguez directs with his usual approach and I quite enjoyed the effect it had here because it does suit the silly, hyper material (which he also wrote). The effects are mainly good and it should work for most kids in the way that older boys like their gadgets and fantasy video games. The cast did it for me as well, featuring as it did a lot of people who've worked with Rodriguez before. Banderas and Gugino are both sexy and cool in the parental roles but it is Vega and Sabara who lead the film. Neither of them are typically "cute kids" and it helped me enjoy the film for them to be quite natural and buy into the material. Support is surprisingly classy and most of them work. I didn't like Cumming at all but that was more to do with his character; Shalhoub was OK, Hatcher was fun, Cheech pops up briefly, Patrick has a small role, Trejo is ever reliable and George Clooney puts in a small but amusing appearance.Overall this is not a great film because it all nonsense but then, as a kids' film, it doesn't matter so much. The energy, pace and sense of fun covers up for the daft central plot and nobody seems to be taking it seriously. Surprisingly fun to watch, even for adults and worth a look.

"Spy Kids" was a big kids hit! I thought it was pretty cool that there are these two kids Carmen and Juni Cortez who have to save their parents from danger. But I think it could have been better. I didn't really like how they showed how Carmen and Juni's parents got married because seriously, lets get on with the movie!!! But I LOVED the cast. Alexa Vega, i thought was the best one in the cast! She is a great teenage actress and should go really far in the Hollywood movie making business. Daryl Sabara was so cute playing Juni and should go far as well. There was Also Antonio Banderas, and it was an okay movie, not the best, but i expected better.

"Pequenos espi√µes" Um jovem cl√°ssico com a cara do Robert Rodrigues, mas para o publico juvenil, o despretensioso longa que ganhou o mundo com sua simplicidade e carisma, com um toque trash e infantil "Pequenos espi√µes" √© uma grande s√°tira, com √≥timos personagens, grandes atores e muitas referencias. Com um roteiro simples, e uma boa introdu√ß√£o aos personagens, Robert nos coloca no mundo da OSS e tudo que o cerca e logo depois nos faz embarcar em uma aventura, infantil √© verdade, mas ao mesmo tempo macabra, com experimentos humanos, tortura, c√°rcere privado, escravid√£o, mensagens subliminares....Algumas crian√ßas podem se assustar, mas tudo isso tem uma pegada bem leve e de segundo plano, depois vem uma boa aventura juvenil com toques de a√ß√£o, comedia e suspense. Ant√¥nio Bandeiras est√° √≥timo no filme, Alexa e Daryl fazem uma √≥tima dupla, passam um ar de irmandade verdadeira. O filme conta com um estilo de dire√ß√£o bem Robert Rodrigues, exagerado mas divertido, pesado e leve, muitos o odeiam, mas eu adoro seus filmes e o ar de amadorismo perverso e sarc√°stico que eles passam, al√©m de diversas referencias ao cinema e ao pr√≥prio mundo cinematogr√°fico de Robert Rodrigues. "Pequenos espi√µes" tem seu valor cinematogr√°fico, al√©m de divertir uma gera√ß√£o de adultos e crian√ßas, com sua simplicidade e carisma.

'Spy Kids' uses hi-tech means and a busy action adventure to offer an old-fashioned, conservative, pro-family message.  it goes beyond the usual 'family is a sacred and inviolable unit' platitude, and suggests that families have to be worked at, that it's a daily, often violent, even traumatic struggle where nothing can be taken for granted, where enemies and chaos intrude at every corner.Rodriguez seems to parody this message with a sub-plot about a docile army of 'Village of the Damned' robot kids who do the bidding of their master, appropriately a children's TV host, whether for good or evil.  But the essential message doesn't seem to be parodied - the narrative concerns all those favourites in the pro-family genre: the father who has to prove himself worthy of his kids; the kids who have to come out of their shells; the realisation that lies and assumed roles are probably not very healthy in a family context; children should follow in the footsteps of their parents, asserting tradition; children's TV is not a good substitute for family contact and communication.From the beginning, the spy antics are conceived as an allegory for family values - the parents' marriage is conceived and disrupted by their careers in espionage; the main narrative concerns the kids' attempts to rescue their parents and restore the home; the denouement is the scene for a family reunion.  There is even a juvenile Oedipal story, where the son manages to surpass a father he was always embarrassed by.There's nothing inherently wrong with this.  Rodriguez wrote, directed and produced the film, so we may assume it's a theme close to his heart.  For all its CGI modernity, the film's movement actually resembles those old live action Disney films about kids-in-peril (e.g. 'In search of castaways'), crossed with the old-fashioned, fetishised gadgetry and outre sets of Supermarionation; spliced, of course, with the more late-20th century likes of 'Star Wars', 'The Matrix', 'Mission Impossible 2' etc., and, hearteningly, the queasy colour schemes and various plot points from 'The City of Lost Children', which might be this film's dark double.As in 'The Matrix', there are some pop-metaphysical pretensions, such as the scene where our heroes fight their evil doppelgangers, but this is part of the conservative message: the rupture of the family unit entails a breakdown in identity (see also the transformation of dad into a grotesque puppet thing).In any event, we are free to ignore the message, and enjoy the film's surface (certainly, Rodriguez could argue that his message is explicitely framed as a fantasy, a bedtime story, unrealisable in the real world; that would make the tone sarcastic and in bad faith).  This is underwhelming.Too often the bold flourishes betray their CGI joins, and become the digital equivalent of those back projections in Hitchcock movies. Rodriguez admirably wants to create a world of pure 60s bubblegum artifice, but the fact of 'real' actors force logistical compromises that aren't always pretty.This leaves the story.  The script and characters are too thin, and the action too abrupt, for us to engage in their trauma.  Like the usual Rodriguez film, the narrative is pretty much non-stop action, but because this is a kid's movie, the sanitised, cartoon action prohibits the usual Rodriguez tension between the ugliness of the violence and the beauty of its choreography.  The sets are strange, colourful, but somehow lack inventive vividness.  A Tim Burton would have accessed the story's dark centre; Rodriguez, however, provides an interesting subtext about the lingering racism suffered by the Hispanic children at their WASP school as the basis for their unhappiness.

Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid Cortez (Carla Gugino) are the greatest spies who retire to be simple consultants once they started a family. Their children Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) think their parents are boring. Gregorio is annoyed by the children's TV show "Floop's Fooglies" and investigates its host Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming). He turns out to be a villain evil inventor. His latest evil invention with Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub) are kid robots. However the robots have no brains and Floop is after the Third Brain. He's been kidnapping OSS agents and captures the Cortezes. Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin) reveals himself not to be the kids' uncle. He tells them the truth and sends them to the safe house. OSS agent Ms. Gradenko (Teri Hatcher) arrives but she turns out to be a double agent. The robots take the Third Brain and the kids seek out Machete (Danny Trejo) for help who turns out to be their father's older brother.Director Robert Rodriguez has infused this kids' movie with wacky visuals and crazy gadgets. It's all outlandish fun. The adult actors are all top shelf with many Rodriguez alumni. The trick of this movie are the kids. They're likable enough. Their characters are combative siblings but Rodriguez makes sure that they show their love for each other every once in awhile.

I saw the ads and thought SPY KIDS looked awful.  Saw the stills, thought they looked awful (just posing the kids defensively in front of the parents, all in a fighting stance, implies incredible irresponsibility).  I kept reading these wonderful reviews about what a delightful confection this is, and eventually I got suckered in, thinking I didn't want to miss another BABE or something, and the film was probably being poorly marketed to get the kiddies.Well, kiddies might have a good time (though in the theater I attended, restless kids had to be told repeatedly to hush, and one child articulated in the aftermath, "I was hoping for more action").

That's probably why the kids got so shifty during the screening and parents got testy; the kids saw that this emperor had no clothes -- or, more to the point, a candy colored but rather dull one-piece.  5/10

I watched the first one finally, and have to say that despite the cheesy story plot at times, it wasn't that bad. Some kids find out they are spies and end up having to save their parents from some evil dude. The technology and gadgets are very impressive and funny. I liked the age the kids were, not too old (teenager) but not too young to not be, I guess, easy to relate too.I did find the conclusion a bit cheesy and the characters were at times a little over done, but the special effects and everything was done quite well.I rate this 7/10.

Spy kids was very odd. I mean I like wierd and funny odd movies, but this was just to much.  It was so wierd it became stupid.  One reason was that is had WAY to many gadgets. Yes, I know it was in the future but they have to draw the line somewhere.  One other thing is that the bad guys were just so..... so .... I dont know I cant find the right word for how dumb they were.  I thought of it as little kids movies and what Ive heard about the 3rd one is that it is even more horrible than the first.  And I still dont see how people voted a 7 for it.  I recommend not even wasting your money on this.-famo14

Yeah I get the CGI is pretty dated and it's very silly, but look at the movie as it is. People on imdb have a bad habit of giving movies they think are overrated 1s, or movies they think are underrated 10s. This movie is an example of the former.The kid actors are good, as well as the adults. Danny Trejo is a standout for me. Antonio banderas was great as well.The villain, Floop, may be silly but you understand his character, which is something MANY spy movies fail at.Jokes do fall flat, but some do land and are pretty good. The plot is simple and silly and does makes no sense at times, but it's a kid movie: I don't know why some reviewers were expecting an in-depth socio-political commentary on the government and spies. And in my opinion, the plot is entertaining and that's what matters.I suppose that what movies should be aiming for: entertainment. Obviously a good movie needs good plot; score; direction; writing; cinematography and acting (all of which this movie has), but what makes me actually care about the movie is the question of 'if I enjoyed the movie'And I enjoyed the movie, a lot

Carmen and Juni Cortez' parents keep an amazing secret from them - before their kids were born they used to be top international spies. When they are kidnapped by the villainous Floop and Minion, who are building a robot army of copies of world leaders' children, the two kids must learn lots of spy stuff fast so they can rescue them. Along the way they enlist the help of their estranged Uncle Machete, escape from the double-agent Miss Gradenko and confront evil robot versions of themselves.This is a wonderful action-packed comedy spy movie which rattles along non-stop and is packed full of funny characters and Rodriguez' tremendous visual style. It somehow manages to romanticise spy movies and cheerfully send them up at the same time, and there are many terrific action/effects scenes (the kids' escape in a mini-submarine, the jetpack chase scene, a helicopter ride). The terrific cast give it their all - I particularly like Gugino, Trejo and Patrick, but everyone is great and Vega and Sabara hit just the right notes as the kids. They are kinda cute, but they argue good-naturedly; Vega has a great long-suffering quality and Sabara is just plain irresistible as the put-upon Juni, who not only has to save the world but get rid of his warts too. The movie is zippily shot by Guillermo Navarro (who has a walk-on as a minister), has some great music by Danny Elfman and features some cool special effects makeup by the Kurtzman/Nicotero/Berger group. Rodriguez made this movie as a labour of love for his children and it shows in every frame - it's just so much fun, and has a great underlying theme of families looking out for each other in the face of crises. He wrote, directed, edited and co-produced the picture, and also co-wrote the music and co-supervised the effects. This is a great director and a man who makes movies to entertain.

Of all the kids movies I have seen over the years this was probably the worst.  I took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it.The script seemed to be based on a Willy Wonka style story but it just didn't have anything to it.If you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time, it is bad.They are making a sequel, so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie, but I don't think it is possible.

I took my two boys (7 and 10) to see Spy kids today. They were transfixed and wanted to watch it again straightaway. Both are big James Bond fans but some of the content and dialogue of the Bond movies isn't suitable. Spy Kids fits the bill exactly for anyone under 13 who likes the Bond films. It came over to me as a blend of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets Home Alone meets Bond. It was at the kids level without patronizing them and was believable enough for adults to enjoy too. All of the acting was high quality and the special effects first class.I shall enjoy it again in the future on video but it deserves to be seen on the big screen first. Another bonus were the trailers for Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. I often come away from Cinema trips with the kids feeling that we haven't really had our moneys worth, but not today!

this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever. i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie. the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make little like it which made it even stupider. even some of the names were unrealistic. the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made. i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie. the most upsetting one was Danny Trejo a horror movie actor who is always dirty. the other actors were pretty much clean as far as i'm concerned.

Juni and Carmen Cortez are kids whose parents have one secret: they are spies working for the O.S.S. However, the two adults are forced out of retirement after fellow spies are reported to have disappeared, with the father, Gregorio, thinking the spies are mutated into the character of Juni's favorite show, Floop's Fooglies. However, when the two end up getting captured themselves, it's up to Juni and Carmen, who learn of their past from Felix, a man posing as their uncle, to save them, if they can stop arguing with each other to work together.This is a great family film. The action is well choreographed, the actors all do a good job, and the story is nice. But the real good thing here is the special effects. The only problem is Carmen and Juni's bickering can be a bit annoying.

I couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a total drag. Childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes "Legally blonde" look like "The Usual Suspects" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. Well if I were 12, I'd feel insulted. The best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing Carla Gugino that just stole every scene she was in. Sadly, there weren't many. 4/10

For a film aimed primarily at children under twelve, 'Spy Kids' is surprisingly amusing enough with plenty of action and comedy to keep both kids and adults happy. The film is the first in a long line to use the idea of child spies as the plot device with the story itself centring on twelve-year-old Carmen and her eight-year-old brother Juni as they strive to rescue their spy parents from the grasps of Floop, a campy TV presenter with dreams of world domination.There are, of course, an abundance of special effects in the film that are of a decent quality and a number of intriguing James Bond-like gadgets make their appearance. However, what makes this film engaging is the interesting story that walks a neat line between being moralistic without preaching (we have the typical sibling fights but they band together in tough times as well as topics such a trust and familial loyalty being touched on) and not taking itself seriously (the adult characters are there mainly as comic relief back-up to the child leads and they revel in this role). Also, the child actors, Alexa Vega as Carmen and Daryl Sabara, show they are talented enough to carry off the bulk of the film themselves with limited support from Antonio Benderas and Carla Gugino, who play their screen parents.Unlike the lukewarm sequels, 'Spy Kids' is the kind of children's flick that older family members won't mind watching since the funny and action-packed plot and appealing performances by all the actors involved provide fun for a wide age range. In fact, the only problem I have with this film is that we can predict many mediocre copy-cat films, using the child spy concept, to be produced for the next five or six years until another fresh idea comes along, ripe for the rip-off.

SPY KIDS is a film franchise that I never had any experience of before now. I've just watched the first film for the first time some seventeen years after it was released, and I'm afraid I didn't enjoy the experience. This is a silly, dumbed-down children's film featuring over the top performances from the adult actors and a whole variety of shoddy CGI effects work which looks extremely fake when witnessed in the modern day. The child actors are just about passable, but Alan Cumming, Antonio Banderas, and Carla Gugino all seem to struggle with the material and come off looking very silly as a result. The sci-fi storyline is about an army of robot kids but never really goes anywhere, instead churning out the usual cliches over and over again. Genuine actors like Danny Trejo and Robert Patrick are wasted in their parts. I can only hope it gets better from here on in.

"Spy Kids" is a Robert Rodriguez-directed film about two kids who find out that their parents are international spies, and that they've been kidnapped, so now they have to save them by using their parents' technology and spy-gear. This isn't too bad, actually. It's certainly a departure for Robert Rodriguez, a man known for the "El Mariachi" trilogy, "From Dusk Till Dawn" and "The Faculty." It's certainly not his greatest effort, but it's still good nonetheless, and it's certainly better than some family movies that I've seen. It actually had some stub - spome spaplala - "substance." (Thank you for reading me this far, I was saying it just like that while I was writing.) So, all in all, I recommend it, it's a great movie to watch with the whole family. And, it's a good way to introduce your kids to Robert Rodriguez, whom they might really get to know with "El Mariachi," "From Dusk Till Dawn," and "Sin City."

Robert Rodriguez just plain out sucked in making this film. It's a complete moron kind of film with no point at all. Who would make a piece of trash movie with just no point in it? I blame Robert on making this, it was just a sucky movie. I think he needs to do action films instead. Also why do kids save the day. That girl is weird and her little brother is annoying and how could he save the day, he's stupid! They should've died and also what is with the thumbs? I had no idea what was going on in it. I got one more question and then I'm done. How can this get a 6.3 rating. It should be in the bottom 100. The only good thing I'd say about this movie is that they have alright inventions but that's it.2/10

One of the few pieces of media that has a realistic relationship between siblings, HISPANIC siblings I might add. Seeing a latina older sister save her parents and the world was the representation my young self needed. Every girl deserves to be represented by someone like Carmen Cortez.Also, Gregorio and Ingrid are the original enemies to lovers and powercouple, change my mind.

This film like the other two were a big part of my childhood so revisiting them for me is quite the nostalgia trip.While compared to today's films this is extremely corny, old, and dated but nonetheless it's a fun film if you can turn your brain off to certain cringe worthy moments. Also the nostalgia definitely helps keep the score up a bit.IMDb: 7/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Watched on HBO Max.

I loved this film as a kid and wanted to go back and watch it again to spot all the moments I enjoyed first time around.I think all these years later the film still holds up as a bitter than average family film. I don't think the director needed to stretch it out to be a trilogy (or add the very poor fourth entry many years later)but that's another matter.The two lead kids play the parts well and have a good dynamic between them and Antonio Banderas/Carla Gugino are good support as the parents.Watching it back now though I think it does have some slow parts and the technology looks a bit dated compared to what we're used to today, but Spy Kids 1 still remains a quality film for all the family.
