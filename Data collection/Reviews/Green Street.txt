This was my favorite movie back in my teens, I still love it and I always will but I do acknowledge it's not perfect. The acting is sometimes way over the top and Charlie Hunnam's London accent is worse than mine and I'm not even a native speaker. The story is simple yet appealing, it's easy to get invested into it. The unlikely event that an American Harvard student moves to London and becoming a football/soccer hooligan is oddly appealing and it made me curious as to what's gonna happen next. I was not completely sold on the drama elements but what this movie lacks in complexity it makes up for in entertainment value. When I saw this for the first time I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie.If you looking for popcorn entertainment this is the movie for you.If you looking for a deep story that will stick with you, you may wanna look elsewhere.

5 Stars; A truly great film, with a powerful story. Beautifully photographed, in London, Wow! The audience was quickly involved, and laughed, started, and gave a standing ovation at the end. Truly a complete film, thank you for having a real ending to the film, which is so rare these days. Never apologize for this film, it is loving, stark, caring, hard, honest, violent, and beautiful. It touches the emotions, and the feeling of not belonging that exists within many of us, and that longing for love and brotherhood, that is not available without some dire costs. The characters were so clearly human, powerful and conflicted one was drawn to care for everything that happened to them and cheer at their triumphs and sit in horror at their losses.I have recommended that everyone see this film during SXSW. My wife and I were expecting an audience award for the film, which it easily won, however the Jury Award was also won and we were give true appreciation for the jury system at SXSW.Beautiful photographed, with outstanding music, this production hits all the marks out of the ballpark and should be studied for how powerful film today could be. This is the level of film making I aspire to achieve.

I'm an American.. huge football fan.. and lived in London for some time. I was really excited to see this movie, but left somewhat disappointed.It was strong and compelling.. and the acting was great.. particularly Charlie Hunnam. The fight scenes, while clearly disturbing, did not bother me so much. I also thought it was very interesting to learn about the organization of "the firms," etc. I had no idea such a thing existed. I always thought of Hooliganism as a bunch of young drunken idiots, who like to pick fights, etc. Boy was I wrong.However, the one underlying thing that troubled me was.. Elijah Wood's character just didn't fit in. VERY MINOR SOILER ALERT - A kid who was afraid of his weasel roommate at preppy Harvard ... is all of the sudden mixing it up with hard core British Hooligans, huh? I felt like if the storyline was accurate, Matt would have split the money with Pete right off the bat.. and would have been at the nearest Starbucks six minutes later. End of movie. I kept going back to that in my mind.Overall though, it certainly was a good movie.. worth seeing.

I saw this at a mystery preview screening where I didn't know what film was going to be shown. Sometimes these previews turn out to be real turkeys but thankfully that wasn't the case this time.Without revealing too much of the story, Elijah Wood's character gets kicked out of Harvard for a drug offence he didn't commit. He flies to London to visit his sister and quickly gets caught up in a small group of West Ham United supporting hooligans called the Green Street Elite.The film does slightly glamorise the violence, but ends on a moralising note. An engaging storyline, good cinematography and decent cast performances make this a very enjoyable film.Two minor demerits: 1) Charlie Hunnam's "cor blimey guv'nor" accent owes more to Dick van Dyke than London's East End.2) To establish that Wood's character has landed in London, we hear this frankly ridiculous message over the airport's PA system - "this is a security announcement at London Heathrow airport". Presumably this was inserted for the hard of thinking.To all the Americans who have commented that they'd avoid British football matches as a result of this film, I point out that this film is fiction - not a documentary. Hooligans are an absolutely tiny minority of the crowd at a football match and even then they invariably only fight among themselves rather than randomly attacking innocent members of the public (something the film accurately portrayed).All in all, an excellent film, worth going to see.

In Hooligans (2005), sometimes known as Green Street Hooligans Elijah Woods plays Matt Buckner, an Harvard undergrad who is wrongfully expelled and moves to London where he is thrown right into the deep end: british football hooliganism.Being a fan of english football and british culture I was instantly intrigued by this movie. I'm not all that familiar with Elijah Woods all though I of course know of and admire his work from Lord of the Rings. Being the main character of this story I found his character pretty good and interesting but the best character in this movie is Pete Dunham played by Charlie Hunnam. I like a lot of Hunnams older work and I think he is absolutely brilliant and superb in this role. I also think his character is very good. I think there is a lot of depth to him and in general I just like the actor and the character.When it comes to the plot I definitely think this movie is a movie of two halves. I liked the first half a lot. It had some violence but it never got too dark and it was really comedic however in the second half I think the movie took a downwards turn. The movie got a lot more violent and a lot of darker which I didn't appreciate and I didn't like it.Overall I liked a lot about this movie. It was comedic, exciting and enjoyable but the achilles' heel of Hooligans is its dark and violent second half that really leaves a sour taste in the mouth when the end credits roll.

Saw it at Tribeca and went to every showing! The acting is spot-on, the direction and cinematography are practically flawless. Elijah proves again what a unique talent he has always been. I hope this film is released on this side of the herring pond. It is thoroughly entertaining! I was a little worried about the probability of a clean-cut kid from Harvard being drawn so easily into the lifestyle of football hooliganism for any reason, but it works well. Even though I still think it would have been more convincing if Matt had a background that would indicate a slight interest violent sports, say if he was a kick boxer or push hand enthusiast, for example. Matt's motivation bothered me more than any of the violence depicted. Still, it is an excellent film.

First of all there hasn't been a good film about English Football Hooliganism. Both ID in 1995 and last years FOOTBALL FACTORY either failed to convince or just went down the familiar exploitative road of glamorising the buzz and thrill of violence.HOOLIGANS as the title suggests depicts what these aforementioned films centre upon with the added value of having a story and characters you care about. There's no avoiding the cliché's as the ranks of these organised gang members are portrayed as gangsters.Similar to BBC's Gary Oldman drama THE FIRM broadcast in 1986 it also show the characters as normal members of society, family men with respectable jobs. FOOTBALL FACTORY took the extreme and unconvincing scenario that these weekend animals are florist's during the week which might be amusing but the subject matter of organised territorial football hooliganism needs to be given a serious look at.Fortunately HOOLIGANS portrays this more realistically, sure there's the stereo types in designer clothes (The Chavs) as we call them now where loyalty, respect, revenge, dignity and pride are what they live for, not the enjoyment of the actual sport. This simply acts as the excuse to fight in a traditional gang warfare environment. The prospect of West Ham's cup tie with Millwall brings joy to the faces of both sets of fans.Casting Elijah Wood is a bold move, he looks like a Choirboy but this adds to the films main storyline of innocence corrupted. The acting is better than average, despite letting his cockney accent slip on occasions, Gang leader Charlie Hunnam shows a genuine mix of anger, aggression and compassion which holds the film together.This won't win awards but it's refreshing to see a film finally tackling the subject matter that unfortunately has been a shameful factor of Britain's attitude towards football as we are constantly under threat of being disqualified from International tournaments due to the bad behaviour of soccer hooligans.

I saw this movie at the Malibu Film Festival in Santa Monica, California earlier this year, and I must say, it was all I had hoped for and more. I had eagerly awaited it's release in the US and was pleased to be able to see it at one the several film festivals at which it won jury and/or audience awards.This is a well put together film. The acting, directing, cinematography, script and score are all perfect to portray the movie's intent. Cast with experienced and truly capable actors, there was nothing lacking in the performances given.The story is about a Harvard university journalist major (Matt, played by Elijah Wood) who is kicked out unfairly and flees to London to be with his sister. Shortly, he becomes engrossed in the world of hooliganism which American audiences learn about through Matt's experience and eyes. He is taken into the "firm" which are a bit like gangs, and experiences a brotherhood he obviously had been craving. One of the firm's members resent a "Yank" being in the group, but most of them take to him well.The GSE firm, of which Matt has become a member, fights with an opposing firm, and much violence and heartache ensues, teaching us the lesson that even though the brotherhood is a magnet for the dispossessed, it is not to be entered into without dire consequences.This is a movie with heart. In fact, I don't believe the violence should prevent anyone from seeing this movie, since it is overall one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and is an emotionally engaging film. It is most likely not a good movie for children under 13 to see though.This movie has just been picked up for limited distribution in the United States. My fondest hope is that American audiences will embrace it, and it will become the hit it deserves to be.Thank you Odd Lot Releasing for taking this movie under your wing! By the way, this movie has been renamed "Green Street Hooligans" in the US and will be called "Green Street" in the UK.

The comparisons to Nick Love's 2004 film The Football Factory are almost obligatory when talking of Green Street, but they are linked only by way of subject matter. The films are wildly different in their approaches and attitudes to football firm violence and gang life. Green Street tells the tale of an absolute outsider making his way into a football firm and gradually infiltrating the group as the ever volatile life of fighting and maiming takes a hold on them, seducing them into a stupor of all things crude and nasty. On the other hand, The Football Factory tells the story of a young man of about equal age to Green Street's lead, but instead documents a very gradual decline; focusing more on the way this lifestyle drags down his conscience and mental well-being as the match-day punch-ups take their toll. In short, I find The Football Factory to be one of the most frightening; most affecting and one of the more interesting British films of the last ten or so years whereas Green Street is a passable tale of a young man caught up in a reprehensible lifestyle and how this affects him for his longer run at life.Green Street is more the processed film, in the sense it requires time to set up a lead and his 'current' lifestyle; introduce the characters they'll be spending the majority of their time with; have them enter this 'new' lifestyle; gradually build them up within that bubble before having it all implode and have everything linked to the demonisation of hooliganism play out – it is the quintessential Amercican fable of rising through the ranks. The Football Factory carried less of a preordained aura, it was a series of quite frightening scenes; situations; interactions and instances in which the lead, played by Danny Dyer, would very gradually reach a level of realisation, most of the time shrugging off these warning signs but unable to shake the question at the very core of that film: "Was it worth it?". Indeed, the intended audience is so far infused with Elijah Wood's lead here that football firms and hooliganism in general needs to be explained to him, in black and white, by someone more experienced with the lifestyle.Green Street's Americanised sensibility is captured in its narrative structure; its more thorough attention to character arc and its somewhat flashy, glitzy aesthetic that it carries throughout, acting rather uncomplimentary with its disgusting subject matter. One is reminded of Alan Clarke's low-budgeted; grimy; scuzzy-looking 1988 effort The Firm which was, granted, made for television but gave the world in which it was set a downtrodden and frightening feel to it through its colour saturation and persistence on having the scenes play out in enclosed terrace streets complete with rock solid brick walls acting as the backdrop plus worn-out public houses in which large groups of men would be shot in close-up format instilling confrontation and claustrophobia.It's said that German born female director Lexi Alexander is to have based the film on a number of real life instances with people of a similar ilk, but most of her characters are given some pretty unreal 'triggers' or prior tragedies to further both character and conflict; some of the characters having undergone specific transitions that render them specific archetypes that exist to aid the progression of the story. Examples include the psychotic firm leader whose son died many years ago as a result of some large scale fighting and the once feared 'general' whose lifestyle changed after he met a nice American woman and settled down. The use of these specific lifestyles and prior tragedies to emote both threat and the sense that something's at stake forces the film to feel a little fabricated, thus, pushing the film away a downtrodden sense that something like The Firm certainly had and The Football Factory effectively carried.Indeed, it is Elijah Wood that plays American Matt Buckner, a guy who was expelled from Harvard university in America when his room-mate was busted for cocaine and he took the fall for it. After this, he consequently arrives in England, during which he meets all sorts of new and interesting people. Buckner's past low-point is established, as is the fact he is pushed around a little too easily in the drug charge and the early scuffle he has with friend and mentor to-be Pete Dunham (Hunnam), one item of which highlights how far he'll come in developing during his time in England with the other of which acting as the 'wrong' which exists to be 'righted'. Alexander captures the bond these men have, these big; well muscled men clutching a hold of each other as they sing and talk dirty in pubs, indeed Matt and Pete's relationship is taken to a point that sees a rival, Pete's former best friend, enter a public house as they share a drink and storm out again in a jealous rage when Matt and Pete's bonding is captured by way of his gaze.I don't think the film enjoys the violence, nor does it invite us to enjoy it; more-so, it is the lead character that enjoys the rush of the violence while the scenes play out around him and this acceptance into a sub-culture occurs. Throughout, we know better than Wood's character; highlighted when Matt's father arrives in town and tells his son they can fight this drug charge together – but Matt isn't interested, and would rather stay in a reprehensible zone than continue a righteous life in higher education. The film's worth seeing; its supported by a number of decent performances, predominantly from Bell and Dunham while Wood does his usual 'caught in the headlights' act. Whilst more forced and fabricated than earlier hooligan studies, Green Street is a decent enough film that documents downfall of some degree and the eventual results of how violence and conflict is seen as something to look forward to.

Jesus, this movie was SO amazing - even from the first row craning my neck! I went to the world premiere, and the cast and crew was there. This was definitely the best movie at the festival (SXSW) - and extremely moving (even if you don't love football as much as I do). Besides having great fight scenes, this movie has an intriguing plot, and a devastating ending. Elijah Wood proves his versatility, although he seems too delicate to be a "hooligan". The filming is exquisite, and very Guy Ritchie-esquire. I can't say enough good things about this film. Extravagant. Charlie Hunnam is definitely the best part of this film - he plays the thug well, but not in a stupid stereotypically way - there's a human side to him as well. Watch the rest of the West Ham firm closely - there are TONS of hilarious lines and expressions in this film that are good BECAUSE they're so subtle. Bovver is also an amazing character, Jesus - just go see it for yourself; then see it at least once again. I would go see this movie 100 more times if I could.*UPDATE*Looks like I'm well on my way to that 100 more times - my sister flew in from Austin and we saw the movie 10 times in two days here in L.A. I have to say - the 13th time was definitely the best!

After seeing this film at the Tribeca film festival, I have to say that Charles Hunnam and Elijah Wood gave outstanding performances in their roles. The movie's focus deals with what are the consequences that come from violence. It is a graphic movie whose message is non-violent. Charles Hunnam I believe gave an exceptional performance, one that will be remembered for a long time to come. Elijah Wood proved his versatility as a great actor , playing the role of a young academic turned street smart gang member whose loyalty goes beyond devotion to his mates. It's a raw movie about male companion ship mixed with trust and bravery all aimed in the wrong directions...I've seen this film only once and desire to see it again... the light hearted moments that were sprinkled in and then the very end's wonderful song "I'm forever blowing bubbles... pretty bubbles in the air..' only adds to the poignant message one carries away with them after viewing this excellent movie. I highly recommend it for 14 years and older...

A middle class American journalism student is caught up in the exciting world of British working class violence. The brits are a bit sceptical that he is man enough but after proving himself in a few brawls he's accepted as a proper geezer.The problem with this film is not that it "glamorizes violence" but that it serves up the 'violent English working class' as a cultural artifact for US consumption. America famously 'has no working class' and US audiences are therefore fascinated by a society where a combative working class is part of the culture, along with the Queen and red telephone boxes. But the version of UK life given here is in fact no more authentic than that found in those other films designed for US export starring Hugh Grant and his floppy fringe (4 Weddings, Notting Hill etc..)

Green Street, as it was called in the UK, or Hooligans is a bad film. The story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in England, has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately.My first main gripe with Hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters. Don't get me wrong, I like Elijah Wood and have a great respect for his work, but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role. The main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal, however he spends much of the film placid and cheery, only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film. This linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans. At no point during the film was I convinced that a) he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b) the 'firm' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold.The other main character is played by Charlie Hunnam. Charlie looks the part, and is fairly convincing as a thug. Unfortunately, being a native of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England, he demonstrates the worst East London accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cock-en-y in Marry Poppins. Details such as this probably will not bother an American audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the UK, but being from the UK it was a problem I couldn't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me. The supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast, especially the role of Bover. The lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that Charlie played. With a film like this, you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible, unfortunately, the casting failed. Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had Sean Hayes (Jack) from Will and Grace playing Michael Corleone's part. You would not be convinced. The story in Hooligan is also full in implausibilities. I am no football Hooligan, but I am a fantatical football fan. I know how cliquey a group of 'regular' football supporters can be, as such it deem it impossible for a non-football fan, who is not a fan of the club in question, is not from the area in question and not even of English nationality to be embraced by a 'firm' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases. My final, and biggest, problem with this film, is the way it portrays football hooligans. I take objection to the film's idea that despite being very violent individuals, hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other. This is complete rubbish. Football hooligans are complete scum. They take football, the national sport of England and use it as an excuse to terrorise, frighten and intimidate people. They only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation. They are not brave or loyal, they are cowardly and evil. If the 'GSE' in this film truly loved their club, West Ham, why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name. Hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to English society. Football hooligans do for the reputation of football what Hitler did to the reputation of Germans. Although this film tries/intends to show the 'gritty' side of football violence. It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport. It does not show the poor innocent by-standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins/lighters/glass into the crowd. It does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows. It does not show the REAL fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to European games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone. If you want to see a good film about football violence, watch the BBC drama 'The Firm'.

This was my favorite movie back in my teens, I still love it and I always will but I do acknowledge it's not perfect. The acting is sometimes way over the top and Charlie Hunnam's London accent is worse than mine and I'm not even a native speaker. The story is simple yet appealing, it's easy to get invested into it. The unlikely event that an American Harvard student moves to London and becoming a football/soccer hooligan is oddly appealing and it made me curious as to what's gonna happen next. I was not completely sold on the drama elements but what this movie lacks in complexity it makes up for in entertainment value. When I saw this for the first time I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie.If you looking for popcorn entertainment this is the movie for you.If you looking for a deep story that will stick with you, you may wanna look elsewhere.

The Harvard's journalism student Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) is expelled from the university two months before his graduation for stashing drugs in his closet in his room. However the cocaine belongs and was hidden by his roommate Jeremy Van Holden (Terence Jay). But the insecure Matt does not accuse Van Holden since he is the son of a powerful politician. Matt travels to London to meet his estranged sister Shannon Dunham (Claire Forlani) that is married with a baby boy with the British Steve Dunham (Marc Warren). Matt explains what happened to her in Harvard and when Steve comes home, he asks Matt to go to the football game with his brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) since he has planned to date Shannon that night. Pete refuses since he is the leader of the GSE (Green Street Elite), a gang of hooligan fans of the West Ham United that usually fight after the matches. However Matt befriends Pete and his friends and fights with them, becoming a confident young man. But soon he has a lesson where the violence of the hooligan gangs leads them."Hooligans" is a surprisingly good film about violence and friendship. Elijah Wood performs an interesting character that changes his personality through his experience with a gang of hooligans. Pete is also intriguing since he is a history and physical education teacher for kids and the leader of a gang. It is good to see the loyalty of most of the characters to each other and how they change their personal lives addicted in fights after the football matches. The tragic conclusion fits well to the behavior of the characters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Hooligans"

This is the best new movie of any genre that I've seen in many months. The film really drew me into its world of neighborhood pubs, football supporters, and the dirt-in-the-cracks reality of London. The violence is believable, realistic, graphic, and frightening. As are the consequences of that violence. This film does not glorify hooliganism, it portrays it honestly. Hooligans doesn't preach about mob mentality, or strength in numbers, rather it gives credit to the strength in the individual that lives up to his commitment to his friends though he may suffer because of it. (That's the best way I could word it without including a spoiler.)

It has been interesting reading the comments here. It might be helpful to some, particularly our American and Canadian cousins, to have a little background information on the West Ham following over the years.For some years (approx. 1967 - 1985) and before I realised the error of my ways and retired I was an active member of the West Ham mob, which was made up of several different firms from around the East End and parts of Essex. The main ones being the Mile End ('67 to around '74) and the TBF ('70's & '80's). The ICF got going around 1978 and carried through to the '90's. It was more of an umbrella name given to the combined firms who all came together for the away games. The West Ham mob consisted of between 300 to 400 individuals. The ranks would sometimes be swelled by several hundred regular supporters, so called scarfers (non violent). Often, particularly mid week matches up north, there could be significantly less. It would not be unusual to find oneself on a freezing cold terrace for a night game mid winter only 30-40 handed and outnumbered by a hostile opposition 20-1. It made for some hair raising experiences, particularly trying to navigate back to the railway station after the game through some pretty hostile unfamiliar back streets. West Ham always had a reputation for sticking together and never leaving anyone behind. There were some fearless individuals who held the line no matter the odds and the expectation was that everyone would stand with them. You earned respect by not bottling out, even if you were not much of a scrapper and had legs like jelly.Our traditional rivals have always been Millwall. Correctly depicted in the film. This rivalry goes back at least to the 1920's and is steeped in the history of the London Docklands. West Ham also have a particular aversion to Manchester United and Chelsea for differing reasons.Any West Ham supporter who was there will tell you that the most violent clash ever at a football match involving the club, and there have been many over the years, was actually a friendly. A mid week testimonial game against Millwall at the old Den (Millwall's old stadium) in 1972. Fortunately the two clubs play in different leagues and therefore do not play each other much, no doubt to the great relief of the Metropolitan Police.Now to the film, I was expecting I would not enjoy Green Street as I had been disappointed by all the other Hooli films that had gone before. However, despite a questionable story line and some glaring inaccuracies, including the abysmal accent of the lead character played by Charlie Hunnam, I quite liked it. One has to make allowances for the fact that this was fictional and not a documentary. I thought the acting was generally pretty good and the camera work was of a high standard.I am afraid that the Elijah Wood character would not have made it into our firm in my day. He would have been politely pointed in the direction of the scarfers and told to tag along with them, not because he was an American, if he genuinely supported West Ham this would have been good enough for us, no it would have been because he would have been considered a liability and we would have had to assign someone to keep an eye on him.Finally in the real world the GSE would never have been the top firm down at Upton Park. The age range was too narrow and physically they were too light weight compared to some of the real life characters who graced the West Side, the South Bank and the Chicken Run.Irons!!!

5 Stars; A truly great film, with a powerful story. Beautifully photographed, in London, Wow! The audience was quickly involved, and laughed, started, and gave a standing ovation at the end. Truly a complete film, thank you for having a real ending to the film, which is so rare these days. Never apologize for this film, it is loving, stark, caring, hard, honest, violent, and beautiful. It touches the emotions, and the feeling of not belonging that exists within many of us, and that longing for love and brotherhood, that is not available without some dire costs. The characters were so clearly human, powerful and conflicted one was drawn to care for everything that happened to them and cheer at their triumphs and sit in horror at their losses.I have recommended that everyone see this film during SXSW. My wife and I were expecting an audience award for the film, which it easily won, however the Jury Award was also won and we were give true appreciation for the jury system at SXSW.Beautiful photographed, with outstanding music, this production hits all the marks out of the ballpark and should be studied for how powerful film today could be. This is the level of film making I aspire to achieve.

As one of the privileged few who saw the world premiere at SXSW (even badge holders were turned away), Hooligans is sure to be one of the most talked about films of the year.Lexi Alexander, who, according to her Q&A answers at the premiere, grew up amongst the type of men depicted in Hooligans. The choice to use an American as a central character was deliberate, to quickly get into the story and see the lifestyle from an outsider's perspective.As a wrongfully expelled Harvard student, Matt (Elijah Wood) decides to stay with his sister in England, and is reluctantly befriended by his brother in law's brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam). Wood deftly plays the passive introvert ripe for the seduction of group-bonding violence Hunnam's charismatically surly Pete, who introduces him to football (aka soccer) and the 'firms' who are known for their violence against rival teams' fans.Without glorifying the violence, fully realized and likable characters explore how easily someone can be drawn into hooliganism. Instead of using broad strokes, Alexander demonstrates through Matt how even the most unlikely people get caught up in mob mentality and violence, through the bonds of friendship and belonging.With an edgy soundtrack and strong performances, Hooligans leaves a lasting impression.

I'm an American.. huge football fan.. and lived in London for some time. I was really excited to see this movie, but left somewhat disappointed.It was strong and compelling.. and the acting was great.. particularly Charlie Hunnam. The fight scenes, while clearly disturbing, did not bother me so much. I also thought it was very interesting to learn about the organization of "the firms," etc. I had no idea such a thing existed. I always thought of Hooliganism as a bunch of young drunken idiots, who like to pick fights, etc. Boy was I wrong.However, the one underlying thing that troubled me was.. Elijah Wood's character just didn't fit in. VERY MINOR SOILER ALERT - A kid who was afraid of his weasel roommate at preppy Harvard ... is all of the sudden mixing it up with hard core British Hooligans, huh? I felt like if the storyline was accurate, Matt would have split the money with Pete right off the bat.. and would have been at the nearest Starbucks six minutes later. End of movie. I kept going back to that in my mind.Overall though, it certainly was a good movie.. worth seeing.

I saw this at a mystery preview screening where I didn't know what film was going to be shown. Sometimes these previews turn out to be real turkeys but thankfully that wasn't the case this time.Without revealing too much of the story, Elijah Wood's character gets kicked out of Harvard for a drug offence he didn't commit. He flies to London to visit his sister and quickly gets caught up in a small group of West Ham United supporting hooligans called the Green Street Elite.The film does slightly glamorise the violence, but ends on a moralising note. An engaging storyline, good cinematography and decent cast performances make this a very enjoyable film.Two minor demerits: 1) Charlie Hunnam's "cor blimey guv'nor" accent owes more to Dick van Dyke than London's East End.2) To establish that Wood's character has landed in London, we hear this frankly ridiculous message over the airport's PA system - "this is a security announcement at London Heathrow airport". Presumably this was inserted for the hard of thinking.To all the Americans who have commented that they'd avoid British football matches as a result of this film, I point out that this film is fiction - not a documentary. Hooligans are an absolutely tiny minority of the crowd at a football match and even then they invariably only fight among themselves rather than randomly attacking innocent members of the public (something the film accurately portrayed).All in all, an excellent film, worth going to see.

I thought the idea of the movie about an american experiencing football hooliganism was very interesting and it turned out to be a decent movie. The plot was very intriguing throughout and the movie was enjoyable to watch. I thought the action scenes were good and seemed realistic for the most part. The characters were portrayed well and most of the both accents seemed fine, except for Matt's dad whose american accent seemed a bit off.

I saw a screening of Hooligans at the SXSW and I was blown away! What a great film. The cast was excellent. The director was superb! Great action and still very profound! This was a great role for Elijah Wood. A very nice departure from his usual roles. Charlie Hunnum was excellent. And Leo Gregory as Bover was awesome. The action scenes were incredible. I couldn't believe this film was directed by a woman. She really portrayed the lifestyle of soccer hooligans realistically. Such a different view than the press gives. I can't wait to see more films by this director! When is this movie going to come out in theaters so I can recommend it to all of my friends?

In Hooligans (2005), sometimes known as Green Street Hooligans Elijah Woods plays Matt Buckner, an Harvard undergrad who is wrongfully expelled and moves to London where he is thrown right into the deep end: british football hooliganism.Being a fan of english football and british culture I was instantly intrigued by this movie. I'm not all that familiar with Elijah Woods all though I of course know of and admire his work from Lord of the Rings. Being the main character of this story I found his character pretty good and interesting but the best character in this movie is Pete Dunham played by Charlie Hunnam. I like a lot of Hunnams older work and I think he is absolutely brilliant and superb in this role. I also think his character is very good. I think there is a lot of depth to him and in general I just like the actor and the character.When it comes to the plot I definitely think this movie is a movie of two halves. I liked the first half a lot. It had some violence but it never got too dark and it was really comedic however in the second half I think the movie took a downwards turn. The movie got a lot more violent and a lot of darker which I didn't appreciate and I didn't like it.Overall I liked a lot about this movie. It was comedic, exciting and enjoyable but the achilles' heel of Hooligans is its dark and violent second half that really leaves a sour taste in the mouth when the end credits roll.

Saw it at Tribeca and went to every showing! The acting is spot-on, the direction and cinematography are practically flawless. Elijah proves again what a unique talent he has always been. I hope this film is released on this side of the herring pond. It is thoroughly entertaining! I was a little worried about the probability of a clean-cut kid from Harvard being drawn so easily into the lifestyle of football hooliganism for any reason, but it works well. Even though I still think it would have been more convincing if Matt had a background that would indicate a slight interest violent sports, say if he was a kick boxer or push hand enthusiast, for example. Matt's motivation bothered me more than any of the violence depicted. Still, it is an excellent film.

You've seen them on television, and you've read about them in the news. Europe is particularly aware of folks who travel for football games amongst neighboring countries, only to have them create trouble or duke it out with the locals or one another, if the results don't go their way.While 2005 had a look at professional Premiership football with the movie Goal!, it's time the cameras took a look too at the supporters of the game. Not just any plain old armchair supporters, but really passionate ones, who live, breathe and eat football, and bond together to form Firms (i.e. gangs). Similar to mafias, triads, what-have-yous, Firms thrive on reputation. The bigger the stunt, or the fight, the bigger the reputation gets spread. And it's usually (as explained in the movie, though of course, in better light for West Ham United) the better teams having weaker Firms. I'd like that acknowledgment that Arsenal is the better footballing team, but having a terribly weak Firm, while Spurs are poor in both haha! We also learn what irks the Firms most, besides rival Firms.Elijah Wood plays Matt Buckner, a Harvard journalism dropout for a misdemeanor he did not commit. He flies to London to meet up with his sister, and gets introduced to his brother-in-law's brother (duh) Pete Dunham. Pete's the head honcho of the Green Street Elite (GSE), the Firm of West Ham United, and I'd like the beginning of their budding relationship where Pete educates Matt on aspects of football (not soccer, mind you). The pot-shots at UK-US relations are hilarious, as we see Matt get introduced to the other core members of GSE. Of course him being a Yank doesn't endear him to GSE, but they're willing to overlook the point and give the rookie a chance to prove himself since he's brought in by Pete.We only have one football match to watch (ala Goal!), as the rest of the movie focuses on Matt's transformation from wide-eyed newbie, to mean fighting machine. Elijah Wood didn't have much of a difficult job to do, as all he did was to continuously wear that scowl on his face for the second half of the movie. And it actually degenerates into some sort of UK-football version of Fight Club, where members of rival Firms whack the living daylights out of one another to prove their point. Perhaps co-star Charlie Hunnam did a better job as Pete, ringing home his performance as a leader, and a surrogate big brother.The plot, to me, was engaging material, though it came with some predictable subplots like betrayals. It tries to make the point that violence begets violence, but doesn't offer any suggestions otherwise, because fanaticism in football is real and continuing issue that might seem to mar the sport. Some might deem this movie as romanticizing hooliganism, but it tried to balance those attempts by having a major character (pardon the pun) rationalize and play the devil's advocate.I'm not sure why we had to rename this movie locally to "Football Hooligans". I know Green Street Hooligans might make some go Huh? But this is the internet age, where information is at the tip of your fingers, and all you have to do, is just to google it, or go visit IMDb.com (not as if I'm promoting it, but yeah, common sense). It's one thing having movies renamed worldwide (like Danny the Dog aka Unleashed), and another having a fiasco like "The Spy Who Shioked Me".It's an interesting movie, with grand themes about not letting your buddies down, and for standing firm in what you believe in. Though the premise is controversial (brutal gang fights and all), it did seem like you're watching an updated, Caucasian remake of movies like A Better Tomorrow and Prison On Fire. Just remember to keep whatever inert tempers in check after leaving the theater.*CLAP CLAP CLAP* UNITED!!

First some background; I am English and have lived in London all my life. I have been to many games at 'The Den' and most other London club grounds. I am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know just how they act and how they speak. Have to say this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things.a) People just don't talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded about as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He's from up north in Newcastle and I'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him - how are we supposed to take him seriously. Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done 'a bang up job' myself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean how can I be expected to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans. He'd be dead. Simple as that. Honestly (as a Brit) it was hard to watch this film. I'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the UK. It may do a little better in the states because the Americans just wont know (or care) how inaccurate it is. Please my American and foreign friends, don't believe a word of this nonsense. Yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush, and on a vastly smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in London. Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and expect us all not to notice.

First of all there hasn't been a good film about English Football Hooliganism. Both ID in 1995 and last years FOOTBALL FACTORY either failed to convince or just went down the familiar exploitative road of glamorising the buzz and thrill of violence.HOOLIGANS as the title suggests depicts what these aforementioned films centre upon with the added value of having a story and characters you care about. There's no avoiding the cliché's as the ranks of these organised gang members are portrayed as gangsters.Similar to BBC's Gary Oldman drama THE FIRM broadcast in 1986 it also show the characters as normal members of society, family men with respectable jobs. FOOTBALL FACTORY took the extreme and unconvincing scenario that these weekend animals are florist's during the week which might be amusing but the subject matter of organised territorial football hooliganism needs to be given a serious look at.Fortunately HOOLIGANS portrays this more realistically, sure there's the stereo types in designer clothes (The Chavs) as we call them now where loyalty, respect, revenge, dignity and pride are what they live for, not the enjoyment of the actual sport. This simply acts as the excuse to fight in a traditional gang warfare environment. The prospect of West Ham's cup tie with Millwall brings joy to the faces of both sets of fans.Casting Elijah Wood is a bold move, he looks like a Choirboy but this adds to the films main storyline of innocence corrupted. The acting is better than average, despite letting his cockney accent slip on occasions, Gang leader Charlie Hunnam shows a genuine mix of anger, aggression and compassion which holds the film together.This won't win awards but it's refreshing to see a film finally tackling the subject matter that unfortunately has been a shameful factor of Britain's attitude towards football as we are constantly under threat of being disqualified from International tournaments due to the bad behaviour of soccer hooligans.

I saw Hooligans last night at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema (downtown location) in Austin, Texas. This was a great feature length film debut for director Lexi Alexander. You have to like fight films though, because this was not sugar-coated (think Fight Club). Viewers never got much of a break from the violence. Lexi said in Q&A that this is based on some of the *firms/gangs* she was exposed to as a kid, and that it's not make believe--this stuff really goes on. I also learned that Lexi is a martial arts expert/champion (I think she's undefeated?).Charlie Hunnan was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to see him appear in more films. I have to add that Lexi, Charlie, and the other cast members (including Elijah Wood) were extremely friendly in person. Charlie was polite to us and answered our questions about his career even though he was trying to grab a bite to eat...nice guy and a terrific actor!

I saw this movie at the Malibu Film Festival in Santa Monica, California earlier this year, and I must say, it was all I had hoped for and more. I had eagerly awaited it's release in the US and was pleased to be able to see it at one the several film festivals at which it won jury and/or audience awards.This is a well put together film. The acting, directing, cinematography, script and score are all perfect to portray the movie's intent. Cast with experienced and truly capable actors, there was nothing lacking in the performances given.The story is about a Harvard university journalist major (Matt, played by Elijah Wood) who is kicked out unfairly and flees to London to be with his sister. Shortly, he becomes engrossed in the world of hooliganism which American audiences learn about through Matt's experience and eyes. He is taken into the "firm" which are a bit like gangs, and experiences a brotherhood he obviously had been craving. One of the firm's members resent a "Yank" being in the group, but most of them take to him well.The GSE firm, of which Matt has become a member, fights with an opposing firm, and much violence and heartache ensues, teaching us the lesson that even though the brotherhood is a magnet for the dispossessed, it is not to be entered into without dire consequences.This is a movie with heart. In fact, I don't believe the violence should prevent anyone from seeing this movie, since it is overall one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and is an emotionally engaging film. It is most likely not a good movie for children under 13 to see though.This movie has just been picked up for limited distribution in the United States. My fondest hope is that American audiences will embrace it, and it will become the hit it deserves to be.Thank you Odd Lot Releasing for taking this movie under your wing! By the way, this movie has been renamed "Green Street Hooligans" in the US and will be called "Green Street" in the UK.

The comparisons to Nick Love's 2004 film The Football Factory are almost obligatory when talking of Green Street, but they are linked only by way of subject matter. The films are wildly different in their approaches and attitudes to football firm violence and gang life. Green Street tells the tale of an absolute outsider making his way into a football firm and gradually infiltrating the group as the ever volatile life of fighting and maiming takes a hold on them, seducing them into a stupor of all things crude and nasty. On the other hand, The Football Factory tells the story of a young man of about equal age to Green Street's lead, but instead documents a very gradual decline; focusing more on the way this lifestyle drags down his conscience and mental well-being as the match-day punch-ups take their toll. In short, I find The Football Factory to be one of the most frightening; most affecting and one of the more interesting British films of the last ten or so years whereas Green Street is a passable tale of a young man caught up in a reprehensible lifestyle and how this affects him for his longer run at life.Green Street is more the processed film, in the sense it requires time to set up a lead and his 'current' lifestyle; introduce the characters they'll be spending the majority of their time with; have them enter this 'new' lifestyle; gradually build them up within that bubble before having it all implode and have everything linked to the demonisation of hooliganism play out – it is the quintessential Amercican fable of rising through the ranks. The Football Factory carried less of a preordained aura, it was a series of quite frightening scenes; situations; interactions and instances in which the lead, played by Danny Dyer, would very gradually reach a level of realisation, most of the time shrugging off these warning signs but unable to shake the question at the very core of that film: "Was it worth it?". Indeed, the intended audience is so far infused with Elijah Wood's lead here that football firms and hooliganism in general needs to be explained to him, in black and white, by someone more experienced with the lifestyle.Green Street's Americanised sensibility is captured in its narrative structure; its more thorough attention to character arc and its somewhat flashy, glitzy aesthetic that it carries throughout, acting rather uncomplimentary with its disgusting subject matter. One is reminded of Alan Clarke's low-budgeted; grimy; scuzzy-looking 1988 effort The Firm which was, granted, made for television but gave the world in which it was set a downtrodden and frightening feel to it through its colour saturation and persistence on having the scenes play out in enclosed terrace streets complete with rock solid brick walls acting as the backdrop plus worn-out public houses in which large groups of men would be shot in close-up format instilling confrontation and claustrophobia.It's said that German born female director Lexi Alexander is to have based the film on a number of real life instances with people of a similar ilk, but most of her characters are given some pretty unreal 'triggers' or prior tragedies to further both character and conflict; some of the characters having undergone specific transitions that render them specific archetypes that exist to aid the progression of the story. Examples include the psychotic firm leader whose son died many years ago as a result of some large scale fighting and the once feared 'general' whose lifestyle changed after he met a nice American woman and settled down. The use of these specific lifestyles and prior tragedies to emote both threat and the sense that something's at stake forces the film to feel a little fabricated, thus, pushing the film away a downtrodden sense that something like The Firm certainly had and The Football Factory effectively carried.Indeed, it is Elijah Wood that plays American Matt Buckner, a guy who was expelled from Harvard university in America when his room-mate was busted for cocaine and he took the fall for it. After this, he consequently arrives in England, during which he meets all sorts of new and interesting people. Buckner's past low-point is established, as is the fact he is pushed around a little too easily in the drug charge and the early scuffle he has with friend and mentor to-be Pete Dunham (Hunnam), one item of which highlights how far he'll come in developing during his time in England with the other of which acting as the 'wrong' which exists to be 'righted'. Alexander captures the bond these men have, these big; well muscled men clutching a hold of each other as they sing and talk dirty in pubs, indeed Matt and Pete's relationship is taken to a point that sees a rival, Pete's former best friend, enter a public house as they share a drink and storm out again in a jealous rage when Matt and Pete's bonding is captured by way of his gaze.I don't think the film enjoys the violence, nor does it invite us to enjoy it; more-so, it is the lead character that enjoys the rush of the violence while the scenes play out around him and this acceptance into a sub-culture occurs. Throughout, we know better than Wood's character; highlighted when Matt's father arrives in town and tells his son they can fight this drug charge together – but Matt isn't interested, and would rather stay in a reprehensible zone than continue a righteous life in higher education. The film's worth seeing; its supported by a number of decent performances, predominantly from Bell and Dunham while Wood does his usual 'caught in the headlights' act. Whilst more forced and fabricated than earlier hooligan studies, Green Street is a decent enough film that documents downfall of some degree and the eventual results of how violence and conflict is seen as something to look forward to.

Jesus, this movie was SO amazing - even from the first row craning my neck! I went to the world premiere, and the cast and crew was there. This was definitely the best movie at the festival (SXSW) - and extremely moving (even if you don't love football as much as I do). Besides having great fight scenes, this movie has an intriguing plot, and a devastating ending. Elijah Wood proves his versatility, although he seems too delicate to be a "hooligan". The filming is exquisite, and very Guy Ritchie-esquire. I can't say enough good things about this film. Extravagant. Charlie Hunnam is definitely the best part of this film - he plays the thug well, but not in a stupid stereotypically way - there's a human side to him as well. Watch the rest of the West Ham firm closely - there are TONS of hilarious lines and expressions in this film that are good BECAUSE they're so subtle. Bovver is also an amazing character, Jesus - just go see it for yourself; then see it at least once again. I would go see this movie 100 more times if I could.*UPDATE*Looks like I'm well on my way to that 100 more times - my sister flew in from Austin and we saw the movie 10 times in two days here in L.A. I have to say - the 13th time was definitely the best!

Not going into the finer points of the film, I quite liked it, but nothing world-changing.What ruined the whole experience for me was the accent of the Pete character, who looked the part but sounded awful! I'm going to say that again, the accent was absolutely dreadful! According to the info the actor playing him is a Geordie so (although the two accents are very different) presumably he's heard a Londoner speak before. Apparently replicating it was another thing.At times he sounds American, at times he sounds Australian, at times he sounds like an American trying to put on an Australian accent. When I watch him closely I can see him using all his might trying to articulate the words as a West Ham fan might- and fails all the same. If it hadn't ruined the film it would be funny.

After seeing this film at the Tribeca film festival, I have to say that Charles Hunnam and Elijah Wood gave outstanding performances in their roles. The movie's focus deals with what are the consequences that come from violence. It is a graphic movie whose message is non-violent. Charles Hunnam I believe gave an exceptional performance, one that will be remembered for a long time to come. Elijah Wood proved his versatility as a great actor , playing the role of a young academic turned street smart gang member whose loyalty goes beyond devotion to his mates. It's a raw movie about male companion ship mixed with trust and bravery all aimed in the wrong directions...I've seen this film only once and desire to see it again... the light hearted moments that were sprinkled in and then the very end's wonderful song "I'm forever blowing bubbles... pretty bubbles in the air..' only adds to the poignant message one carries away with them after viewing this excellent movie. I highly recommend it for 14 years and older...

Green Street Hooligans (or just Hooligans for short) is a feature that announces a new female director, Lexi Alexander. Like Kathryn Bigelow, she's not a director of romantic comedies or (I hate to use this term but I will) chick-flicks, but someone who understands how to get the same kind of grit and testosterone that any gifted male action director could get from his cast of actors. In this case Alexander's tough skin is fitting: her subject matter are 'soccer hooligans', or more specifically those who form in gangs in pubs and fight out in the streets with other gangs representing respective teams. It's a whole system that is far more aggressive (and 'pissed' aka drunk) than a typical group of sports fans like one would find in the States, but it's not quite as ruthless as a gang like crips and bloods either.The Hooligans of the GSE fight and act like a gang for status, not for profit, and this is the way of things when Matt (Elijah Wood), a Harvard dropout, lands in England and somehow befriends his brother in law's brother Pete (Charles Hunnam). He's taken along to the pub, then to a football/soccer match, and then proves his worth the best way he can: he gets in his first real fight-cum-brawl in the streets with some other soccer hooligans. From then in the film becomes a story of friendship and eventual betrayal from a scorned member of the GSE, who doesn't like Mike from the start and feels taken aback by his best friend Pete's connection to a practical family member.It's also about the way that the male brain works in such situations: Matt is a very smart guy, being from Harvard and all (and sort of hiding a secret as a journalist major - a big no-no in hooligan gangs, being a "Journie" as its called), but he can go into this violent state of being because it's part of a clique, and part of being part of a group where everyone looks out for everyone else - which he doesn't get from his sister (Forlani) or his absentee father. Alexander works best with her cast of characters and actors when they're in the pub and out on the streets, with the camaraderie so easy to just turn on a dime - the intensity is thick always, even in one of those big sing-alongs like with the GSE's "theme song" out in the streets. It also helps that Wood is better than usual and Brit character actors like Hunnam and Geoff Bell impress very much, very much in the mold of a gangster movie (a good one).The only big drawbacks are some unneeded exposition with the narration popping up a few times. Once is too often really, as it doesn't add anything aside from the "I learned this and blah blah" material. And the final brawl, which shot well, is saddled with a cringe-worthy song that kills the energy and features so much melodrama (and an understandably tragic conclusion) that it's just too much. But in general, this is a fine and hard-knocking 'Cockney' flick- watch for that slang- and great if you've never heard of a soccer hooligan and want to take a look. 7.5/10

Speaking as a movie viewer, I love a movie with action, a believable story and some heart. This movie delivers on all counts. It's like Fight Club in the West End of London (without the schizophrenia.) The plot alternates between pulsing sound and bare-knuckle street fighting and real, tangible character development.Elijah Wood delivers a great performance unlike the boyish roles he's had thus far. He really mixes it up in this movie. All of the performances were VERY strong...not really a weak link in the bunch.Speaking as a female filmmaker, I'm SO GLAD to see a woman director and woman producer make a movie that KICKS BUTT! For all who don't think women can make a good action movie...this proves them wrong.I REALLY hope this one gets theatrical release AND distribution. I'd love to see it again on the big screen and own in in my DVD collection.You go, Lexi!!!

A middle class American journalism student is caught up in the exciting world of British working class violence. The brits are a bit sceptical that he is man enough but after proving himself in a few brawls he's accepted as a proper geezer.The problem with this film is not that it "glamorizes violence" but that it serves up the 'violent English working class' as a cultural artifact for US consumption. America famously 'has no working class' and US audiences are therefore fascinated by a society where a combative working class is part of the culture, along with the Queen and red telephone boxes. But the version of UK life given here is in fact no more authentic than that found in those other films designed for US export starring Hugh Grant and his floppy fringe (4 Weddings, Notting Hill etc..)

Green Street, as it was called in the UK, or Hooligans is a bad film. The story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in England, has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately.My first main gripe with Hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters. Don't get me wrong, I like Elijah Wood and have a great respect for his work, but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role. The main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal, however he spends much of the film placid and cheery, only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film. This linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans. At no point during the film was I convinced that a) he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b) the 'firm' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold.The other main character is played by Charlie Hunnam. Charlie looks the part, and is fairly convincing as a thug. Unfortunately, being a native of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England, he demonstrates the worst East London accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cock-en-y in Marry Poppins. Details such as this probably will not bother an American audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the UK, but being from the UK it was a problem I couldn't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me. The supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast, especially the role of Bover. The lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that Charlie played. With a film like this, you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible, unfortunately, the casting failed. Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had Sean Hayes (Jack) from Will and Grace playing Michael Corleone's part. You would not be convinced. The story in Hooligan is also full in implausibilities. I am no football Hooligan, but I am a fantatical football fan. I know how cliquey a group of 'regular' football supporters can be, as such it deem it impossible for a non-football fan, who is not a fan of the club in question, is not from the area in question and not even of English nationality to be embraced by a 'firm' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases. My final, and biggest, problem with this film, is the way it portrays football hooligans. I take objection to the film's idea that despite being very violent individuals, hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other. This is complete rubbish. Football hooligans are complete scum. They take football, the national sport of England and use it as an excuse to terrorise, frighten and intimidate people. They only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation. They are not brave or loyal, they are cowardly and evil. If the 'GSE' in this film truly loved their club, West Ham, why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name. Hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to English society. Football hooligans do for the reputation of football what Hitler did to the reputation of Germans. Although this film tries/intends to show the 'gritty' side of football violence. It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport. It does not show the poor innocent by-standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins/lighters/glass into the crowd. It does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows. It does not show the REAL fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to European games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone. If you want to see a good film about football violence, watch the BBC drama 'The Firm'.
