This is one of my favorite comedies and one of Robin Williams' best performances. I love how Robin Williams plays a woman convincingly without being over the top. This movie shows off a lot of his comedic skills and some of his serious acting chops. Robin Williams will always hold a special place in my heart as one of the greatest actors of all time and one of my biggest acting inspirations. Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan, and the child actors are also really great in this movie. The themes of divorce are handled very well. I wish Robin Williams was still around acting in movies. Rest In Peace, Sir!

Daniel Hillard (the late Robin Williams) is a wacky and unreliable actor. His wife (Sally Fields) gets sick of it after 14 years and decides to divorce him. He's a great father though. To see his kids every day, he cooks up a crazy plan to pose as a female nanny. His gay brother (Harvey Fierstein) helps him with the disguise.His plan works. He immerses into his increasingly elaborate British nanny persona, becoming a more stable and responsible person in the process. He is also able to spy on his ex-wife and her loathsome boyfriend Stu (Pierce Brosnan)and gets to be with his children (who learn the secret). Then, one night, he has to go to a job interview as himself and attend a family dinner as Mrs Doubtfire -- at the same restaurant. Will he be able to pull it off? This was a funny, enjoyable enough family movie, despite the cross dressing theme and often ribald humour. Williams is talented and hilarious, as usual.My partner enjoyed the film; I had a few problems with it. The movie almost didn't work for me. It was too contrived how crappy everything got for Daniel after the divorce. Also, I was simply unable to suspend my disbelief that his wife and kids wouldn't immediately see through the disguise. (I don't know why this didn't bother everyone else.) And after a while, the shtick of him having to change back and forth under pressure became tedious and unrealistic. The costume was too much for this to happen. The movie became too slapsticky. Nice sweet ending though.

I saw this movie at the cinema in 1993 and thought it was fantastic! It has everything you could ever really want in a comedy. Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) will do ANYTHING to see his children! This movie has plenty of gags, but it all comes together in a nice, friendly framework that centres around one man's family and that man's love for his children that'll make him dress up as a 60 year old granny to get back into their lives! Plenty of laughs throughout and all-round great performances. 9/10

As much as I respect Robin Williams as an actor, and I truly admit his performance is impeccable, there's more than simply funny and well-acted comedy in this movie. Lots of things distracted me from enjoying this movie in an easy and relaxed way, making me questioning the moral compass of the protagonist.The message this movie sends is questionable. You can be all sorts of irresponsible, immature, passive-aggressive (active as well), lying, deceiving b*tch, and have a good excuse if you did for *insert 'children' here*. Instead of finding a common ground with a *formerly* loved one, the protagonist chooses to deceive her and then enforce his possessiveness on her (in the episodes with her 'new old boyfriend'). That should make people think it wasn't just one case of birthday party chaos to ignite the fuse of divorce, it speaks a lot about his attitude towards his ex-wife. Relationships between two adults come first in the family, children come next.

"Mrs. Doubtfire" is an extremely funny and heartfelt film. It has tons of laughs as well as tears, this is definitly Robin Williams' best film. Watching williams do voices as well as play Mrs. Doubtfire is a real treat. Also the supporting cast of actors do an excellent job, I highly reccomend it.

Decent enough comedy. Robin Williams is hysterical as always. Howver, this movie can't come close to "Tootsie", I think Dustin Hoffman was so unforgettable in his role that he may have spoiled it for others. Although Williams is certainly funny, the "man as woman" premise will always be associated with Tootsie. That said, this is certainly a funny movie-I'd give it a 7.

When Robin died, it was one of the saddest moments ever. He was a hero to me comedically and the fact that he was suffering from depression was so tragic. This movie is one of his greatest performances, up there with Aladdin. Not a wholly original story but made better by him. A truly fantastic movie that I was happy to rewatch on Disney+

There aren't many good cross-dress comedies out there, that' why when a movie like this comes along, you have to appreciate it, despite whatever level of doubt may apply. Mrs Doubtfire is not the best comedy, and most certainly not the best movie, but it is a very heart-warming story about a father who is crazy about his kids, and when he gets a divorce he is willing to do "anything" to spend the time he needs with his children, including dressing up as a 60 year old woman.There are two major things that make this film an exception. There's Robin William's excellent display of his renowned voicing acting, and the heart-melting theme of the warmth and importance of family. There are so many occasions in this film where in one scene you want to break out in tears, and then in another, crack yourself with laughter. Mrs Doubtfire is one of those movies that you can cuddle up with at any time. The equal complexion of heart and comedy is a wonderfully touching and hilarious experience. It's something for the whole family, definitely worth the watch.

Many people say that "Mrs.Doubtfire" is one of the funniest movies ever made in the U.S. I agree with the above idea for the following two reasons. First,performance of the voice of Robin Williams is very wonderful.For example, he uses a lot of funny ad lib in the stand-in of animation in the first scene. Second, Robin Williams and Sally Field as well as the three children act very delightfully though the movie deals with a rather serious theme---warmth and importance of family. Some people say Sally Field doesn't act well in this movie. But, I think that she acts a role of a wife whom is worried about her husband excelentlly. We feel big love of both father and mother toward children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful family movie.

I was a young girl the first time I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. I was introduced to the movie by my parents. While some of the movies lines are "inappropriate", I still think that the movie is a Important and heartwarming film that every family should watch together. Despite the Films PG-13 rating, I don't really see anything inappropriate about the film. If anything people can watch the film to see the comedic genius that (was) Robin Williams. People can also learn a wonderful message from the form. No family is perfect, and sometimes families won't be together but that doesn't mean that there is no love. Love is sprinkled all throughout this film and that's probably what makes it's withstand the test of time. While Robin Williams is sadly no longer with us, his comedic timing and adlibbing of fantastic one liners will live on forever through Mrs. Doubtfire and so many other wonderful films. I encourage every family to watch this film together, it will touch your life forever.

Let's face it; the premise is hardly believable - but it sure is a lot of fun!!Robin Williams stars as Daniel Hillard, a freelance voice actor who struggles to keep a job. In contrast, his wife Miranda is working for a high profile company and working her way up the ranks. She sees Daniel as a failure. In the midst of their constant fighting, are their children Lydia, Chris and Natalie. After a chaotic birthday party, Miranda files for divorce.Desperate to be with his children, whom he loves more than anything in the world, Daniel decides to transform into Mrs Doubtfire when he learns Miranda is looking for a housekeeper. Robin Williams' transformation into Mrs Doubtfire is one of the best I've seen. The make-up was incredible. Stunning!Robin Williams is sensational as Mrs Doubtfire. The man is (sorry, was) a comedy genius! Harvey Fierstein and Anne Haney delivered wonderful performances in the supporting cast.

I know people liking or disliking a movie is opinion, but I have to completely disagree with the negative reviews. The famous Roger Ebert thought this film wasn't very funny and gave it a thumbs down in his review. It's not as great as Some Like It Hot or Tootsie, but it is still an enjoyable, hilarious family comedy that showcases Robin Williams' talent as a comedic and serious actor. It has good drama and comedy interspersed throughout. It's not my favorite comedy ever, but I still like it, I think it's quite good. Admittedly, I have a bit of nostalgia for this one since I was a kid when I first watched it, but even as an adult, I think the movie still holds up and is touching, heartwarming, and hilarious. I would give this movie a 7.5/10, it's pretty good, but not great.

Just imagine "Good Morning Vietnam" transposed to San Francisco and you've basically got "Mrs. Doubtfire". Out of work and now divorced, Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) comes up with the most whacked-out plan: he dresses up as the elderly British nanny Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire. From there, he's basically free to be as crazy as possible.Obviously, this movie may be overall about the importance of family, but it is a great excuse for Robin Williams to have a series of great lines (I really liked the scene where he was playing with the dinosaurs). With great support from Sally Field as ex-wife Miranda, Pierce Brosnan as her new hubby Stuart Dunmeyer, and Harvey Fierstein as Daniel's hairdresser brother Frank (I'm assuming that his character was gay), this is one movie that you can't afford to miss.

MRS. DOUBTFIRE is easily one of the best movies ever made. Robin Williams makes audiences laugh and cry at his portrayal of a loving father who wants nothing more than to be with his children. After a painful divorce, he tries to gain custody of his children. This is the premise of the film. Along the way, of course, there are plenty of laughs, especially some great moments with Harvey Fierstein as Williams' brother and hair stylist. This film is so moving that it deserves to be seen by everyone.

This is one of my favorite comedies and one of Robin Williams' best performances. I love how Robin Williams plays a woman convincingly without being over the top. This movie shows off a lot of his comedic skills and some of his serious acting chops. Robin Williams will always hold a special place in my heart as one of the greatest actors of all time and one of my biggest acting inspirations. Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan, and the child actors are also really great in this movie. The themes of divorce are handled very well. I wish Robin Williams was still around acting in movies. Rest In Peace, Sir!

Some might think that this film isn't funny. But I dare you to watch it (even though it isn't dangerous). This is one of Robin Williams's best acted films to date and he will probably never be any funnier than here (except in a couple of other films and his stand-up). He plays a free-spirited man who's wife is divorcing him. Since he can't stand being apart from his kids, he devises a plan to become a housekeeper in the house, at any cost (even at Oscar winning makeup to turn him into a English maid with wicked humor). Funny in parts, and those parts are the best. but also with a very deep yet almost hidden message about families. Possibly the funniest film by WIlliams and of 1993.

This movie had a great cast, great casting directors, and won several awards. I thought that the movie was fine, but found that behind the comedy Mrs. Doubtfire is a sad movie. Golden Globe Winner for the part, Robin Williams (Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting) himself  is a very nice person indeed. The Julliard graduate, actor is extremely talented and funny. But with all its funny parts I think that a father having to disguise himself as a woman to see his children is a very sad situation. I recommend the movie, and hopefully you will be able to concentrate on the funny parts of the movie more than I did. My favorite quote: Mrs. Doubtfire": My first day as a woman and I am already having hot flashes." My favorite Scene: When "Daniel Hillard" is finally allowed to see his children by "Miranda Hillard"  Sally Field (Norma Rae).

When Robin Williams died, we lost one of the most creative forces in the history of the entertainment world. He seemed able to latch on to any sort of role and make it his, with that nonstop mind of his. This, of course, has him impersonating a 60 something British nanny who moves in with his own kids in order to be near them. His ex- is Sally Field. Of course, it seems unlikely he would be able to get away with this, but in the context of the movie, he does. What we have from there on are sight gags, close calls, and marvelous improvisation from the master. He also creates an endearing figure that would still pass as a wonderful grandma type in any case. There were times when I forgot Williams was in that costume. There is a delicate touch here that really works. One of the best movies of the year.

As much as I respect Robin Williams as an actor, and I truly admit his performance is impeccable, there's more than simply funny and well-acted comedy in this movie. Lots of things distracted me from enjoying this movie in an easy and relaxed way, making me questioning the moral compass of the protagonist.The message this movie sends is questionable.

Decent enough comedy. Robin Williams is hysterical as always.

Although Williams is certainly funny, the "man as woman" premise will always be associated with Tootsie. That said, this is certainly a funny movie-I'd give it a 7.

For me, this was the funniest movie I ever saw. Not normally a huge fan of comedy, I was just about rolling in the theatre aisles during this gem. Robin Williams is brilliant in his 'dual role' as the rejected husband, Daniel, and the buxom British nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire.This movie tells the story of a bitter separation, when Miranda insists on a divorce from her immature, goofy husband. Daniel, denied custody and given only limited visitation, concocts a female nanny character for himself in order to gain daily access to his three children. The kids grow to love and depend on their unusual but very concerned and efficient new nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire, who really gets the household running extremely smoothly. Of course meanwhile Miranda has a new love interest named Stu.Williams' portrayal of Mrs. Doubtfire is hilarious in every way, shape, and form. The wig, stockings, dress, make up...it's all too amusing, watching Daniel transform for the part. Wait till you see Mrs. Doubtfire cooking! The most insanely funny scene is at a restaurant where Daniel / Mrs. Doubtfire must quickly be in two places at the same time, so he / she is forced to alternate between personae at lightning speed, sometimes forgetting which one he / she is at any given moment. I won't give away the plot, but I nigh expired from laughing.Sally Field charmingly plays Daniel's now separated wife, Miranda, and Pierce Brosnan is suitably unsympathetic as her new love interest, Stu. We cheer for Daniel through his assorted antics as he tries to shoo away this romantic competitor for his ex wife's affections and especially, this new male threatening to usurp his role as father to his kids.Desite being a comedy, this film does on the serious side reveal the devastating effects of divorce on children's lives and also particularly on the noncustodial parent. Daniel is distraught as he misses seeing his kids every day. Furthermore, the entrance of a new love interest naturally adds to the general strife.Where did Mrs. Doubtfire get her unusual name? Does she live on or fizzle out at movie's end? Will Daniel and Miranda get back together, or will Stu prevail? I won't divulge any spoilers, but I guarantee you'll fall in love with this lovable large nanny and wish you could have her babysit your own kids. Mrs. Doubtfire will certainly live on in your heart.

Mrs. Doubtfire is one of those films I used to watch quite often on television growing up. I always enjoyed it as a kid.I'm 22 now, and watched this film again recently, and my feelings have changed slightly. It could be that I've seen a few Robin Williams movies, and he seems to repeat himself a bit too much, maybe not.The main problem I have with the film, is it doesn't really fit well into any category in terms of suitable age viewing. I said I watched this on TV quite a bit, where 1.) It was edited and 2.) my mother was never happy about.The movie is a great family film in a lot of ways. There are plenty of things kids would find pretty funny, has some good messages, etc. However, there's also a lot that really shouldn't be in a kid's movie. Language, sex jokes, etc. none of which are very subtle.If you've ever seen The Cat in the Hat film with Mike Myers, you know what I'm talking about. It's got some stuff that shouldn't have been in there. So Mrs. Doubfire falls in kind of an area that suits really 13 year olds, and that's it. It could have been a better film if they'd worked on that a bit.

When Robin died, it was one of the saddest moments ever. He was a hero to me comedically and the fact that he was suffering from depression was so tragic. This movie is one of his greatest performances, up there with Aladdin. Not a wholly original story but made better by him. A truly fantastic movie that I was happy to rewatch on Disney+

It's something for the whole family, definitely worth the watch.

Other reviewers have delved into the troubling aspects of the movie such as the Robin Williams' character's dysfunctional behaviors and his seemingly sudden success in TV. Both are hard to swallow, but it's a movie and movies don't have to be realistic in every detail. There is one aspect of Mrs. Doubtfire, however, that I find deeply troubling as it demonstrates an inequity that often exists in our society and that should be recognized as detrimental rather than being immortalized in film. We all recall how strict the judge was in curtailing Robin Williams' contact with his children and yet, at the end of the movie when he reunites with them and the kids wonder if it's legal, he tells them to ask their mother and she says she took care of it by talking to the judge. I wanted to throw something at the screen!! How and why could a judge's ruling have been reversed merely because a woman had a conversation with him about her ex-husband's visitation rights?? Neither parent should be in the position to wield that much sway or power with a simple wave of her (or his) hand over whether to grant, restrict, or deny the rights of their children's other parent. (By the way, I'm a father who had custody of his two kids as they grew up and who went out of his way to ensure their mother's ease of access and visitation.) I've seen too many kids and too many families damaged and victimized when one parent or the courts use access as a weapon or bargaining chip. It was happening in 1993 when this movie was made and it's still happening today over 20 years later. It needs to stop!

Many people say that "Mrs.Doubtfire" is one of the funniest movies ever made in the U.S. I agree with the above idea for the following two reasons. First,performance of the voice of Robin Williams is very wonderful.For example, he uses a lot of funny ad lib in the stand-in of animation in the first scene.

We feel big love of both father and mother toward children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful family movie.

Bright, if derivative, farce with Something to Say. What might have been a robust, old-fashioned, star-driven slapstick comedy quickly becomes a picture filtered through the newfound Hollywood sensibilities--meaning it attempts to mix pathos with the laughs. "Mrs. Doubtfire" is swathed in feel-goodness. It has a message deep down, and that's a disappointment. Robin Williams plays a divorced dad trying to earn a living as a voice-over actor but finding his ex-wife (Sally Field) pushing him away. Williams' solution in the 1990s seems to be the same as Dustin Hoffman's in the 1980s: win everyone back while disguised as a woman, a big whirligig of sass and smarts to put everything back on track. As amusing as this is, the plot doesn't have any place to go in the second-half; Mom is dating again, and Dad, incognito as the family's housekeeper, attempts to thwart the romance. It's never made clear if the ex-couple still have feelings for one another. Williams argues with Field with wet eyes and a simpering tone (to tell us he's serious), but she is unmovable with him. It's an automatic downer to see a friendly, appealing actress like Sally Field turned into such a harpy--and not even to advance the plot, she just seems in a perpetual bad mood. The kids aren't annoying, and there are some sweet moments and laughs, but much of "Mrs. Doubtfire" is a combination of syrup and cynicism--not a good match. **1/2 from ****

I was a young girl the first time I saw Mrs. Doubtfire. I was introduced to the movie by my parents. While some of the movies lines are "inappropriate", I still think that the movie is a Important and heartwarming film that every family should watch together.

While Robin Williams is sadly no longer with us, his comedic timing and adlibbing of fantastic one liners will live on forever through Mrs. Doubtfire and so many other wonderful films. I encourage every family to watch this film together, it will touch your life forever.

I know people liking or disliking a movie is opinion, but I have to completely disagree with the negative reviews. The famous Roger Ebert thought this film wasn't very funny and gave it a thumbs down in his review. It's not as great as Some Like It Hot or Tootsie, but it is still an enjoyable, hilarious family comedy that showcases Robin Williams' talent as a comedic and serious actor.

I would give this movie a 7.5/10, it's pretty good, but not great.

Mrs. Doubtfire is a film I watched several times as a child. It was one of those movies dad enjoys to watch with his kids so he just put it on countless times. As a kid this movie never got old. Yesterday upon watching Mrs. Doubtfire again, I can safely say I can still enjoy this film past childhood. Robin William steals the show and the dynamic of him dressed as a 60 year old women with a British accent is actually executed rather well and it is super funny too. This film has heart, the story told is unorthodox but it's truly touching when you think about it. Although this film is funny and really enjoyable, it doesn't quite hit the mark everywhere. Mrs. Doubtfire has heart but it doesn't have compelling enough supporting performances that make you cry, it doesn't have dialogue that twists your stomach over the drama and emotion, it's just a light-hearted, crazy spin on a serious situation. The movie also has it's cliches and convenient moments that are also seemingly present in kids movies that often take me out of the film. All in all, Mrs. Doubfire is enjoyable, it's funny and it does carry heart. I would recommend this movie.

This massive hit gave Robin Williams a very good opportunity to show both his comic and dramatic abilities. He had done both in previous movies, but this was the first one when he did both at the same time.Williams plays Daniel Hillard, a man who loves his children but is not very good at adulting. Sally Field plays his wife, Miranda, who is an interior designer, and who comes home to a wild birthday party that Daniel is throwing for their son, ironically after being fired from yet another job because he is difficult.This causes a blow up argument between Daniel and Miranda, and Miranda asks for a divorce. Daniel only gets Saturday visitation with his kids, and since he has been with his kids every day of their lives, he is dissatisfied. So when Miranda advertises for a housekeeper, Daniel applies dressed as Mrs. Doubtfire , a personable 50 something British matron, and gets the job. The reason he has such a professional costume and makeup job that his own wife and kids don't recognize him? His brother, played by Harvey Fierstein in a brilliant cameo, is a makeup artist for the film industry. How does this all work out? Let's just say that complications ensue.I'm just going to take a tack on this I haven't heard very many people take. Robin Williams is brilliant in this and his character has my complete sympathy except for the fact that he apparently had a habit of quitting jobs over artistic license in an expensive town like San Francisco with three kids to support. Yet I found Field's character of Miranda completely unlikable. Daniel has been what he has been for years, but she waits until her profession puts her side by side with a wealthy handsome ex-flame (Pierce Brosnan) to ask for that seemingly out-of-the-blue divorce, seems thrilled when she gets sole custody in the initial hearing even though she knows what Daniel's kids mean to him, and stays mum when the second hearing goes badly for Daniel although she certainly knew why Daniel did what he did. In other words, like so many women who file for divorce, she just wishes the father would magically disintegrate as long as his child support checks keep coming. Because in Pierce Brosnan's character she has found a bigger better deal.The message today seems pretty obvious - "there are all kinds of families". But believe it or not, while this movie was being filmed, the 1992 presidential campaign was being fought, in part, on the ground of what a real family actually looks like. That and the spelling of the word potato. But I digress.My favorite scene - Daniel is getting ready to leave the house, he and Miranda have separated, and he is saying goodbye to his children. The son blames himself for the separation saying it happened because of his birthday party. Daniel reassures him "you did nothing wrong. This would have happened regardless." Children often blame themselves for their parents' divorce and it is important to reassure them that this is not the case.This is a very good drama and comedy. If you want something the whole family can watch, this still fits the bill 27 years later. It skillfully handles the topic of divorce and its impact on children and parents without getting into "Squid and the Whale" territory. But you may find yourself asking unanswered questions such as, how do Daniel and Miranda afford what is today a five million dollar house in an expensive city like San Francisco AND three kids? Also, why is Daniel's brother working in San Francisco instead of Hollywood?HIghly recommended.

Just imagine "Good Morning Vietnam" transposed to San Francisco and you've basically got "Mrs. Doubtfire". Out of work and now divorced, Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) comes up with the most whacked-out plan: he dresses up as the elderly British nanny Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire. From there, he's basically free to be as crazy as possible.Obviously, this movie may be overall about the importance of family, but it is a great excuse for Robin Williams to have a series of great lines (I really liked the scene where he was playing with the dinosaurs). With great support from Sally Field as ex-wife Miranda, Pierce Brosnan as her new hubby Stuart Dunmeyer, and Harvey Fierstein as Daniel's hairdresser brother Frank (I'm assuming that his character was gay), this is one movie that you can't afford to miss.

MRS. DOUBTFIRE (1993) ***1/2Starring: Robin Williams, Sally Field, Mara Wilson, and Pierce BrosnanDirected by Chris Columbus. Written by Leslie Dixon and Randi Mayem Singer. Running time: 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sexual references and some language) By Blake French:	"Mrs. Doubtfire" is one of the most invigorating, vivid character studies to be produced on the big screen this decade. Most of the characters are strongly executed with decisive dialogue. They are also beautifully written with tainted personalities and uncompromising wit. Chris Columbus has assembled a stellar dramatic comedy with excellent screen writing, giving audiences one of the most punctually artful films I have ever witnessed.	The opening scene is as brilliantly structured as screen writing otherwise comes. It has a middle-aged man named Daniel, whom we learn about as he quits his job as a vocal performer for a children's cartoon after he realizes his employers are immoral. This sequence provides us with a development of the character's inner personality, strong morals and consciences. The audience also leans that he is a silly, easy going person. We soon find out it is these characteristics that propel the movie into the first plot point.	Daniel's wife, Miranda, wishes to divorce him because he is too goofy and immature. We are propelled quickly into the firm second act after the divorce. Before this point, we have witnessed both actions and dialogue reallocating Daniel's love and compassion for his family, especially his children. The film sets up the for following events using Robin Williams character as the plot advancer.	Daniel lusts for time with his children so much, he confidentially disguises himself as a sixty year old woman then applies for a day-care job for his ex-wife--this would allow him to be around his children more often. Miranda falls for it, and the master of disguise gets his opportunity. The film then takes us through a hilarious and emotional journey into the lives of a typical American divorced family.	The internal problem becomes more complex when Daniel's ex wife shows romantic interest in a new boyfriend, underplayed by Pierce Brosnan. The filmmakers could have done more with the Brosnan character. Here, he seems developed with repetition and dialogue. Although his purpose is to accommodate romantic competition, we don't know enough about him to care that much.	"Mrs. Doubtfire" contains some material that fairs as overly blunt and outwardly apprehensive. Although the overall presentation is understandable and relative, I still think the picture could have been better with more careful script writing. Even such, we are able to witness a powerful, touching film with a conclusion that is so settling, you will cry with joy.Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.

RIP Robin, you're so dearly missed.There aren't many who can pull off the things that Robin Williams could. His ability to be so compassionate, brilliant, cutting and hilarious all at the same time are legendary for good reason. Ashamed to say I'd never seen this one before now, I may have caught snippets here and there but never actually watched it. 100% not the movie I thought it was. I was expecting Williams to be doing his best Mary Poppins impression and NOPE! His juggling act with the body suit and the guise of Doubtfire were hilarious through and through. He's absiolutely incredible when he's doing his thing, it's everything else that sort've failed to keep up. The family is kinda blah, the movie is so very much of it's time with some super 90s montage moments. But this was still a great watch.If you, like me, managed to not see this do yourself a favor and correct the error. It's not a perfect film by any means, but it's definitely fun and worth the time. Absolutely recommend it.

This movie requires the most outlandish suspension of disbelief, one that usually lends itself to children's movies, but there are two reasons why I could not recommend it for children: first, because such sloppy storytelling is insulting to their intelligence and cons them into believing that it is acceptable to write that kind of tripe, and second, because it portrays two apparently (and I stress *apparently*) solid people getting a divorce as though it were an acceptable solution with three-half grown children in the mix.And when I talk about suspension of disbelief, I do not mean Daniel's elaborate disguise, which is only slightly out-of-whack.No, what I mean is that we are expected to believe that Daniel and Miranda both genuinely love their children and want the best for them. Yet Daniel does not earnestly strive to force them to do better for themselves until he suits up as Mrs. Doubtfire. Clearly he is capable of being a positive influence, and in some way he must have been even before, since his children seem to love him so much--so what gives? Miranda's behavior toward her husband mirrors that of a woman on tranquilizers, yet she somehow holds a successful career and truly cares for their three children. Was she cheating on her husband? The swiftness with which she warms to the advances of her wily English client suggest so, but the plot and the dialogue--especially her confession to Mrs. Doubtfire--ask us to believe otherwise.Daniel's irresponsibility does not seem to breach that line of shirking his duties to his family. Or perhaps, unconsciously, this movie is a commentary on the refusal of modern fathers to act like men and the unworkability of two-breadwinner houses. Maybe they would have been much better off if he had remained a homemaker. But Miranda wanted it all: a solid, independent, successful career, a beautiful family, AND a powerful, manly husband who could protect and watch over her.But it doesn't really matter, because this movie does not concern itself with the dynamics of their EXTREMELY PETTY divorce. Nor does the conclusion, in spite of its pretensions to the contrary, nourish a belief in forgiveness and redemption. Nobody in this movie behaves honorably--and granted, nobody in real life ever completely does, but it is really sad to think that life necessarily becomes so miserable just because of a few petty flaws.

MRS. DOUBTFIRE is easily one of the best movies ever made. Robin Williams makes audiences laugh and cry at his portrayal of a loving father who wants nothing more than to be with his children. After a painful divorce, he tries to gain custody of his children. This is the premise of the film. Along the way, of course, there are plenty of laughs, especially some great moments with Harvey Fierstein as Williams' brother and hair stylist. This film is so moving that it deserves to be seen by everyone.
