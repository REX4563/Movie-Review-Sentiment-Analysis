8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the "Free World," are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.

I was afraid of this movie. For a long time I feared that one day, Eminem WOULD make a movie - and that movie would suck!!!!Along it came, and you know what? It didn't suck. Man, was I relieved. I have never been able to put a finger on Mr. Mathers' rapping skills, I think his technique is amazing. His rhymes are sharp and intelligent and he always performs them with pure justification. But could he take this to the big screen? He succeeded. In his debut movie he managed to play it real and natural. He had good on screen chemistry with pretty much all the characters, but especially with Brittany Murphy (Uh, gotta love that sex scene... That was hot.)The final battles in the movie, are the absolute climax. If you ever had any doubts about Eminmems talents - one way or the other - you definitely know his worth now!Some might say that it must be easy to play yourself, and it's not a secret that this movie is somewhat autobiographic. But it sure takes guts to put yourself out there like that, well done.So 8/10

Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith (Eminem) is desperate to be a rapper. It's 1995 Detroit. With the support of his friend David 'Future' Porter (Mekhi Phifer), he aims to overcome his personal problems. His mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger) is a drunk. He leaves his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) when she tells him that she's pregnant. He chokes on a head-to-head rap battle. He has no place to go but to move back into his mother's trailer. His mom's boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon) is a jerk. He has a part-time grimy auto parts job and then he meets Alex (Brittany Murphy).Eminem is basically playing himself and he does a good job. He's surrounded by good actors. The sense of the place is the standout of this movie. The Detroit locations have the proper grittiness. The desperation is palpable. The rap battles are exhilarating. The story is relatively standard with nice touches. This is a matter of the perfect story for the perfect lead. He's not really acting as much as being himself.

Rap is not my cup of tea.
But this movie is very well interpreted and perfectly holds water!

Those who are saying `8 Mile' shows a vanilla-ed Eminem may have a point: this movie introduces him to a non-rap audience just as `Wild Style' introduced us to hip-hop.  But those who say Eminem is sanitized here for mall viewing have an odd notion of language.  Perhaps his CD's contain more inflammatory material than is aired in this movie, but what gets said here is most definitely not for any suburban grandmothers who aren't stone deaf.It's surprising - admirable, really - how well Curtis Hansen and his crew keep track of the plot from scene to scene when not much of it seems to matter other than Rabbit's problems with his mother, Stephanie Smith -- Kim Basinger.  Bassinger is a blue ribbon southern white trash trailor park mom. You can't help feeling that with minor tweaking she could be the mother of a Grosse Pointe prep school boy, a lady whose problem was overspending instead of imminent eviction from a stinky trailor.  Bassinger makes trashiness look attractive, just as she made movie star decay attractive when Hansen directed her in `L.A. Confidential' six years ago.  Rabbit's problems with girlfriends aren't significant, though he has two of them, an ex and a new one. Both are delicious but primed for rejection.  Rabbit's closest relationships are with his emcee pal `Future' (played by an utterly charming and huggable Mikhi Pfifer) and his slightly retarded token white homie, Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones).But his closest relationship of all is with himself, as is clear from the first scene, where Eminem is doing rap gestures in the competition shed men's room, looking in the mirror, hearing his music in his head --and this is fine, because it's what a young man has to do:  get on friendly working terms with who he is.  The movie is about his going off to be on his own and give up his rowdy playmates to become a winner, and he walks off by himself in the final scene.  The comparison with Shakespeare's Henry IV isn't out of place.  The Shakespearean parallel was used explicitly for Keanu Reeves' character in `My Own Private Idaho' but the theme is really more central here. Eminem isn't a cold personality like Keanu Reeves in Van Sant's movie. He is close to his mates and they're always touching hands and gently hugging each other.  The hands and the hugs are one of the main images that stay with you after seeing `8 Mile.'Eminem as shown in `8 Mile' isn't totally motivated by his anger at all. His anger is very contained.  He seems able to turn it on and off at will and release it only when he needs it --  to trounce rap competition or throw out his mom's sleazy boyfriend.  It's his ability to control his anger that makes both Rabbit and Eminem winners.Eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen.  Paradoxically he projects a powerful inwardness, so that his turning away from everybody makes his face jump out at us.  His effect is of authenticity, because he doesn't put on a reaction to please the audience or suit the scene, but he is always there, moving with the scene and in fact creating it.`8 Mile' isn't just a vehicle for Eminem.  It's too well made a movie to be that.  But without Eminem `8 Mile' wouldn't exist.  The only importance of the rapping contests emceed by `Future' is that first Rabbit shies away from them, and then he enters them and wins them.  You have to wonder how the rapper/actors feel who are in the movie only to be put down by Eminem.`8 Mile' cannot escape from the limitations of the fictionalized star biopic.  There have been dozens of movies about emerging music stars and their families, their early sponsors, their first big breaks, and so on, many of them with more range and specificity of detail than this one. This movie only takes its hero to the moment when he walks away, having shown that he can be a star.  The whole focus is on his personality, and in particular his stillness.  The most important moments are those when Rabbit/Eminem stands with mike in hand, silent, waiting for inspiration to strike.  Even when he choses not to compete and hands the mike back, this moment is full of power.  In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence, raw potential, to a new level of clarity and confidence.This rapper is good just standing there.

This movie was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised! I wasn't an Eminem fan going into the movie but I'm certainly one now. Seeing how different things are on the 'other side of the tracks' was a big eye opener for me.  I loved the script, the actors, the music - basically I loved everything all the way down to the lighting.  It's got everything for everyone in it! Comedy, drama, action, fighting, guns, drugs, sex, and of course - Bunny Rabbit. I loved the movie. I laughed so hard I cried at times and then I just flat out cried at others. I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone whether they are an Eminem fan or not. Do be careful trying to get into it though. We had to go to four different movie theaters before my 16-year-old friend could get in. They're checking I.D.'s on this one BIG time. Anyway - go see the movie! You'll love it! I swear on my grave it's the best movie that I've seen in a long time!

I think the most impressive thing about 8 Mile is that Eminem isn't a terrible actor. Or maybe he's just playing a character so close to himself that he doesn't have to act. The story is predictable, so there's not a lot of tension while watching it. Also, I found myself wondering why these untelevised, unpublicized rap battles were such a big deal for grown adults. Nevertheless, it's a satisfactory underdog story that I'm glad I finally watched.

"8 Mile" is the new film that features controversial rapper Eminem in his first starring role.  The film itself is loosely based on his life growing up in Detroit.  Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr. a.k.a. "Rabbit", a young man who is struggling to make things better for himself through "battles", which are freestyling rap contests that are usually held at a local nightclub. Rabbit chokes when it is his turn to take the microphone for the first time. His best friend, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the host of these battles and strongly believes Rabbit has potential, but the problem is that Future often makes his decisions before consulting with Rabbit first.  Rabbit's home life is not much better.  He's broke, has no place to live, he's stuck in a dead-end job at a steel mill, and his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) has fooled him into thinking that she is pregnant.  Rabbit's mother (Kim Basinger), is on the verge of being evicted from her home and is slutting around with a man who is about the same age as her son.  Things in Rabbit's life take a turn for the better when he later falls in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring young woman who dreams of becoming a model and moving to New York to start life a new."8 Mile" certainly is a moving and very touching drama.  Eminem proves here that he really can act and in fact may have a future in motion pictures. This does not mean we will be hearing him thanking his producer Paul Rosenberg next year at the Oscars, but we can expect to him to receive a lot of praise for future movie roles.  It's quite obvious that some people will not like "8 Mile", just because of Eminem's controversial history.  The film also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time.  Eminem's hit single "Lose Yourself" really does have a lot emotion put into it.   
Eminem, since he burst onto the music scene in 1999 with his critically-acclaimed/lambasted album "The Slim Shady LP", he has been met with a lot of controversy, as well as praise.  Despite the often humorous content of his songs, there are many dark under tones in them as well.  In my opinion, too much has been made about his lyrics, most of which revolve around topics like homophobia, murder, and his failed relationship with his on/off wife, Kim.  Despite all of this, I think that people have overlooked the fact that he said the only thing that truly matters to him is his daughter, Hailie Jade.  Also, if people believed Eminem really was a homophobic, do you still think he would have agreed to perform "Stan" with Elton John?  As a longtime fan of Eminem and his music, I try not to let such criticisms get to me, but sometimes you just have to say "What the hell?  Are they really necessary?"  I don't think so.  The problem is that people today are just too biased when it comes to people like Eminem.  He's not another Vanilla Ice and "8 Mile" is not an attempt to cash in on his success like "Cool As Ice" was.  I have a list of grievances that people need to realize about Eminem:First of all, do not disrespect this man.  I feel that many of the people who hate Eminem have never actually listened to one of his songs.  In my opinion, they have only listened to small clips that have been played on some discussion about his controversial lyrics.  If you actually listened to some of his songs, you'll realize that he is a very distraught young person with a lot to say.Don't watch "8 Mile" with a predetermined mindset.  People who have already made up their minds about Eminem's talents are less likely to enjoy themselves much more than people who believe in him.  To non-believers, if Eminem really did not have any talent, like so many people seem to think now, how is it that all of his records: "The Slim Shady LP", "The Marshall Mathers LP", "Devils Night" (with group D-12) and "The Eminem Show" together have grossed more than $12 million?  I think that it is a clear sign of TRUE TALENT.Also do you believe had Eminem been black and rapping about such "controversial" subject matter, that he would be famous like he is now?  No, because most likely no one would dare even produce him.  That said, I'm African-American and I don't care that Eminem is white and is rapping about such things.I think that too many people have made his race too big of an issue. Eminem knows that he is white and will be nothing else.  He does not display to us a "thuggish" image that some people think that any rapper should have. Also, he does not rap about the things that some people seem to think is destroying rap music.Eminem does have quite a future in store for him.  I'm sure that we can expect to be seeing a lot more of him later on.

8 Mile tells the story of a white kid on the wrong side of the tracks living in Detroit with a dead end job and a trailer park mom.  Deep inside, he aspires to break free from the chains of the reality of his life through the poetry and passion and rawness of rap; the one place he can possibly gain a feeling of purpose and hear his own voice.  Obviously, it's no big secret that this storyline runs very parallel to that of of Eminem's own roots and his own aspirations.  Where fiction and reality collide is blurred and that works for the picture.  First off, I think Curtis Hanson did a great job rebuilding that world and protecting his novice lead.  He understood the material and I was drawn in to the world that he recreated.  Also, the cinematography widely lends itself towards upping the ante of the picture and making you feel the authenticity of a world and a place where many of us have never traveled nor never will.  As for Eminem himself, at first I found him a little stoic, but given the fact that this guy has never acted before, regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, I thought he did a decent job in front of the camera.  Hanson was wise to protect his lead with awesome supporting work from Mekhi Phifer and pretty much everyone else that portrays his friends and peers in the film.  Eminem obviously was a little green and surrounding him with these actors gave the movie and Eminem's journey more credence.  Brittany Murphy was also very good, but I found her character to be a bit expedient.  She definitely was not used to her full potential and I felt that if they had used her relationship with Rabbit to a larger or deeper extent, it only would have lent more to the film. One of the scenes I was most impressed with was the sex scene between Murphy and Eminem.  Gone were the Hollywood antics of glossing it up or ghetto fabulous and I felt that Hanson captured something that was fascinating, uncomfortable and realistic that I haven't seen in a Hollywood film before. Now for what I feel made this movie not rise to the top...  First off, when Kim Basinger first came on the screen and opened her mouth, I thought the rest of the film was going to be destined for failure.  Not only was she weak in the role, she was grossly miscast.  There are so many actresses in that age range that I find it mind boggling that Basinger was used for something in which she stood out like a fish out of water.  The film also almost lost me in the beginning due to the length of the first scene in the bathroom when Eminem is psyching himself up.  The placement of the scene wasn't a problem but it went on way too long - I would have prepared an edited down version.  If you're watching Robert DeNiro for that long looking in a mirror, yes, it'll probably work, but to put that type of pressure on a first timer with no training, especially since it's shortly followed by Basinger's first scene was a risky move and one that I think they could have found a better choice for.  The other thing that kept this film from being a totally strong film for me was the screenplay itself.  I kept finding myself asking why the hell Scott Silver had some of these extraneous scenes in the story.  There was a good story to be told here and a whole world to be explored by the general public that doesn't know that much of it, and the script and film could have and should have been a good 25 minutes shorter and tighter. Anyway, still an intriguing film.  And interesting insight into a different side of life and I commend Eminem for taking the risk.  It's a lot to bite off and half the country is just dying for a chance to decimate him.  If for nothing else, this film is worth the last 5 minutes.  When he was up there battling, I actually started clapping and cheering out loud in the theater - no matter where he stands as an actor, when he's in his domain, he is fantastic, whether you like what he's saying or not. A 7 out of 10 for a movie that was actually worth spending a budget on. Not perfect, but definitely it's own thing with some good moments.  And when they're good, they're really good.

8 mile is the best movie i have ever seen.
the story of this movie is about Eminem life and what he had done for become what he is now. from when everyone bully him to when everyone respected him and his music 
if you count Eminem is not an actor he done very well as a protagonist.
I recommend this movie because Eminem is one of the best artist in the work and who follow him have to see it for understand what he went through when he was younger.

It's time for a Battle! Directed by Curtis Hanson, the movie is a semi-autobiographical account of Eminem's early years in Detroit, struggling to make ends meet and get his rap career off the ground. The film stars Eminem as Jimmy "B-Rabbit' Smith, whom life isn't going anywhere. He can't seem to get any respect among with his peers after choking in a previous rap battle tournament. The only way, he could show the world, he meets business, is to sign up for a new rap battle and challenge the best rapper in Detroit, Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie), the leader of the local famous rap group gang 'Free World' and win it all. Will he win it? You got to watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the movie borderlines Eminem real life. Instead of the crazy Eminem Slim Shady that spit out hateful, violent, and somewhat silly lyrics, ranging from killing his wife, homophobia to making jokes about celebs. You really get a motivational type of a film about going after your dreams. You really see, Eminem as Jimmy grow into a positive responsibility for the direction of his life. It was very mature. Honestly, I don't think this movie would had work, if it's was all about moaning and groaning Slim Shady. I glad, Eminem took this seriously. After all, after this movie, his music had gotten more serious, and less Slim Shady like. Eminem even took an Oscar for Best Song that year for "Lose Yourself". It was the first time a rap/hip-hop song win an Academy Award reward. That's a big deal! Is Eminem, the best rapper? It's up in the air, depending what you think is music. After all, 2005's Encore & 2009's Relapse were some of his worst albums ever. Thank God for 2010's Recovery. But, it's still hard not to find yourself, jamming to "Lose Yourself" when you need a boost in your life. You can't help seeing how great, the raps were written in the film. My favorite one had to be the courtyard battle with the Xhibit cameo. Yeah, most of the raps were pretty funny and clever, both from Eminem and the lyrics from his real life friends, playing opponents like Proof who play Lil' Tic in the film. The acting is pretty good, all around. Eminem has never acted before this, but regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, he did a great job. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. Mad props go to Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's mentor, Future. Brittany Murphy as Alex, Jimmy's love-interest is mostly a miss than a hit for me. I don't find her attractive. Eminem-Murphy love scene in the plant was bit out of place. Taryn Manning's role as the ex-girlfriend is almost unnecessary. The only female character that really matter in this film, is the alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) as she play a great dealt in Eminem's life. I did find the whole sub-plot of her losing her home, a bit underdeveloped, as surprising near the climax, she miraculous won the bingo in a deus ex machina like fashion. I did love the symbolism of the burning house in the state of present day Detroit. Indeed the movie demonstrates processes of race, class, and segregation in the urban lower socio-economic environment. Indeed, it's hard to be proud of your neighborhood, when there are streets upon streets of abandoned building where people do drugs, murder, and loot. You really see how economic devastation and de-industrialization can hurt a city. Most of the movie is how much living in Detroit sucks type patting, until the predictable Rocky style final battle. It should had been shorter than its 110 minute run time. Honestly, another thing that bug me is that the movie is place in 1995's Detroit, but there is little to no mention of the time period. They should just save money and claim it was present day, because when I first saw it, I thought it was year 2002 in the settling. For an Eminem movie, it's pretty tame in the language and the violence. Don't get me wrong, it's R Rating for a reason, but I really think the producers were going for a PG-13 rating here. Yes, there's a lot of harsh language, but it didn't seem oddly place. Overall: If you're looking for a good urban underdog movie. You found one.

8 Mile is a 2002 hip hop drama film starring Eminem, Mekhi Phifer, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy and Michael Shannon. The movie is directed by Curtis Hanson. The Plot: The year is 1995 in Detroit, Michigan, USA. Jimmy "B-Rabbit" Smith,
 Jr. (Eminem), a worker and a poor man, struggles with life. He has moved back north of 8 Mile Road to a run-down trailer home in Warren, Michigan. There he lives with his alcoholic mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger), his little sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield), and Stephanie's abusive boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon). Jimmy is a rapper who his friends think that he is very talented. However, Jimmy has a lack of confidence about his ability. This anxiety causes him to choke and lose his rap battle at the hip-hop venue, "The Shelter", leaving the stage utterly humiliated.Jimmy works at New Detroit Stamping (a car factory). When he asks for extra shifts, his supervisor laughs in his face and rejects his request due to Jimmy's lateness to work. Jimmy becomes friends with Alex (Brittany Murphy). Over time, Jimmy becomes a lot more responsible for his actions and behaviors in the directions of his life. After he gains much improvement in his work ethic and behavior, his supervisor grants his request for extra shifts that he gave earlier.Stephanie receives a notice declaring that, because she and her family can not afford to pay the rent on her trailer, she and her family must vacate the premises immediately. Stephanie tries to keep it a secret, but Greg eventually finds out about it. Greg and Jimmy have a long and brutal fight, and when it's over, Greg leaves Stephanie for good. Jimmy has friend named Wink (Eugene Byrd), a radio DJ with links to a famous record label. Their friendship becomes torn after Wink does promotional work for Jimmy's rivals, "The Leaders of the Free World", a hip-hop group. Jimmy and his friends get into a brawl with the Free World and Jimmy's friend Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones) takes out a gun and accidentally shoots himself in the leg. He survives but is crippled and has to wear crutches.On lunch break at work one day, Mike (Xzibit), a lunch truck rapper insults a gay co-worker Paul (Craig Chandler). Jimmy joins the battle, roasting Mike and defending Paul. Alex is impressed by his actions and they go out on a date. Wink arranges for Jimmy to have a recording of a rap demo done at JLB, but when Jimmy gets there, he sees Wink doing it with Alex. Enraged, Jimmy beats up Wink. Alex yells at him to stop and eventually he does. In revengeful style or retaliation, the Free World assaults Jimmy and Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie), the leader of the gang, nearly kills Jimmy before being persuaded not to by Wink.Jimmy's beast friend and rap-host David "Future" Porter (Mekhi Phifer) encourages him to get revenge by competing against the Free World at the next rap battler at The Shelter. Jimmy's work conflicts with this, but Paul covers for him as a thank you for what Jimmy did earlier. Jimmy goes to the battle.Jimmy competes against the members of the Free World in every battle. 1st Round 1 - Lickety Split - wins. Round 2 - Lotto - wins. After winning the first two rounds he has to face Poppa Doc, the gang leader and the defending Rap Battle Champion. Jimmy raps first and exposes both his and Poppa Doc's weaknesses. Embarrassed with nothing to say back at Jimmy, Poppa Doc gives the mic back to Future. Jimmy wins the battle and is declared the NEW RAP BATTLE CHAMPION!After being congratulated by Alex and his friends, Future offers him a position as rap-battle host, alongside himself. Jimmy declines the offer stating he has to get back to work and make success on his own. He walks back to work with confidence and hope for the future. A rap masterpiece. 10/10.

Young man struggling with his life, job, love-life and everything, and how he gets out of that. He raps good, fast and works on his rap but has stage fright and how he gets out of this with motivation.It shows some good friends, good moments and getting the life back on track with them wheels on!

8 mile certainly started out interesting - we begin with Jimmy 'B Rabbit Smith' played by Eminem practicing rapping in front of a mirror. He then takes part in a 'rap battle' which he doesn't win as he 'chokes' or doesn't say anything. After the initial rap battle we start to learn a bit more about him and the problems that he faces - his girlfriend Janeane has dumped him, he's in a dead end job, he's forced to live with his mother and step father in their trailer park home and that his mother is facing eviction from her home. Whilst 8 mile started out great, I also had a lot of problems with the film which I'll attempt to explain one by one;1) Jimmy's crew - they consisted of David 'Future' Porter, Cheddar Bob, & Sol George. OK, I can understand Porter being part of this film, but what purpose did the other two crew members serve? They were just spare parts and I think they were only there to make up the numbers. The other issue is that these 3 characters weren't developed at all (I had to go back to the cast list as I forgot what they were called as I think their names were only mentioned once maybe)2) Music over dialogue - I realise that a lot of films have 'background' music whilst actors are having conversations, but to me the volume of the music during the conversations in 8 mile was ridiculously loud. At times, I couldn't hear what was being said so I tried turning the volume up but it just became unbearable. The conversations were doubtfully of any significance, but even so I found it very distracting and it made my head hurt.3) Pointless and unnecessary scenes - what was the point of the scene where Jimmy and his crew are driving round and randomly shooting at people? It served no purpose and just added an extra 10 minutes to the running time which could have been spent more constructively by developing some characters in the film. Then later setting fire to an 'abandoned house' as they believe a rapist lived there. Whilst in this instance, I understand that they did this because a 'rapist' used to live there and wanted to destroy it, but I still didn't see the point in including it in the film.4) The dialogue - hearing the words 'dawg' and 'man' every 2 minutes quickly became irritating. I know that's how rappers talk, but couldn't the writers have been more subtle?5) Alex - I thought that her character was fairly poorly written. Once introduced to Jimmy, she tells him that she thinks that he's a good rapper and that he'll go far. The 2 of them have sex, fall out, she then has sex with another man (who is a rival from another rapping troop) and Jimmy catches her out and beats up the other bloke. Afterwards, she comes and sees Jimmy at his place of work, announces she's leaving but says she's going to the club and hopes to see him there. Jimmy decides to go to the club to perform the 'rap battle' and seems to be OK with Alex. Have I missed something? This is the women who we all thought he was falling for who slept with another man and got caught out by Jimmy and didn't even say 'Sorry' and then Jimmy acts as if nothing happened. This just seemed odd and both Alex and Jimmy came across as false in my opinion.I didn't completely hate 8 mile and there were a few good moments. I enjoyed the 'rap battles' (particularly between Jimmy and the lunch truck rapper (played by Xzibit) and I liked the rap sequence that Jimmy and Porter did to sweet home alabama - I thought that was funny and clever. Eminem's acting was actually pretty good (much better than I thought it would be) and Kim Basinger also put in a good performance as Stephanie Smith (Jimmy's mother). Eminem's character Jimmy was the only character who was properly developed and thankfully his character was at least a fairly likable person (otherwise my rating would be even lower). He looked after his family, worked hard and was a decent person. The only problem was on a few occasions his fists were 5 seconds ahead of his brain. I gave it 5/10, mainly for Eminem's character and the 'rap battles'

I enjoyed this movie immensely. I thought it was a departure from the typical movies that star Hip-hop artists nowadays, which typically glorify the hip-hop lifestyle. Which is a very material lifestyle. This movie was pretty dark.I thought Eminem did a good job acting. I mean he's not going to win any Oscars for this role, but he does a very good job acting. If not for who he is, then you wouldn't pay too much attention to his acting because that's how competent he does.As most of you already have heard, this movie was based on Eminem's life, but none of the events are actually factual. His relationship with his mother (Basinger) is much more amiable than it is in real life, or at least how it comes across in his music.Brittany Murphy acts as his love interest, but most importantly his muse.There are some scenes that leave you scratching your head. One of which is the Eminem-Murphy love scene in the plant. It seems out of place and bad for the pacing of the film. Also Taryn Manning's role as the ex-girlfriend is almost unnecessary. The presence of her character is a key plot element that sets up the film, but the appearance of her character in the film by its end seems unnecessary due to the fact that it is underdeveloped. I wonder if there were more scenes involving Manning that were ultimately deleted via editing.Overall I enjoyed the movie. Some may not enjoy it as much, but that's probably because they go into the movie with different expectations. If you're expecting something other than a hip-hop based film that subtly comments on social/economic/racial issues, and is a pseudo-rags to riches story, then you  might be sorely disappointed.

This is a surprising good movie. It by no means is a great or truly memorable movie but it's a professionally made and good looking movie that is well worth to watch.The story isn't that new or original and the movie is quite formulaic and predictable at moments. Still the movie is perfectly watchable and good thanks to the profession it is made with. The story is told in an interesting way and the movie has some nice build up characters in it. It's mainly thanks to Curtis Hanson his directing and the perfectly dark atmospheric cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto that this movie is better than your average formulaic movie about a wannabe rapper from the wrong side of town. Also Eminem does a great job. Basically he plays himself but it works well for the movie its story. Even in the scene's with other professional actors, such as Kim Basinger who plays his mother, he holds up fine. I think he surprised everyone with his acting performance.Even though the movie has many formulaic moments in it and not many surprises, it still has some well constructed and build up sequences in it. All of the rap-battles in the movie are very enjoyable, especially the one at the ending. No, I'm not really into this type of music but I'm also not a hater of it. I simply enjoyed the rap-battles for the art of it. It's really like fighting each other with words and some of the sentences are just simply brilliant.Everyone that's open for it should be able to enjoy this movie. It's formulaic but made with lots of profession, which truly compensates for this.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

Watched this for the first time in 10 years recently. What a great film. A real statement of its time. Everything that was bad in the USA in the 1990's is perfectly illustrated, giving food for thought as well as inspiring empathy for a lost generation of young poor Americans. Living in Trailer parks, caught up in gangs - black against white.All this is the backdrop for some of the cleverest wordsmiths around, creating Rap and Hip Hop music including one Oscar winning songWon't be to everyone's taste - but everyone should watch it once in their lifetime

8 mile is not a rags to riches story, nor does it show how a rapper achieved stardom, its about a man trying to find his voice and himself in a doomed place. Eminem stars in this autobiographical piece & gives a rather fantastic performance. The cinematography brings out Detroit's Dreary & Hopeless ruins & its wasted youth who just want to get away from this place. The supporting cast did a good job & the rap battles at the end were Fire !! But the story isn't that powerful & very contained. The subplots aren't really well developed especially the romantic angle. Still a very fun watch.

I don`t wanna say too much about this flick........only this...now i didnt have high expectations for this one and i was amazed by the acting by Eminem, this guy really rocks and so does this movie....do yourself a favour a go see this one....MASTERPIECE

8 Mile, directed and produced by Curtis Hudson, portrays Marshall "Eminem" Mathers' life beautifully, incorporating the hard racial profiling, Em's real life events, while also adding in some believable fabricated scenes. Hudson doesn't come from the same background as Eminem, so you can tell that Hudson & Eminem had a great, trustworthy bond, creating this movie together.Mali Finn didn't cast quiet the all-star cast people would come see, but there was just enough raw emotion & charisma in all of the characters, to really build a great film, driven by the characters.The screenplay by Scott Silver, was very raw, and ghetto natured. The emotional scenes seemed too scripted; Eminem's raps saved the script from being just okay.The music and score all produced by Eminem, winning an Academy Award for Loose Yourself, was well thought out, beyond clever, and memorable. I personally tried to root for the antagonist rhymes, but they were all just inferior.The cinematography by the up and coming Rodrigo Prieto was beautifully lit, with these dreary and dark scenes, to set this dull tone. The art directors in Phillip Messina, Kevin Kavanaugh & Harry E. Otto, shot this in the best location possible, Detroit. All of the scenery was genuine to the feel and look of Detroit.Overall, Curtis Hudson did a very good job adapting his style to be able to put out such a genuine movie, with the great assistance from Eminem.

I don't care for too many dramas, but "8 mile" was an excellent movie. Eminem was a better actor than I could have dreamed for him to be. He put on a great show, and kept me interested throughout the entire movie. Mekhi Phifer did an excellent job and is definitely a rising star in Hollywood. Brittany Murphy could have done a better job, but I didn't like her character development at all. It seems that she flip flops around so much that in the end you really don't know which side she truly plays. Kim Basinger did a good job. I don't watch too many of her movies. The last movie I saw of hers' was "Bless the Child" and that was a major let down.
As for the plot, don't go into the movie thinking that you're going to see the life of Eminem. This is not about Eminem's life. Eminem said it himself in an interview. Mekhi Phifer even said that he didn't want to do the movie because he thought it was about Eminem's life and that Hollywood was just trying to take advantage of a rising star, but this isn't the case. This is just as any other movie, but this is Eminem's acting debut. Even though there are certain things in the movie that relate to Eminem's life (ex. 8 Mile Road,) this is certainly NOT an autobiography. If you go into "8 mile" expecting to see an action film with explosions and such then you're in for a let down. "8 Mile" is an amazing story about a white wannabe rapper trying to make it in the underground world of rapping. There isn't much action in this at all because it is a DRAMA, not an action. I hope you go see this movie if your in for a good story with some great characters!

Being that this is his first big role in a feature film, I was excited to see how well Eminem could act. I'm happy to say that he pulls it off perfectly. I didn't even think about that it was Eminem in the lead role, as he portrays his character perfectly. Even though it's similar to his real personality, it must have been hard for him. The rest of the actors mostly perform well too, actually pretty much everybody except Kim Basinger is completely believable. Unfortunately, she seems a bit out of place in this film, and she didn't portray her character too believably, in my opinion. The plot is interesting and keeps your attention, for the duration of the film. The characters are all believable. The cinematography is excellent; it really makes you feel that you're there, in every single scene, in every battle. Being a rap fan, I really enjoyed the rap music aspect of the film too, though I guess people who aren't into rap will dislike big parts of the film. I also felt that the ex-girlfriend subplot was a bit underdeveloped; it could have been take a bit further. Apart from that, and the acting of Kim Basinger, this couldn't have been much better. I really liked that it wasn't entirely autobiographical, that would have been predictable and probably boring, especially for us fans of Eminem who know his background well. I like what they did with the theme, and where they took the plot. Overall, a pretty good drama that could have been better. I'd recommend this to most fans of dramas, and fans of hip-hop/rap/Eminem. 7/10

This movie is something that really refreshed the Hollywood studio.It's preety different than the other movies because of it's really interesting plot and great cast(including Eminem).I have to say that Eminem did an amazing job on his debut and that he really was fascinating in a role that is maybe very autobiographical.Phenomenal soundtrack including 50 cent and Xzibit and of course "lose yourself"-the academy award winner.I think that the rap contest scenes are the best part of the movie, because they were made so realistic.After all, a movie that is surely creating maybe even an another genre in something that i called movie industry and a great try !

I didn't really like the first two acts of the movie and only loved the last one. I think it is not well paced and drags a lot. Loved the songs and that's really it.

But then again honey, if you did love this one, don't read any further. I was expecting some real funI was very disappointed. 8 MILE is just some bland schmaltzy melodrama about a kid making his way to the top in a wholly banal and uninteresting way . Now if this is supposed to have been inspiring and if indeed it did inspire some, good for them! I mean, it's nice to find out the flick proved of use. Art it ain't; fun, neither. I was expecting a much much better movie than this schmaltzy averageatthebest melodrama; it was quite praised, and the director being who he is, and as a Basinger fan, I thought this might be up to something. The poor script is, as a matter of fact, outrageously, and I mean outrageously bland and thin. The characters are nonexistentjust some cartoon silhouettes. Eminem's performance only amounts to some posing and dreadful posturing.An aimless story about void characters.Why did I expect something better, a flick of more worth? I guess I'm too like Eminem's charactertoo idealistic, I mean. I guess Eminem did not continue his budding acting career; this is good, this is soothing. But if you keep wishing to know my reading of the flick, then I think it's about a peed off kid who struggles to find a way developing his facility at expressing various rants and insults and slants in peculiarly rhymed language. I think that Slim Shady 's socalled verses suck. The script is, of course, rubbish; no character really exists. 8 MILE is but a purposely educative and simplistic melodrama, extremely childish and awkward in Eminem's naive posing as Cagney and Dean simultaneously. In a word, pretty everything's phony. Mrs. Basinger, though apparently a favorite of the shady director, has got again no stuff to play.

8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise, you probably expect one of two things, either a silly excuse for self-aggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hip-hop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in blue-collar and no-collar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled, powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents, carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself, not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard, unforgiving time and place, they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there; most of the film is shot on location in Detroit, and the gritty, sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where, for good or for ill, many people do live every day.  For one, 8 Mile might have the most believable, most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years, and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated, plot driving drama.  Good stuff.Of course, the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak, at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit, and the villains, a rival rap group known as the "Free World," are a little over the top, but, time and again, the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.Oh, and, in case you were wondering, there is rapping, and plenty of it. The rapping is really top-quality, cutting edge stuff, for the most part, and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap, not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time, not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen, this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before; it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way, and makes that gap look a lot smaller.All in all, the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second, the cast's intensity never gives up, and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed, finely crafted, and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence (and there is a bunch), I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.

I was afraid of this movie. For a long time I feared that one day, Eminem WOULD make a movie - and that movie would suck!!!!Along it came, and you know what? It didn't suck. Man, was I relieved. I have never been able to put a finger on Mr. Mathers' rapping skills, I think his technique is amazing. His rhymes are sharp and intelligent and he always performs them with pure justification. But could he take this to the big screen? He succeeded. In his debut movie he managed to play it real and natural. He had good on screen chemistry with pretty much all the characters, but especially with Brittany Murphy (Uh, gotta love that sex scene... That was hot.)The final battles in the movie, are the absolute climax. If you ever had any doubts about Eminmems talents - one way or the other - you definitely know his worth now!Some might say that it must be easy to play yourself, and it's not a secret that this movie is somewhat autobiographic. But it sure takes guts to put yourself out there like that, well done.So 8/10

Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith (Eminem) is desperate to be a rapper. It's 1995 Detroit. With the support of his friend David 'Future' Porter (Mekhi Phifer), he aims to overcome his personal problems. His mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger) is a drunk. He leaves his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) when she tells him that she's pregnant. He chokes on a head-to-head rap battle. He has no place to go but to move back into his mother's trailer. His mom's boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon) is a jerk. He has a part-time grimy auto parts job and then he meets Alex (Brittany Murphy).Eminem is basically playing himself and he does a good job. He's surrounded by good actors. The sense of the place is the standout of this movie. The Detroit locations have the proper grittiness. The desperation is palpable. The rap battles are exhilarating. The story is relatively standard with nice touches. This is a matter of the perfect story for the perfect lead. He's not really acting as much as being himself.

Rap is not my cup of tea.
But this movie is very well interpreted and perfectly holds water!

Those who are saying `8 Mile' shows a vanilla-ed Eminem may have a point: this movie introduces him to a non-rap audience just as `Wild Style' introduced us to hip-hop.  But those who say Eminem is sanitized here for mall viewing have an odd notion of language.  Perhaps his CD's contain more inflammatory material than is aired in this movie, but what gets said here is most definitely not for any suburban grandmothers who aren't stone deaf.It's surprising - admirable, really - how well Curtis Hansen and his crew keep track of the plot from scene to scene when not much of it seems to matter other than Rabbit's problems with his mother, Stephanie Smith -- Kim Basinger.  Bassinger is a blue ribbon southern white trash trailor park mom. You can't help feeling that with minor tweaking she could be the mother of a Grosse Pointe prep school boy, a lady whose problem was overspending instead of imminent eviction from a stinky trailor.  Bassinger makes trashiness look attractive, just as she made movie star decay attractive when Hansen directed her in `L.A. Confidential' six years ago.  Rabbit's problems with girlfriends aren't significant, though he has two of them, an ex and a new one. Both are delicious but primed for rejection.  Rabbit's closest relationships are with his emcee pal `Future' (played by an utterly charming and huggable Mikhi Pfifer) and his slightly retarded token white homie, Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones).But his closest relationship of all is with himself, as is clear from the first scene, where Eminem is doing rap gestures in the competition shed men's room, looking in the mirror, hearing his music in his head --and this is fine, because it's what a young man has to do:  get on friendly working terms with who he is.  The movie is about his going off to be on his own and give up his rowdy playmates to become a winner, and he walks off by himself in the final scene.  The comparison with Shakespeare's Henry IV isn't out of place.  The Shakespearean parallel was used explicitly for Keanu Reeves' character in `My Own Private Idaho' but the theme is really more central here. Eminem isn't a cold personality like Keanu Reeves in Van Sant's movie. He is close to his mates and they're always touching hands and gently hugging each other.  The hands and the hugs are one of the main images that stay with you after seeing `8 Mile.'Eminem as shown in `8 Mile' isn't totally motivated by his anger at all. His anger is very contained.  He seems able to turn it on and off at will and release it only when he needs it --  to trounce rap competition or throw out his mom's sleazy boyfriend.  It's his ability to control his anger that makes both Rabbit and Eminem winners.Eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen.  Paradoxically he projects a powerful inwardness, so that his turning away from everybody makes his face jump out at us.  His effect is of authenticity, because he doesn't put on a reaction to please the audience or suit the scene, but he is always there, moving with the scene and in fact creating it.`8 Mile' isn't just a vehicle for Eminem.  It's too well made a movie to be that.  But without Eminem `8 Mile' wouldn't exist.  The only importance of the rapping contests emceed by `Future' is that first Rabbit shies away from them, and then he enters them and wins them.  You have to wonder how the rapper/actors feel who are in the movie only to be put down by Eminem.`8 Mile' cannot escape from the limitations of the fictionalized star biopic.  There have been dozens of movies about emerging music stars and their families, their early sponsors, their first big breaks, and so on, many of them with more range and specificity of detail than this one. This movie only takes its hero to the moment when he walks away, having shown that he can be a star.  The whole focus is on his personality, and in particular his stillness.  The most important moments are those when Rabbit/Eminem stands with mike in hand, silent, waiting for inspiration to strike.  Even when he choses not to compete and hands the mike back, this moment is full of power.  In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence, raw potential, to a new level of clarity and confidence.This rapper is good just standing there.

This movie was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised! I wasn't an Eminem fan going into the movie but I'm certainly one now. Seeing how different things are on the 'other side of the tracks' was a big eye opener for me.  I loved the script, the actors, the music - basically I loved everything all the way down to the lighting.  It's got everything for everyone in it! Comedy, drama, action, fighting, guns, drugs, sex, and of course - Bunny Rabbit. I loved the movie. I laughed so hard I cried at times and then I just flat out cried at others. I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone whether they are an Eminem fan or not. Do be careful trying to get into it though. We had to go to four different movie theaters before my 16-year-old friend could get in. They're checking I.D.'s on this one BIG time. Anyway - go see the movie! You'll love it! I swear on my grave it's the best movie that I've seen in a long time!

I think the most impressive thing about 8 Mile is that Eminem isn't a terrible actor. Or maybe he's just playing a character so close to himself that he doesn't have to act. The story is predictable, so there's not a lot of tension while watching it. Also, I found myself wondering why these untelevised, unpublicized rap battles were such a big deal for grown adults. Nevertheless, it's a satisfactory underdog story that I'm glad I finally watched.

"8 Mile" is the new film that features controversial rapper Eminem in his first starring role.  The film itself is loosely based on his life growing up in Detroit.  Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr. a.k.a. "Rabbit", a young man who is struggling to make things better for himself through "battles", which are freestyling rap contests that are usually held at a local nightclub. Rabbit chokes when it is his turn to take the microphone for the first time. His best friend, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the host of these battles and strongly believes Rabbit has potential, but the problem is that Future often makes his decisions before consulting with Rabbit first.  Rabbit's home life is not much better.  He's broke, has no place to live, he's stuck in a dead-end job at a steel mill, and his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) has fooled him into thinking that she is pregnant.  Rabbit's mother (Kim Basinger), is on the verge of being evicted from her home and is slutting around with a man who is about the same age as her son.  Things in Rabbit's life take a turn for the better when he later falls in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring young woman who dreams of becoming a model and moving to New York to start life a new."8 Mile" certainly is a moving and very touching drama.  Eminem proves here that he really can act and in fact may have a future in motion pictures. This does not mean we will be hearing him thanking his producer Paul Rosenberg next year at the Oscars, but we can expect to him to receive a lot of praise for future movie roles.  It's quite obvious that some people will not like "8 Mile", just because of Eminem's controversial history.  The film also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time.  Eminem's hit single "Lose Yourself" really does have a lot emotion put into it.   
Eminem, since he burst onto the music scene in 1999 with his critically-acclaimed/lambasted album "The Slim Shady LP", he has been met with a lot of controversy, as well as praise.  Despite the often humorous content of his songs, there are many dark under tones in them as well.  In my opinion, too much has been made about his lyrics, most of which revolve around topics like homophobia, murder, and his failed relationship with his on/off wife, Kim.  Despite all of this, I think that people have overlooked the fact that he said the only thing that truly matters to him is his daughter, Hailie Jade.  Also, if people believed Eminem really was a homophobic, do you still think he would have agreed to perform "Stan" with Elton John?  As a longtime fan of Eminem and his music, I try not to let such criticisms get to me, but sometimes you just have to say "What the hell?  Are they really necessary?"  I don't think so.  The problem is that people today are just too biased when it comes to people like Eminem.  He's not another Vanilla Ice and "8 Mile" is not an attempt to cash in on his success like "Cool As Ice" was.  I have a list of grievances that people need to realize about Eminem:First of all, do not disrespect this man.  I feel that many of the people who hate Eminem have never actually listened to one of his songs.  In my opinion, they have only listened to small clips that have been played on some discussion about his controversial lyrics.  If you actually listened to some of his songs, you'll realize that he is a very distraught young person with a lot to say.Don't watch "8 Mile" with a predetermined mindset.  People who have already made up their minds about Eminem's talents are less likely to enjoy themselves much more than people who believe in him.  To non-believers, if Eminem really did not have any talent, like so many people seem to think now, how is it that all of his records: "The Slim Shady LP", "The Marshall Mathers LP", "Devils Night" (with group D-12) and "The Eminem Show" together have grossed more than $12 million?  I think that it is a clear sign of TRUE TALENT.Also do you believe had Eminem been black and rapping about such "controversial" subject matter, that he would be famous like he is now?  No, because most likely no one would dare even produce him.  That said, I'm African-American and I don't care that Eminem is white and is rapping about such things.I think that too many people have made his race too big of an issue. Eminem knows that he is white and will be nothing else.  He does not display to us a "thuggish" image that some people think that any rapper should have. Also, he does not rap about the things that some people seem to think is destroying rap music.Eminem does have quite a future in store for him.  I'm sure that we can expect to be seeing a lot more of him later on.

8 Mile tells the story of a white kid on the wrong side of the tracks living in Detroit with a dead end job and a trailer park mom.  Deep inside, he aspires to break free from the chains of the reality of his life through the poetry and passion and rawness of rap; the one place he can possibly gain a feeling of purpose and hear his own voice.  Obviously, it's no big secret that this storyline runs very parallel to that of of Eminem's own roots and his own aspirations.  Where fiction and reality collide is blurred and that works for the picture.  First off, I think Curtis Hanson did a great job rebuilding that world and protecting his novice lead.  He understood the material and I was drawn in to the world that he recreated.  Also, the cinematography widely lends itself towards upping the ante of the picture and making you feel the authenticity of a world and a place where many of us have never traveled nor never will.  As for Eminem himself, at first I found him a little stoic, but given the fact that this guy has never acted before, regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, I thought he did a decent job in front of the camera.  Hanson was wise to protect his lead with awesome supporting work from Mekhi Phifer and pretty much everyone else that portrays his friends and peers in the film.  Eminem obviously was a little green and surrounding him with these actors gave the movie and Eminem's journey more credence.  Brittany Murphy was also very good, but I found her character to be a bit expedient.  She definitely was not used to her full potential and I felt that if they had used her relationship with Rabbit to a larger or deeper extent, it only would have lent more to the film. One of the scenes I was most impressed with was the sex scene between Murphy and Eminem.  Gone were the Hollywood antics of glossing it up or ghetto fabulous and I felt that Hanson captured something that was fascinating, uncomfortable and realistic that I haven't seen in a Hollywood film before. Now for what I feel made this movie not rise to the top...  First off, when Kim Basinger first came on the screen and opened her mouth, I thought the rest of the film was going to be destined for failure.  Not only was she weak in the role, she was grossly miscast.  There are so many actresses in that age range that I find it mind boggling that Basinger was used for something in which she stood out like a fish out of water.  The film also almost lost me in the beginning due to the length of the first scene in the bathroom when Eminem is psyching himself up.  The placement of the scene wasn't a problem but it went on way too long - I would have prepared an edited down version.  If you're watching Robert DeNiro for that long looking in a mirror, yes, it'll probably work, but to put that type of pressure on a first timer with no training, especially since it's shortly followed by Basinger's first scene was a risky move and one that I think they could have found a better choice for.  The other thing that kept this film from being a totally strong film for me was the screenplay itself.  I kept finding myself asking why the hell Scott Silver had some of these extraneous scenes in the story.  There was a good story to be told here and a whole world to be explored by the general public that doesn't know that much of it, and the script and film could have and should have been a good 25 minutes shorter and tighter. Anyway, still an intriguing film.  And interesting insight into a different side of life and I commend Eminem for taking the risk.  It's a lot to bite off and half the country is just dying for a chance to decimate him.  If for nothing else, this film is worth the last 5 minutes.  When he was up there battling, I actually started clapping and cheering out loud in the theater - no matter where he stands as an actor, when he's in his domain, he is fantastic, whether you like what he's saying or not. A 7 out of 10 for a movie that was actually worth spending a budget on. Not perfect, but definitely it's own thing with some good moments.  And when they're good, they're really good.

8 mile is the best movie i have ever seen.
the story of this movie is about Eminem life and what he had done for become what he is now. from when everyone bully him to when everyone respected him and his music 
if you count Eminem is not an actor he done very well as a protagonist.
I recommend this movie because Eminem is one of the best artist in the work and who follow him have to see it for understand what he went through when he was younger.

It's time for a Battle! Directed by Curtis Hanson, the movie is a semi-autobiographical account of Eminem's early years in Detroit, struggling to make ends meet and get his rap career off the ground. The film stars Eminem as Jimmy "B-Rabbit' Smith, whom life isn't going anywhere. He can't seem to get any respect among with his peers after choking in a previous rap battle tournament. The only way, he could show the world, he meets business, is to sign up for a new rap battle and challenge the best rapper in Detroit, Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie), the leader of the local famous rap group gang 'Free World' and win it all. Will he win it? You got to watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the movie borderlines Eminem real life. Instead of the crazy Eminem Slim Shady that spit out hateful, violent, and somewhat silly lyrics, ranging from killing his wife, homophobia to making jokes about celebs. You really get a motivational type of a film about going after your dreams. You really see, Eminem as Jimmy grow into a positive responsibility for the direction of his life. It was very mature. Honestly, I don't think this movie would had work, if it's was all about moaning and groaning Slim Shady. I glad, Eminem took this seriously. After all, after this movie, his music had gotten more serious, and less Slim Shady like. Eminem even took an Oscar for Best Song that year for "Lose Yourself". It was the first time a rap/hip-hop song win an Academy Award reward. That's a big deal! Is Eminem, the best rapper? It's up in the air, depending what you think is music. After all, 2005's Encore & 2009's Relapse were some of his worst albums ever. Thank God for 2010's Recovery. But, it's still hard not to find yourself, jamming to "Lose Yourself" when you need a boost in your life. You can't help seeing how great, the raps were written in the film. My favorite one had to be the courtyard battle with the Xhibit cameo. Yeah, most of the raps were pretty funny and clever, both from Eminem and the lyrics from his real life friends, playing opponents like Proof who play Lil' Tic in the film. The acting is pretty good, all around. Eminem has never acted before this, but regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, he did a great job. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. Mad props go to Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's mentor, Future. Brittany Murphy as Alex, Jimmy's love-interest is mostly a miss than a hit for me. I don't find her attractive. Eminem-Murphy love scene in the plant was bit out of place. Taryn Manning's role as the ex-girlfriend is almost unnecessary. The only female character that really matter in this film, is the alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) as she play a great dealt in Eminem's life. I did find the whole sub-plot of her losing her home, a bit underdeveloped, as surprising near the climax, she miraculous won the bingo in a deus ex machina like fashion. I did love the symbolism of the burning house in the state of present day Detroit. Indeed the movie demonstrates processes of race, class, and segregation in the urban lower socio-economic environment. Indeed, it's hard to be proud of your neighborhood, when there are streets upon streets of abandoned building where people do drugs, murder, and loot. You really see how economic devastation and de-industrialization can hurt a city. Most of the movie is how much living in Detroit sucks type patting, until the predictable Rocky style final battle. It should had been shorter than its 110 minute run time. Honestly, another thing that bug me is that the movie is place in 1995's Detroit, but there is little to no mention of the time period. They should just save money and claim it was present day, because when I first saw it, I thought it was year 2002 in the settling. For an Eminem movie, it's pretty tame in the language and the violence. Don't get me wrong, it's R Rating for a reason, but I really think the producers were going for a PG-13 rating here. Yes, there's a lot of harsh language, but it didn't seem oddly place. Overall: If you're looking for a good urban underdog movie. You found one.

8 Mile is a 2002 hip hop drama film starring Eminem, Mekhi Phifer, Kim Basinger, Brittany Murphy and Michael Shannon. The movie is directed by Curtis Hanson. The Plot: The year is 1995 in Detroit, Michigan, USA. Jimmy "B-Rabbit" Smith,
 Jr. (Eminem), a worker and a poor man, struggles with life. He has moved back north of 8 Mile Road to a run-down trailer home in Warren, Michigan. There he lives with his alcoholic mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger), his little sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield), and Stephanie's abusive boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon). Jimmy is a rapper who his friends think that he is very talented. However, Jimmy has a lack of confidence about his ability. This anxiety causes him to choke and lose his rap battle at the hip-hop venue, "The Shelter", leaving the stage utterly humiliated.Jimmy works at New Detroit Stamping (a car factory). When he asks for extra shifts, his supervisor laughs in his face and rejects his request due to Jimmy's lateness to work. Jimmy becomes friends with Alex (Brittany Murphy). Over time, Jimmy becomes a lot more responsible for his actions and behaviors in the directions of his life. After he gains much improvement in his work ethic and behavior, his supervisor grants his request for extra shifts that he gave earlier.Stephanie receives a notice declaring that, because she and her family can not afford to pay the rent on her trailer, she and her family must vacate the premises immediately. Stephanie tries to keep it a secret, but Greg eventually finds out about it. Greg and Jimmy have a long and brutal fight, and when it's over, Greg leaves Stephanie for good. Jimmy has friend named Wink (Eugene Byrd), a radio DJ with links to a famous record label. Their friendship becomes torn after Wink does promotional work for Jimmy's rivals, "The Leaders of the Free World", a hip-hop group. Jimmy and his friends get into a brawl with the Free World and Jimmy's friend Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones) takes out a gun and accidentally shoots himself in the leg. He survives but is crippled and has to wear crutches.On lunch break at work one day, Mike (Xzibit), a lunch truck rapper insults a gay co-worker Paul (Craig Chandler). Jimmy joins the battle, roasting Mike and defending Paul. Alex is impressed by his actions and they go out on a date. Wink arranges for Jimmy to have a recording of a rap demo done at JLB, but when Jimmy gets there, he sees Wink doing it with Alex. Enraged, Jimmy beats up Wink. Alex yells at him to stop and eventually he does. In revengeful style or retaliation, the Free World assaults Jimmy and Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie), the leader of the gang, nearly kills Jimmy before being persuaded not to by Wink.Jimmy's beast friend and rap-host David "Future" Porter (Mekhi Phifer) encourages him to get revenge by competing against the Free World at the next rap battler at The Shelter. Jimmy's work conflicts with this, but Paul covers for him as a thank you for what Jimmy did earlier. Jimmy goes to the battle.Jimmy competes against the members of the Free World in every battle. 1st Round 1 - Lickety Split - wins. Round 2 - Lotto - wins. After winning the first two rounds he has to face Poppa Doc, the gang leader and the defending Rap Battle Champion. Jimmy raps first and exposes both his and Poppa Doc's weaknesses. Embarrassed with nothing to say back at Jimmy, Poppa Doc gives the mic back to Future. Jimmy wins the battle and is declared the NEW RAP BATTLE CHAMPION!After being congratulated by Alex and his friends, Future offers him a position as rap-battle host, alongside himself. Jimmy declines the offer stating he has to get back to work and make success on his own. He walks back to work with confidence and hope for the future. A rap masterpiece. 10/10.

Young man struggling with his life, job, love-life and everything, and how he gets out of that. He raps good, fast and works on his rap but has stage fright and how he gets out of this with motivation.It shows some good friends, good moments and getting the life back on track with them wheels on!

8 mile certainly started out interesting - we begin with Jimmy 'B Rabbit Smith' played by Eminem practicing rapping in front of a mirror. He then takes part in a 'rap battle' which he doesn't win as he 'chokes' or doesn't say anything. After the initial rap battle we start to learn a bit more about him and the problems that he faces - his girlfriend Janeane has dumped him, he's in a dead end job, he's forced to live with his mother and step father in their trailer park home and that his mother is facing eviction from her home. Whilst 8 mile started out great, I also had a lot of problems with the film which I'll attempt to explain one by one;1) Jimmy's crew - they consisted of David 'Future' Porter, Cheddar Bob, & Sol George. OK, I can understand Porter being part of this film, but what purpose did the other two crew members serve? They were just spare parts and I think they were only there to make up the numbers. The other issue is that these 3 characters weren't developed at all (I had to go back to the cast list as I forgot what they were called as I think their names were only mentioned once maybe)2) Music over dialogue - I realise that a lot of films have 'background' music whilst actors are having conversations, but to me the volume of the music during the conversations in 8 mile was ridiculously loud. At times, I couldn't hear what was being said so I tried turning the volume up but it just became unbearable. The conversations were doubtfully of any significance, but even so I found it very distracting and it made my head hurt.3) Pointless and unnecessary scenes - what was the point of the scene where Jimmy and his crew are driving round and randomly shooting at people? It served no purpose and just added an extra 10 minutes to the running time which could have been spent more constructively by developing some characters in the film. Then later setting fire to an 'abandoned house' as they believe a rapist lived there. Whilst in this instance, I understand that they did this because a 'rapist' used to live there and wanted to destroy it, but I still didn't see the point in including it in the film.4) The dialogue - hearing the words 'dawg' and 'man' every 2 minutes quickly became irritating. I know that's how rappers talk, but couldn't the writers have been more subtle?5) Alex - I thought that her character was fairly poorly written. Once introduced to Jimmy, she tells him that she thinks that he's a good rapper and that he'll go far. The 2 of them have sex, fall out, she then has sex with another man (who is a rival from another rapping troop) and Jimmy catches her out and beats up the other bloke. Afterwards, she comes and sees Jimmy at his place of work, announces she's leaving but says she's going to the club and hopes to see him there. Jimmy decides to go to the club to perform the 'rap battle' and seems to be OK with Alex. Have I missed something? This is the women who we all thought he was falling for who slept with another man and got caught out by Jimmy and didn't even say 'Sorry' and then Jimmy acts as if nothing happened. This just seemed odd and both Alex and Jimmy came across as false in my opinion.I didn't completely hate 8 mile and there were a few good moments. I enjoyed the 'rap battles' (particularly between Jimmy and the lunch truck rapper (played by Xzibit) and I liked the rap sequence that Jimmy and Porter did to sweet home alabama - I thought that was funny and clever. Eminem's acting was actually pretty good (much better than I thought it would be) and Kim Basinger also put in a good performance as Stephanie Smith (Jimmy's mother). Eminem's character Jimmy was the only character who was properly developed and thankfully his character was at least a fairly likable person (otherwise my rating would be even lower). He looked after his family, worked hard and was a decent person. The only problem was on a few occasions his fists were 5 seconds ahead of his brain. I gave it 5/10, mainly for Eminem's character and the 'rap battles'

I enjoyed this movie immensely. I thought it was a departure from the typical movies that star Hip-hop artists nowadays, which typically glorify the hip-hop lifestyle. Which is a very material lifestyle. This movie was pretty dark.I thought Eminem did a good job acting. I mean he's not going to win any Oscars for this role, but he does a very good job acting. If not for who he is, then you wouldn't pay too much attention to his acting because that's how competent he does.As most of you already have heard, this movie was based on Eminem's life, but none of the events are actually factual. His relationship with his mother (Basinger) is much more amiable than it is in real life, or at least how it comes across in his music.Brittany Murphy acts as his love interest, but most importantly his muse.There are some scenes that leave you scratching your head. One of which is the Eminem-Murphy love scene in the plant. It seems out of place and bad for the pacing of the film. Also Taryn Manning's role as the ex-girlfriend is almost unnecessary. The presence of her character is a key plot element that sets up the film, but the appearance of her character in the film by its end seems unnecessary due to the fact that it is underdeveloped. I wonder if there were more scenes involving Manning that were ultimately deleted via editing.Overall I enjoyed the movie. Some may not enjoy it as much, but that's probably because they go into the movie with different expectations. If you're expecting something other than a hip-hop based film that subtly comments on social/economic/racial issues, and is a pseudo-rags to riches story, then you  might be sorely disappointed.

This is a surprising good movie. It by no means is a great or truly memorable movie but it's a professionally made and good looking movie that is well worth to watch.The story isn't that new or original and the movie is quite formulaic and predictable at moments. Still the movie is perfectly watchable and good thanks to the profession it is made with. The story is told in an interesting way and the movie has some nice build up characters in it. It's mainly thanks to Curtis Hanson his directing and the perfectly dark atmospheric cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto that this movie is better than your average formulaic movie about a wannabe rapper from the wrong side of town. Also Eminem does a great job. Basically he plays himself but it works well for the movie its story. Even in the scene's with other professional actors, such as Kim Basinger who plays his mother, he holds up fine. I think he surprised everyone with his acting performance.Even though the movie has many formulaic moments in it and not many surprises, it still has some well constructed and build up sequences in it. All of the rap-battles in the movie are very enjoyable, especially the one at the ending. No, I'm not really into this type of music but I'm also not a hater of it. I simply enjoyed the rap-battles for the art of it. It's really like fighting each other with words and some of the sentences are just simply brilliant.Everyone that's open for it should be able to enjoy this movie. It's formulaic but made with lots of profession, which truly compensates for this.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

Watched this for the first time in 10 years recently. What a great film. A real statement of its time. Everything that was bad in the USA in the 1990's is perfectly illustrated, giving food for thought as well as inspiring empathy for a lost generation of young poor Americans. Living in Trailer parks, caught up in gangs - black against white.All this is the backdrop for some of the cleverest wordsmiths around, creating Rap and Hip Hop music including one Oscar winning songWon't be to everyone's taste - but everyone should watch it once in their lifetime

8 Mile, directed and produced by Curtis Hudson, portrays Marshall "Eminem" Mathers' life beautifully, incorporating the hard racial profiling, Em's real life events, while also adding in some believable fabricated scenes. Hudson doesn't come from the same background as Eminem, so you can tell that Hudson & Eminem had a great, trustworthy bond, creating this movie together.Mali Finn didn't cast quiet the all-star cast people would come see, but there was just enough raw emotion & charisma in all of the characters, to really build a great film, driven by the characters.The screenplay by Scott Silver, was very raw, and ghetto natured. The emotional scenes seemed too scripted; Eminem's raps saved the script from being just okay.The music and score all produced by Eminem, winning an Academy Award for Loose Yourself, was well thought out, beyond clever, and memorable. I personally tried to root for the antagonist rhymes, but they were all just inferior.The cinematography by the up and coming Rodrigo Prieto was beautifully lit, with these dreary and dark scenes, to set this dull tone. The art directors in Phillip Messina, Kevin Kavanaugh & Harry E. Otto, shot this in the best location possible, Detroit. All of the scenery was genuine to the feel and look of Detroit.Overall, Curtis Hudson did a very good job adapting his style to be able to put out such a genuine movie, with the great assistance from Eminem.

I don`t wanna say too much about this flick........only this...now i didnt have high expectations for this one and i was amazed by the acting by Eminem, this guy really rocks and so does this movie....do yourself a favour a go see this one....MASTERPIECE

Being that this is his first big role in a feature film, I was excited to see how well Eminem could act. I'm happy to say that he pulls it off perfectly. I didn't even think about that it was Eminem in the lead role, as he portrays his character perfectly. Even though it's similar to his real personality, it must have been hard for him. The rest of the actors mostly perform well too, actually pretty much everybody except Kim Basinger is completely believable. Unfortunately, she seems a bit out of place in this film, and she didn't portray her character too believably, in my opinion. The plot is interesting and keeps your attention, for the duration of the film. The characters are all believable. The cinematography is excellent; it really makes you feel that you're there, in every single scene, in every battle. Being a rap fan, I really enjoyed the rap music aspect of the film too, though I guess people who aren't into rap will dislike big parts of the film. I also felt that the ex-girlfriend subplot was a bit underdeveloped; it could have been take a bit further. Apart from that, and the acting of Kim Basinger, this couldn't have been much better. I really liked that it wasn't entirely autobiographical, that would have been predictable and probably boring, especially for us fans of Eminem who know his background well. I like what they did with the theme, and where they took the plot. Overall, a pretty good drama that could have been better. I'd recommend this to most fans of dramas, and fans of hip-hop/rap/Eminem. 7/10

I don't care for too many dramas, but "8 mile" was an excellent movie. Eminem was a better actor than I could have dreamed for him to be. He put on a great show, and kept me interested throughout the entire movie. Mekhi Phifer did an excellent job and is definitely a rising star in Hollywood. Brittany Murphy could have done a better job, but I didn't like her character development at all. It seems that she flip flops around so much that in the end you really don't know which side she truly plays. Kim Basinger did a good job. I don't watch too many of her movies. The last movie I saw of hers' was "Bless the Child" and that was a major let down.
As for the plot, don't go into the movie thinking that you're going to see the life of Eminem. This is not about Eminem's life. Eminem said it himself in an interview. Mekhi Phifer even said that he didn't want to do the movie because he thought it was about Eminem's life and that Hollywood was just trying to take advantage of a rising star, but this isn't the case. This is just as any other movie, but this is Eminem's acting debut. Even though there are certain things in the movie that relate to Eminem's life (ex. 8 Mile Road,) this is certainly NOT an autobiography. If you go into "8 mile" expecting to see an action film with explosions and such then you're in for a let down. "8 Mile" is an amazing story about a white wannabe rapper trying to make it in the underground world of rapping. There isn't much action in this at all because it is a DRAMA, not an action. I hope you go see this movie if your in for a good story with some great characters!

8 mile is not a rags to riches story, nor does it show how a rapper achieved stardom, its about a man trying to find his voice and himself in a doomed place. Eminem stars in this autobiographical piece & gives a rather fantastic performance. The cinematography brings out Detroit's Dreary & Hopeless ruins & its wasted youth who just want to get away from this place. The supporting cast did a good job & the rap battles at the end were Fire !! But the story isn't that powerful & very contained. The subplots aren't really well developed especially the romantic angle. Still a very fun watch.

This movie is something that really refreshed the Hollywood studio.It's preety different than the other movies because of it's really interesting plot and great cast(including Eminem).I have to say that Eminem did an amazing job on his debut and that he really was fascinating in a role that is maybe very autobiographical.Phenomenal soundtrack including 50 cent and Xzibit and of course "lose yourself"-the academy award winner.I think that the rap contest scenes are the best part of the movie, because they were made so realistic.After all, a movie that is surely creating maybe even an another genre in something that i called movie industry and a great try !

I didn't really like the first two acts of the movie and only loved the last one. I think it is not well paced and drags a lot. Loved the songs and that's really it.

But then again honey, if you did love this one, don't read any further. I was expecting some real funI was very disappointed. 8 MILE is just some bland schmaltzy melodrama about a kid making his way to the top in a wholly banal and uninteresting way . Now if this is supposed to have been inspiring and if indeed it did inspire some, good for them! I mean, it's nice to find out the flick proved of use. Art it ain't; fun, neither. I was expecting a much much better movie than this schmaltzy averageatthebest melodrama; it was quite praised, and the director being who he is, and as a Basinger fan, I thought this might be up to something. The poor script is, as a matter of fact, outrageously, and I mean outrageously bland and thin. The characters are nonexistentjust some cartoon silhouettes. Eminem's performance only amounts to some posing and dreadful posturing.An aimless story about void characters.Why did I expect something better, a flick of more worth? I guess I'm too like Eminem's charactertoo idealistic, I mean. I guess Eminem did not continue his budding acting career; this is good, this is soothing. But if you keep wishing to know my reading of the flick, then I think it's about a peed off kid who struggles to find a way developing his facility at expressing various rants and insults and slants in peculiarly rhymed language. I think that Slim Shady 's socalled verses suck. The script is, of course, rubbish; no character really exists. 8 MILE is but a purposely educative and simplistic melodrama, extremely childish and awkward in Eminem's naive posing as Cagney and Dean simultaneously. In a word, pretty everything's phony. Mrs. Basinger, though apparently a favorite of the shady director, has got again no stuff to play.
