After decades I have seen it again on Netflix. Great pictures and well executed combat scenes with the Russian military helicopters. Good actors who played their roles perfectly.Interesting to see Sylvester Stallone that I like very much as actor.Now I am curious to see Rambo 4 and the last one part 5. This legendary franchise merits 7/10.

Having single-handedly defeated the Vietcong in First Blood Part II, there was no going back for John Rambo: once a tortured soul, he was now a larger-than-life comic-book hero righting the world's wrongs through extreme violence and that was how he would have to stay in order to keep his fans happy. Rambo's next mission would have to be bigger, the villains more evil, and the body count higher. With the US in the midst of a cold war with Russia, the answer was obvious: send Rambo to kick Russian butt in Afghanistan.Armed with a knife that would shame Crocodile Dundee, several big guns, and his trusty bow with explosive-tipped arrows, Rambo frees his ex-commanding officer Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) from a Soviet fort and liberates the Mujahadin, laying waste to hundreds of the enemy in the process.But while the film's numerous battle scenes certainly deliver on the promise of much carnage, with some of the biggest on-screen explosions of the 80s, the film offers little in the way of genuine excitement or tension thanks to Rambo being virtually indestructible. The spectacular action also has the effect of making proceedings seem rather dull whenever Stallone eases off the trigger, resulting in this film being a marginally less enjoyable affair overall than the previous movies.Ironically, for all of Rambo III's glorification of violence in the name of a noble cause, the closing message, dedicating the film to 'the gallant people of Afghanistan', unintentionally but effectively illustrates the futility of war.

Rambo III is a action film as simple as that. a hero that does nearly impossible things and thats the attraction of a action hero he's not a real person it's a movie. movies like this just want to entertain you for 90mins. to 2hrs. and no matter how impossible or unrealistic things are you take it for what it is. that's the idea of wild action films they take you to another place, as a film lover i try not to have such high hopes for things, i want to see it with just a open mind . some things you will like and some you don't. rambo III is one i like. people talk about plot and what this film does and does not do . this film gives you just what you think it will.

With the highest budget of the three movies, the movie certainly looks expensive, with an epic scope at times. But you never quite get the feeling that the movie settles into a comfortable groove. Though the action sequences have plenty of gunshots and explosions, the way they are filmed - and edited - doesn't have the right impact or flow, like the action sequences in the second installment. In another comparison to the second installment, the story - while as sparse as this one - certainly kept moving. Here there are a number of segments that move very slowly and/or don't seem to have much purpose. The movie should have gotten down to business. The uneven flow of the movie also suffers near the end, as if the movie all of a sudden decides it needs to wrap things up in a few minutes, making the final battle almost come out of nowhere. (In fairness to the director, it should be pointed out that he was a sudden replacement after original director Russell Mulcahy was fired, and had only ONE DAY to prepare to helm the rest of the movie.)Like the previous installment, there is some dumb dialogue, but this time around it's not delivered in a slight tongue-in-cheek manner. If they had been willing to show this time around that they weren't taking things so seriously, it would have helped. You might say that the actor playing the Russian commander is not playing things seriously, but he goes SO over the top that he's embarrassing.It's watchable, but disappointing - they had the chance to make a kick-ass action movie here.By the way, the Afghans that Rambo helps in this movie are *NOT* the Taliban. People seem to forget that Afghanistan is made up of a number of different tribes. You can tell these particular Afghans are not the Taliban, because (among other things), the women are not completely covered, and the men play the traditional Afghan game with horses and a goat's skin (forbidden by the Taliban.)

Three years after rescuing P. O. W.s in Vietnam, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is working at a Buddhist monastery in Thailand doing handyman work for the monks and engaging in krabi-krabong matches for money which he donates to the monks. Rambo's old friend and commanding officer Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) visits Rambo and tells him of a CIA backed mission to supply Afghan freedom fighters against Soviet invasion. Rambo turns down the offer. Trautman is soon captured by ruthless Soviet Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) and with no official way to save Trautman, Rambo heads to Afghanistan to save his friend with the help of the Afghan freedom fighters.Following the smash success of Rambo: First Blood Part II, Carolco Pictures announced one year after its release a third film would be produced. Production began with Aussie director Russell Mulcahy of Highlander and Razorback set to direct, but disagreements between star Stallone and Mulcahy eventually resulted in Mulcahy and his Director of Photography getting fired from the production. Peter MacDonald made his film directing debut with Rambo III having previously worked as a second unit director on films such as The Empire Strikes Back, Excalibur, Dragonslayer, and Rambo: First Blood Part II where he served as the helicopter unit director. While initially budgeted at $30 million, production delays and changes resulted in the budget ballooning to an estimated $58-63 million. Upon release the film made only about $53 million in the United States, considerably down from the $150 million earned in the U. S. by its predecessor, but due to the international market the film was able to reach $189 million but was still seen as a disappointment. Rambo III's underperformance is primarily blamed on the thaw of the Cold War tensions between the U. S. and Soviet Union initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev who'd be the final leader of the Soviet Union until he dissolved it into independent states leading to the end of the Cold War in 1991. With the movie's strongly anti-Soviet rhetoric in the face of a cooling political climate, this diminished much of the film's relevance. But production issues and political shifts aside, Rambo is just more of the same high muscle low brain wish fulfillment nonsense as the last film.If you've seen Rambo: First Blood Part II, you've pretty much seen Rambo III with both films being about rescue missions from behind the lines of Soviet/communist controlled fortifications leading to a lot of action excess with explosions and kills galore. There's some minor differences between films such as an annoying kid sideskick or Trautman actually being more integral to the action than in the previous film where he was mostly sidelined, but I will say they've at least jettisoned the Nixon era talking points that protesting Vietnam was the same as protesting the troops so it gets that one bit of leeway. Aside from that however, Rambo III simply exists to be an exercise in orgiastic destruction with explosions every other frame and a climax filled with a battalion of Soviets who can't shoot straight to save their lives that culminates in a game of "chicken" between a tank and a helicopter.Rambo III is pretty much the same film as Rambo: First Blood Part II. There's superficial detail changes and the scenery and locations are new, but everything that was popularized by Rambo, Commando, and the multitude of interchangeable knock-offs inspired by their success is on display here albeit with a ludicrously sized budget which made it the most expensive film at the time (to its credit you can see the money on screen). If you enjoyed Rambo: First Blood Part II you'll enjoy Rambo III just fine, but we're a far cry away from the grit and minimalism of First Blood.

I was wondering going in how "Rambo III" would differ from "Rambo II" besides the location. I didn't expect it to be anything like "First Blood," but why would I like this one if I did?"Rambo III" was based in Afghanistan, which was really relevant in 1988. The Afghans fought the invading Russians from about 1979 to 1989. The U.S. had a rooting interest in that conflict because Russia was our biggest threat on the world stage. "Rambo III" did a fine job in limiting any U.S. rhetoric and focused on the people of Afghanistan and their plight, because after all, they were the ones being slaughtered and displaced, not Americans."Rambo III" made an action movie into a human interest movie in a smooth fluid manner. Yes, Rambo wanted to save his Colonel, but it's clear the movie didn't want to overlook the Afghan people and make it all about Rambo and Colonel Murdock (Charles Napier).Early in the movie Rambo said that his favorite sport was football. Later in the movie we got a football moment when Rambo, in a tank, went head up with the Russian commander who was in a gunship helicopter. They lined up and barreled toward each other like a running back and a linebacker on the goal line. I won't play spoiler, but I will say that that scene was a synopsis of the movie and the entire Cold War. Two powerhouses were lined up going head to head. We now know the winner of that goal line stance, but in 1988 the eventual winner was very uncertain.

Believe me RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART 2 took some swallowing but the opening ten minutes of RAMBO 3 caused me to fall out of my chair in shock . John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune ! I mean that`s a bit like having a film where the hero`s an environmentalist who goes around blowing oil rigs to save the Alaskan wilderness . Oh wait a minute didn`t Steven Seagal ....Despite this incredible and vain attempt at character development there follows much dialogue that accurately reflects what is going on in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s . The Soviet - Afghan war actually intensified when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and by that time over one million Afghans had died in the conflict while as many as five million had been forced over the border into Iran and Pakistan as what analysts at the time called " Migratory genocide " , a euphemism that people nowadays would describe as " Ethnic cleansing " . There`s other parts of the film that points out that screenwriter Sheldon Lettich has done his homework on the conflict with factual things like Soviet conscripts defecting to the Mujahedeen , of the red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and of the Soviets use of chemical weapons which almost certainly proves that the sloppy script of FIRST BLOOD PART 2 was mainly down to James Cameron than Stallone , but as you`d expect in this type of action adventure movie the script rapidly degenerates into a series of set pieces of an all American superman blowing up a bunch of nasty commies who can`t shoot straight . Ah well at least the main commie isn`t played by a British actor unlike in the last film . Oh and congratulations to Peter McDonald for at least trying to make a Puma helicopter look like a Soviet helicopter gunship . The previous director was under the impression that the Soviets and Viet Cong use American Hueys Setting the record straight : A lot of people prove how ignorant they are of the Soviet - Afghan war by confusing the Mujahedeen with the Taliban . The Mujahedeen ( Translated " The soldiers of God " )  and the Taliban ( Translated " The students of God " ) are entirely seperate things . The Taliban were created in Pakistan in the early 1990s , took over Afghanistan in 1995 and were led by Mullah Omar . The Mujahedeen were split into several different groups and were led by different leaders ( None of them called Bin Laden ) most of them forming a coalition against the Taliban called the Northern Alliance in 1995/96 . Their overall leader was the legendary guerilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who was murdered in a suicide bombing by Al Qai`da terrorists in September 2001 . It was the Northern Alliance who fought side by side with the Western coalition during their campaign to overthrow the Taliban government in 2001 to the present day

Rambo III is directed by Peter MacDonald and written by Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich. It stars Stallone, Richard Crenna, Marc de Jong, Kurtwood Smith, Sasson Gabai and Spiros Focas. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by John Stanier. Plot finds John Rambo (Stallone) trying to lead something resembling a normal life in Thailand. But when his only friend in the world, Colonel Sam Trautman (Crenna), is captured and imprisoned by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, Rambo is thrust in to a deadly mission to break his friend out whilst simultaneously helping mujahideen rebels fight Soviet oppression.Lets cut to the chase, Rambo III is an irritant to anyone bothered by its politics and portents, but to the action film fan the rewards are many, very much so. Struggling to break even at the American box office back in 88, clearly the Rambo brand in his own country was wearing thin, but globally? It coined it in. Evidently there were enough action film fans out there lapping it up, and rightly so because Rambo III is a fierce and highly octane piece of cinema.Plot is simplicity, but what stunts, what outrageousness of action construction. Helicopter attacks stir the blood, underground stalk and kills are tense and laced with drama, self surgery is hold your breath time and machismo? Here by the bucket load as Stallone, in magnificent shape, defines once again the Rambo one man army persona. While the wonderful Crenna also gets to kick ass as the finale plays out in a whirl of pyrotechnics and punch the air bravado. It's also a beautifully shot film out of Thailand and Israel, and scored with the usual atomic bluster by Goldsmith.As usual there's not much depth of characterisation on show, though Rambo does come with a bit more humanity this time, and the insertion of a kid side-kick is as pointless as it is twee. Yet as unsubtle as it is, as true to the Rambo formula as you expect, this is one mighty action film and very much recommended to those looking for high energy thrills and much murder death kill. 7/10

Oh my when will Rambo put Viet Nam behind him and move on with his life? He is no longer just a shell shocked veteran but some cold blooded killing mercenary for hire. In this 3rd installment Rambo goes to Afghanistan to kill those bad bad Russians who are so evil killing all those good Afghan mountain people who we would later find ourselves at war with. This film is rotten to the core with endless violence and killing making war look fun with Rambo coming out with hardly a wound. Did the producers ever consider that this was the Soviets Viet Nam? That they lost close to 20,000 men? That some of those men (some 19 years old) would suffer from shell shock the rest of their lives? This film is nothing more than cheap propaganda designed to sell some tickets....

Rambo III is one of my favorite movies of all time. After Rambo rescues the American POWs in Vietnam he moves to Thailand and works in a Buddhist monastary.  He keeps in shape by stick fighting and doing construction work around the monastary.  Sam Trautman and Eric's father from "That '70's Show." Ask Rambo for his help because Trautman is on a mission to deliver Stinger Missiles to the rebels fighting the Soviets.  Trautman later gets caught by the Soviets, and Eric's father tells Rambo at the monastary about Trautman getting captured.  To make a long story short Rambo gets his equipment ready, (detonators and of course BLUE LIGHTS)and heads off to Afghanistan.  It takes awhile for the Afghan Tribes to accept Rambo (they think he's a lost tourist.) The fighting and gun fights are so far-fetched that you gotta love it.  The climax of the film is awesome.  Rambo and Truatman get conered by the Soviets, and Rambo says his famous one liner "F_ck Them!" and starts shoot'n gernades at the soviet army.  With the help of the Afghan Tribesmen, Rambo jumps into a burning Soviet tank and squares off against a evil soviet commander in a attack helicopter.  Rambo kills the soviet commander by shooting the tanks machine gun into the helicopter's cockpit and rams the tank into the helicopter blowing it into millions of pieces! and of course Rambo survives.  I give this movie 7/10

I did'nt expect much from this film before I watched it, then I did and I thought it was great stuff.  It's loaded with action and violence, even more than the first two film's, and the action sequences, I thought, were better in this one than the others.  There are tonnes of gunfights and explosions that make it a lot of fun.  The dialog in RAMBO III pretty (unintentionally) funny, not that thats bad or anything.  My opinions of the RAMBO films has changed quite a bit recently.  I used to think that RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II was the best, but then I realized that FIRST BLOOD is.  I'd have to say that RAMBO III is the second best in the series, followed by the second, though they are all very good film's, not oscar worthy, but still good.Overall, a highly entertaining no-brainer action film that will not disappoint fans of the first two films in the series. 3.5/5

The return of Rambo, the one man army! In this movie he takes on a couple of Soviets, with the help of an Afghan tribe, to save his old pal Colonel Trautman.This is a great enjoyable, very simplistic, straightforward, brutal action-flick. I mean basically all there is to this story is Rambo kicking some Soviet butt. Yes, the movie tries to be more emotional with some of its themes and plot lines but none of this really works out however.When you're bit familiar with the action genre, especially from the '80's than there is no way that you can rate this movie any lower than an 6. This movie is better constructed than, lets say, 80% of any other action movies, especially those made in the '80's, when silly simple, brutal action-flicks were at their prime. And of course this movie also has got something no other action movie has; John J. Rambo. Argualiby the best and most famous action-hero out of cinematic history, portrayed by '80's superstar Sylvester Stallone. For an action movie this is a perfectly constructed, though simple picture, that totally entertains.The movie doesn't begin that good but once it's on steam there is no holding back. Rambo is on fire, from the moment on when he fires his first shot. At first the movie doesn't seem like high-budget stuff but as the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the saved the money for its ending. With its 63 million dollar budget, it actually was the most expensive movie of its time. The second halve of the movie is filled with some spectacular and explosive action. Rambo taking on a helicopter with his bow & arrow and Rambo taking on with a tank the main villain in a helicopter are great action moments, no matter how ridicules it all works for the story and credibility. This movie leaves no question about it; Rambo is an one man army.Granted that of course the movie is only watchable and enjoyable for the action movie fans. Everyone else, who has some common sense, will probably find this movie utterly ridicules.The movie features some beautiful scenery and its obvious that they spared no expenses on the locations. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith also adds to the mood and level of profession of the movie, even though it's mostly recycled work from "Rambo: First Blood Part II".The movie doesn't always flow well and it times it makes the movie feel a bit clumsy. Nevertheless, the movie remains a great genre piece, with all of the typical ingredients, including a great stereotypical mean villain and tough dialog that is surprisingly well written by Sheldon Lettich and Sylvester Stallone himself.An underrated, great simple (like it should be) action movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

This is an american anticommunist propaganda film. As everybody knows USA win wars only in films. Korea, Vietnam and now Afghanistan where big defeats of the USA "superpower" so they have to serve this to their american low education nationalist audience in a more easily digestive manner. Tragically the film is.relevant to the current Afghanistan situation and reminds us how USA gave power to Talibans and made them what they are today. Ancient Greeks had a word about this behaviour of the Americans , it's called "hubris". Check it in google.

Nowadays the chief claim to fame of this little bit of macho 80s tripe is, of course, the events in and regarding Afghanistan since it came out. Even the fact that this was the most expensive movie of all time when it came out--as well as one of the larger financial failures of Stallone's career--has faded from memory.The script must have been written on a cocktail napkin: Rambo gets offered assignment; Rambo turns down assignment; Rambo's friend gets captured by bad guys; Rambo takes the assignment to rescue his friend. Standard issue action movie plot, but in this offering it's fleshed out even less than normal. For instance it's never exactly clear what the assignment IS that's offered by Rambo's former commander and his sniveling CIA sidekick (played with aplomb by Kurtwood Smith, who looks very anxious to get his paycheck and get the haole off this movie) except that it has something to do with Stinger missiles, which are never mentioned again in the picture, violating Anton Checkov's plot rule that a gun seen on the wall of the set in act one must be fired in act three. Every time the talented Richard Crenna is on the screen, another opportunity is blown for even minimal character development--the scriptwriters give him a hackneyed rant to the Russians about "you underestimated your enemy" (sounds like he's talking about Iraq circa 2003) and he spends most of the rest of the film cowering in a cell, waiting to be tortured and/or for Rambo to show up. As Troutman, Crenna never even gets a single line to say how much he misses his wife, or how he'd really like a beer, or how the sniveling CIA man let him down, or something. Yawn.The most shocking thing is that at $63 million this is still very much a B-movie. You'd think at that price, and with exotic shooting locales like Thailand and Israel, at the very least it would look like "David Lean Meets Rambo." In fact it looks like it was filmed on the same dusty Burbank back lot where innumerable Westerns were made in the 1940s. Even the genuine Thailand locations might as well have been EPCOT Center at Disney World.For my money my favorite part of the film is the ludicrous song played over the end credits, which is pure cocktail lounge cornball spiced up with that classic 80s My First Casio synth sound. I hoped against hope when the music credits went by I would see the title of it was "Love Theme from Rambo III," but alas, even this opportunity for a little tongue-in-cheek humor slipped the minds of the filmmakers. But then again, it's Stallone, who didn't learn to take himself with a grain of salt until the Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot era. Perhaps the addition of Estelle Getty with her .357 Magnum might have saved Rambo III from the utter waste of 102 minutes that it is.

Most people – critics and fans alike – are united in their opinion that RAMBO III is the weakest of the original trilogy, but having watched it again after a long while I'm not so sure. In fact, I think all films are equally amazing! RAMBO III is the epitome of the '80s US action film, detailing a larger-than-life battling against overwhelming foreign forces and coming out on top. It equals COMMANDO for pure mind-blowing entertainment, and as a guy's film it doesn't let up. The story begins in somewhat cheesy territory as we witness our hero engaging in a brutal stick fight – the kind of tournament battle popularised in the late '80s by Van Damme in BLOODSPORT. From then on in, the plot evolves pretty much as you'd expect, with the exception that Richard Crenna is the hostage this time around – allowing the seasoned actor to get his teeth into a more developed role than in the previous two films. Good call! From then on in, Rambo makes his way to Afghanistan, where he proceeds to absolutely kick the backsides of the assembled Russian forces there. He joins forces with Afghanistan partisan forces (NOT the Taliban, a common misconception) and stages a stealthy rescue attempt. When that fails, he just loads up and goes on a massive killing spree. It's all good fun, very violent in an '80s way, with a reliance on huge, impressive explosions, and bloody bullet hits as the bad guy soldiers get taken out (but not to pieces – you have to wait until RAMBO (2008) for THAT level of violence). There are also some novelty moments, such as the return of Rambo's bow and exploding arrows, his knife (way bigger than ever before) and a great bit where a bad guy explodes with grenades after getting hanged on the end of a rope – contrived, yes, cheesy, yes, brilliant? Oh YES!Stallone is a mountain of muscle in this, the toughest looking guy I've ever seen in a film – forget Schwarzenegger. The supporting cast do their jobs without ever setting the screen alight, although the main villain is a little weak after Steven Berkoff in the previous flick. Kurtwood Smith IS in the cast, but he's wasted in a little cameo appearance at the beginning instead of acting as a villain a la ROBOCOP. After the initial half an hour set up, this film really doesn't let up and I was surprised at how many elements are re-used in Stallone's fourth film – Rambo using the gun mounted on the jeep, the village attack, the mortars, etc. Anyway, it's all good fun and effortlessly rewatchable. Check it out!

About the only thing this installment has going for it is the action. Unfortunately, even the action is poorly done. A shirtless Rambo cuts through the Soviet war machine like a hot knife through butter. At no point does one get the sense that Rambo is in any real jeopardy even when the Russians fire everything short of an atomic bomb at him. The players are cartoonish caricatures. With an A-Team like endless amount of ammunition, absurdly huge knife, and compound bow Rambo is an American killing machine. A Stallone vanity piece that doesn't really even tie in to the original First Blood in any way. It takes a brutal war in Afganistan that ended up spawning the Taliban and simplifies it to the level of parody.

Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna.If you can find one man who can stop terrorists (Well if you classify Rickman as a terrorist) from doing (What else) blowing up stuff and kidnapping people it would be John J Rambo. This is probably one of the greatest action films ever made, and if you LOVE action. You'll LOVE this magnificent and stunning movie.Rating: I think I would rate this movie 9/10.

Good actors who played their roles perfectly.Interesting to see Sylvester Stallone that I like very much as actor.Now I am curious to see Rambo 4 and the last one part 5. This legendary franchise merits 7/10.

For a movie made so long ago, it's so good! I have seen my fare share of poor movies and this is a much better movie than average! Ok there's no love interest but I didn't even realise until looking through this site! It's so action packed that you won't want to go to the fridge for snacks! Ha! Also a few jokes in this that made me laugh!

I didn't expect it to be anything like "First Blood," but why would I like this one if I did?"Rambo III" was based in Afghanistan, which was really relevant in 1988. The Afghans fought the invading Russians from about 1979 to 1989. The U.S. had a rooting interest in that conflict because Russia was our biggest threat on the world stage. "Rambo III" did a fine job in limiting any U.S. rhetoric and focused on the people of Afghanistan and their plight, because after all, they were the ones being slaughtered and displaced, not Americans."Rambo III" made an action movie into a human interest movie in a smooth fluid manner. Yes, Rambo wanted to save his Colonel, but it's clear the movie didn't want to overlook the Afghan people and make it all about Rambo and Colonel Murdock (Charles Napier).Early in the movie Rambo said that his favorite sport was football. Later in the movie we got a football moment when Rambo, in a tank, went head up with the Russian commander who was in a gunship helicopter. They lined up and barreled toward each other like a running back and a linebacker on the goal line. I won't play spoiler, but I will say that that scene was a synopsis of the movie and the entire Cold War. Two powerhouses were lined up going head to head. We now know the winner of that goal line stance, but in 1988 the eventual winner was very uncertain.

When it came out, I dismissed this film as just another formulaic contrivance for a Hollywood action "hero" to wreak havoc.  But it was much, MUCH worse than I gave it credit for.  After the WTC attack, it now glaringly stands out as the most myopic, propagandistic, ultra-right-wing cinematic drivel of all time.  I only wish that the IMDB user rating system allowed me to register a sub-zero vote.The ultra-conservative Media Research Center took "Big Media" movie critics Richard Schickel of Time and Hal Hinson of The Washington Post to task for having the audacity to ridicule the political message of this film.  Today I salute these critics ... there should have been more like them, willing to challenge the film's ridiculously black-and-white political stance.

Believe me RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART 2 took some swallowing but the opening ten minutes of RAMBO 3 caused me to fall out of my chair in shock . John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune ! I mean that`s a bit like having a film where the hero`s an environmentalist who goes around blowing oil rigs to save the Alaskan wilderness . Oh wait a minute didn`t Steven Seagal ....Despite this incredible and vain attempt at character development there follows much dialogue that accurately reflects what is going on in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s . The Soviet - Afghan war actually intensified when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and by that time over one million Afghans had died in the conflict while as many as five million had been forced over the border into Iran and Pakistan as what analysts at the time called " Migratory genocide " , a euphemism that people nowadays would describe as " Ethnic cleansing " . There`s other parts of the film that points out that screenwriter Sheldon Lettich has done his homework on the conflict with factual things like Soviet conscripts defecting to the Mujahedeen , of the red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and of the Soviets use of chemical weapons which almost certainly proves that the sloppy script of FIRST BLOOD PART 2 was mainly down to James Cameron than Stallone , but as you`d expect in this type of action adventure movie the script rapidly degenerates into a series of set pieces of an all American superman blowing up a bunch of nasty commies who can`t shoot straight . Ah well at least the main commie isn`t played by a British actor unlike in the last film . Oh and congratulations to Peter McDonald for at least trying to make a Puma helicopter look like a Soviet helicopter gunship . The previous director was under the impression that the Soviets and Viet Cong use American Hueys Setting the record straight : A lot of people prove how ignorant they are of the Soviet - Afghan war by confusing the Mujahedeen with the Taliban . The Mujahedeen ( Translated " The soldiers of God " )  and the Taliban ( Translated " The students of God " ) are entirely seperate things . The Taliban were created in Pakistan in the early 1990s , took over Afghanistan in 1995 and were led by Mullah Omar . The Mujahedeen were split into several different groups and were led by different leaders ( None of them called Bin Laden ) most of them forming a coalition against the Taliban called the Northern Alliance in 1995/96 . Their overall leader was the legendary guerilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who was murdered in a suicide bombing by Al Qai`da terrorists in September 2001 . It was the Northern Alliance who fought side by side with the Western coalition during their campaign to overthrow the Taliban government in 2001 to the present day

Take an awful idea. Cast a really bad actor who can't talk. And you have Rambo III. Even the title is wrong. We had 1st Blood and 1st Blood Part 2. So this is First Blood Part 3. NOT Rambo 3. Unless they changed the titles of the previous 2 films and never told anyone.Anyway, now that rant is over lets talk about sex. Well, I wish I could but I've got to review this pile of rubbish 1st.We start by catching up with Rambo in Thailand and he's earning some money taking part in Mu Tai Stick Fighting. So he's a hustler. But he never keeps his winnings, he gives it to the monks because he's living and helping out at a Buddist temple as an odd job man.He's approached by Colonel Trautman and Curtwood Smith to go on a mission to Afghanistan to help some local rebels fight the Russians. He refuses and Trautman goes alone and gets captured which means Rambo decides to go and rescue him all on his own.The Afghan village is attacked by the Russians in helicopters (for seemingly no reason) and they decide to leave and one man decides to help Rambo. Also an annoying young boy who is told in no uncertain terms NOT to come with them.Of course he disobeys and gets them (and himself) injured and Rambo sends his guide and the boy away. Of course he rescues Trautman and some locals also held in the same prison. Steals a helicopter and we're suddenly stealing wholesale from First Blood Part 2. Escaping in a helicopter. Destroying an enemy helicopter and crashing.Then Rambo kills what seems like hundreds of Russian commando's and he and Trautman only have to walk across an empty plain to freedom until half the Russian Army turn up AND an attack helicopter taken again from First Blood Part 2.Of course the Afghans turn up and help Rambo who finally kills the Russian Commander in his helicopter using a tank he captured.Weak film and even weaker ending.

Rambo III is directed by Peter MacDonald and written by Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich. It stars Stallone, Richard Crenna, Marc de Jong, Kurtwood Smith, Sasson Gabai and Spiros Focas. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by John Stanier. Plot finds John Rambo (Stallone) trying to lead something resembling a normal life in Thailand. But when his only friend in the world, Colonel Sam Trautman (Crenna), is captured and imprisoned by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, Rambo is thrust in to a deadly mission to break his friend out whilst simultaneously helping mujahideen rebels fight Soviet oppression.Lets cut to the chase, Rambo III is an irritant to anyone bothered by its politics and portents, but to the action film fan the rewards are many, very much so. Struggling to break even at the American box office back in 88, clearly the Rambo brand in his own country was wearing thin, but globally? It coined it in. Evidently there were enough action film fans out there lapping it up, and rightly so because Rambo III is a fierce and highly octane piece of cinema.Plot is simplicity, but what stunts, what outrageousness of action construction. Helicopter attacks stir the blood, underground stalk and kills are tense and laced with drama, self surgery is hold your breath time and machismo? Here by the bucket load as Stallone, in magnificent shape, defines once again the Rambo one man army persona. While the wonderful Crenna also gets to kick ass as the finale plays out in a whirl of pyrotechnics and punch the air bravado. It's also a beautifully shot film out of Thailand and Israel, and scored with the usual atomic bluster by Goldsmith.As usual there's not much depth of characterisation on show, though Rambo does come with a bit more humanity this time, and the insertion of a kid side-kick is as pointless as it is twee. Yet as unsubtle as it is, as true to the Rambo formula as you expect, this is one mighty action film and very much recommended to those looking for high energy thrills and much murder death kill. 7/10

Oh my when will Rambo put Viet Nam behind him and move on with his life? He is no longer just a shell shocked veteran but some cold blooded killing mercenary for hire. In this 3rd installment Rambo goes to Afghanistan to kill those bad bad Russians who are so evil killing all those good Afghan mountain people who we would later find ourselves at war with. This film is rotten to the core with endless violence and killing making war look fun with Rambo coming out with hardly a wound. Did the producers ever consider that this was the Soviets Viet Nam? That they lost close to 20,000 men? That some of those men (some 19 years old) would suffer from shell shock the rest of their lives? This film is nothing more than cheap propaganda designed to sell some tickets....

Rambo III is one of my favorite movies of all time. After Rambo rescues the American POWs in Vietnam he moves to Thailand and works in a Buddhist monastary.  He keeps in shape by stick fighting and doing construction work around the monastary.  Sam Trautman and Eric's father from "That '70's Show." Ask Rambo for his help because Trautman is on a mission to deliver Stinger Missiles to the rebels fighting the Soviets.  Trautman later gets caught by the Soviets, and Eric's father tells Rambo at the monastary about Trautman getting captured.  To make a long story short Rambo gets his equipment ready, (detonators and of course BLUE LIGHTS)and heads off to Afghanistan.  It takes awhile for the Afghan Tribes to accept Rambo (they think he's a lost tourist.) The fighting and gun fights are so far-fetched that you gotta love it.  The climax of the film is awesome.  Rambo and Truatman get conered by the Soviets, and Rambo says his famous one liner "F_ck Them!" and starts shoot'n gernades at the soviet army.  With the help of the Afghan Tribesmen, Rambo jumps into a burning Soviet tank and squares off against a evil soviet commander in a attack helicopter.  Rambo kills the soviet commander by shooting the tanks machine gun into the helicopter's cockpit and rams the tank into the helicopter blowing it into millions of pieces! and of course Rambo survives.  I give this movie 7/10

I did'nt expect much from this film before I watched it, then I did and I thought it was great stuff.  It's loaded with action and violence, even more than the first two film's, and the action sequences, I thought, were better in this one than the others.  There are tonnes of gunfights and explosions that make it a lot of fun.  The dialog in RAMBO III pretty (unintentionally) funny, not that thats bad or anything.  My opinions of the RAMBO films has changed quite a bit recently.  I used to think that RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II was the best, but then I realized that FIRST BLOOD is.  I'd have to say that RAMBO III is the second best in the series, followed by the second, though they are all very good film's, not oscar worthy, but still good.Overall, a highly entertaining no-brainer action film that will not disappoint fans of the first two films in the series. 3.5/5

The return of Rambo, the one man army! In this movie he takes on a couple of Soviets, with the help of an Afghan tribe, to save his old pal Colonel Trautman.This is a great enjoyable, very simplistic, straightforward, brutal action-flick. I mean basically all there is to this story is Rambo kicking some Soviet butt. Yes, the movie tries to be more emotional with some of its themes and plot lines but none of this really works out however.When you're bit familiar with the action genre, especially from the '80's than there is no way that you can rate this movie any lower than an 6. This movie is better constructed than, lets say, 80% of any other action movies, especially those made in the '80's, when silly simple, brutal action-flicks were at their prime. And of course this movie also has got something no other action movie has; John J. Rambo. Argualiby the best and most famous action-hero out of cinematic history, portrayed by '80's superstar Sylvester Stallone. For an action movie this is a perfectly constructed, though simple picture, that totally entertains.The movie doesn't begin that good but once it's on steam there is no holding back. Rambo is on fire, from the moment on when he fires his first shot. At first the movie doesn't seem like high-budget stuff but as the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the saved the money for its ending. With its 63 million dollar budget, it actually was the most expensive movie of its time. The second halve of the movie is filled with some spectacular and explosive action. Rambo taking on a helicopter with his bow & arrow and Rambo taking on with a tank the main villain in a helicopter are great action moments, no matter how ridicules it all works for the story and credibility. This movie leaves no question about it; Rambo is an one man army.Granted that of course the movie is only watchable and enjoyable for the action movie fans. Everyone else, who has some common sense, will probably find this movie utterly ridicules.The movie features some beautiful scenery and its obvious that they spared no expenses on the locations. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith also adds to the mood and level of profession of the movie, even though it's mostly recycled work from "Rambo: First Blood Part II".The movie doesn't always flow well and it times it makes the movie feel a bit clumsy. Nevertheless, the movie remains a great genre piece, with all of the typical ingredients, including a great stereotypical mean villain and tough dialog that is surprisingly well written by Sheldon Lettich and Sylvester Stallone himself.An underrated, great simple (like it should be) action movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

This is an american anticommunist propaganda film. As everybody knows USA win wars only in films. Korea, Vietnam and now Afghanistan where big defeats of the USA "superpower" so they have to serve this to their american low education nationalist audience in a more easily digestive manner. Tragically the film is.relevant to the current Afghanistan situation and reminds us how USA gave power to Talibans and made them what they are today. Ancient Greeks had a word about this behaviour of the Americans , it's called "hubris". Check it in google.

This flick doesn't deserve even half the hate it gets. Rambo is more jacked than ever; the explosions are bigger and the story is engaging!Just because something is a sequel doesn't mean it doesn't deserve its fair shake. So what if it's a little cheesy? A little cheese is expected with these types of flicks.If you enjoyed the first two Rambo flicks, you'll love this one!

Nowadays the chief claim to fame of this little bit of macho 80s tripe is, of course, the events in and regarding Afghanistan since it came out. Even the fact that this was the most expensive movie of all time when it came out--as well as one of the larger financial failures of Stallone's career--has faded from memory.The script must have been written on a cocktail napkin: Rambo gets offered assignment; Rambo turns down assignment; Rambo's friend gets captured by bad guys; Rambo takes the assignment to rescue his friend. Standard issue action movie plot, but in this offering it's fleshed out even less than normal. For instance it's never exactly clear what the assignment IS that's offered by Rambo's former commander and his sniveling CIA sidekick (played with aplomb by Kurtwood Smith, who looks very anxious to get his paycheck and get the haole off this movie) except that it has something to do with Stinger missiles, which are never mentioned again in the picture, violating Anton Checkov's plot rule that a gun seen on the wall of the set in act one must be fired in act three. Every time the talented Richard Crenna is on the screen, another opportunity is blown for even minimal character development--the scriptwriters give him a hackneyed rant to the Russians about "you underestimated your enemy" (sounds like he's talking about Iraq circa 2003) and he spends most of the rest of the film cowering in a cell, waiting to be tortured and/or for Rambo to show up. As Troutman, Crenna never even gets a single line to say how much he misses his wife, or how he'd really like a beer, or how the sniveling CIA man let him down, or something. Yawn.The most shocking thing is that at $63 million this is still very much a B-movie. You'd think at that price, and with exotic shooting locales like Thailand and Israel, at the very least it would look like "David Lean Meets Rambo." In fact it looks like it was filmed on the same dusty Burbank back lot where innumerable Westerns were made in the 1940s. Even the genuine Thailand locations might as well have been EPCOT Center at Disney World.For my money my favorite part of the film is the ludicrous song played over the end credits, which is pure cocktail lounge cornball spiced up with that classic 80s My First Casio synth sound. I hoped against hope when the music credits went by I would see the title of it was "Love Theme from Rambo III," but alas, even this opportunity for a little tongue-in-cheek humor slipped the minds of the filmmakers. But then again, it's Stallone, who didn't learn to take himself with a grain of salt until the Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot era. Perhaps the addition of Estelle Getty with her .357 Magnum might have saved Rambo III from the utter waste of 102 minutes that it is.

Rambo III. The war won't let go. Vietnam is over and now there is a new time and a new war, and no matter how John wants it, she also takes him to her. There are no big differences from the second film. Only the scenery has changed. Perhaps Rambo himself has changed. In the second film he was more secretive, in the third film he is the real Terminator.

As a character John Rambo was never 100% credible in the first place, but in this movie he has gone completely overboard and become a caricature of himself. The same can be said of Colonel Trautman; Richard Crenna is only the tiniest fraction more realistic than when he parodied his own part in "Hot Shots! Part Deux", and if you're in the mood it's just as funny. On top of it all it's loaded with lame propaganda, and in light of the events of September 11, 2001 the dedication to "the galant people of Afghanistan" is a bit outdated. 3 out 10.

Most people – critics and fans alike – are united in their opinion that RAMBO III is the weakest of the original trilogy, but having watched it again after a long while I'm not so sure. In fact, I think all films are equally amazing! RAMBO III is the epitome of the '80s US action film, detailing a larger-than-life battling against overwhelming foreign forces and coming out on top. It equals COMMANDO for pure mind-blowing entertainment, and as a guy's film it doesn't let up. The story begins in somewhat cheesy territory as we witness our hero engaging in a brutal stick fight – the kind of tournament battle popularised in the late '80s by Van Damme in BLOODSPORT. From then on in, the plot evolves pretty much as you'd expect, with the exception that Richard Crenna is the hostage this time around – allowing the seasoned actor to get his teeth into a more developed role than in the previous two films. Good call! From then on in, Rambo makes his way to Afghanistan, where he proceeds to absolutely kick the backsides of the assembled Russian forces there. He joins forces with Afghanistan partisan forces (NOT the Taliban, a common misconception) and stages a stealthy rescue attempt. When that fails, he just loads up and goes on a massive killing spree. It's all good fun, very violent in an '80s way, with a reliance on huge, impressive explosions, and bloody bullet hits as the bad guy soldiers get taken out (but not to pieces – you have to wait until RAMBO (2008) for THAT level of violence). There are also some novelty moments, such as the return of Rambo's bow and exploding arrows, his knife (way bigger than ever before) and a great bit where a bad guy explodes with grenades after getting hanged on the end of a rope – contrived, yes, cheesy, yes, brilliant? Oh YES!Stallone is a mountain of muscle in this, the toughest looking guy I've ever seen in a film – forget Schwarzenegger. The supporting cast do their jobs without ever setting the screen alight, although the main villain is a little weak after Steven Berkoff in the previous flick. Kurtwood Smith IS in the cast, but he's wasted in a little cameo appearance at the beginning instead of acting as a villain a la ROBOCOP. After the initial half an hour set up, this film really doesn't let up and I was surprised at how many elements are re-used in Stallone's fourth film – Rambo using the gun mounted on the jeep, the village attack, the mortars, etc. Anyway, it's all good fun and effortlessly rewatchable. Check it out!

Third entry directed by Peter MacDonald with lots of frenetic action and plenty of blood and violence . Thrilling and moving Rambo episode in which he goes to Afghanistan to rescue his former Vietnam superior commandant , Colonel Samuel Trautman , Richard Crenna . The famous trilogy was subsequently completed by the recent ¨ John Rambo¨ , a definitive improvement and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand ; nevertheless the best considered is the original . Violent movie with Rambo character who started in ¨First Blood¨ and launched Stallone career going on his successful Rambo episodes . Sylvester Stallone as brawny hero Rambo is top-notch , he was a previous Green Beret , now retired and living a pacific existence in a Buddist temple (itself was a real temple in Thailand undergoing renovation at the time of filming , also many of the Monk extras were in fact real Monks from that very temple who were paid to appear as extras) . We see Rambo's scars from First Blood (the scar on his right arm, caused by the fall through the trees) and Rambo: First Blood Part II (the small scar right above his left cheek, caused by the heated knife scraped by his eye). He has retreated to a easy life in a rural Thai location , taking part a stick fighting match , and in construction site of a Buddhist temple . Here Rambo again has his usual enemies , the Russians , who control a particular sector of Afghanistan battling Afghan rebels , the Mujahideen, who are fighting the Soviets in the Soviet-Afghan War . Rambo goes behind Russian-dominated enemy lines too rescue his former colonel from jail , he had been taken while delivering Stingers ; the problems that the Russian forces faced with American Stinger missiles, as described in this movie, were very real, and accounted for hundreds of Russian helicopters during the real war . As John Rambo joins a warrior named Masoud (Sasson Gabai , whose character is a reference to a real-life leader of the Afghani resistance against the Russian occupation) and a kid to venture behind enemy lines where Trautman (Richard Crenna) was abducted by the ruthless Russian general (Marc De Jonge) . He then frees the prisoner but the cruel General and his soldiers set off in pursuit and carry out a brutal massacre and Rambo leads his pursuers into all kinds of booby snares , puts dangerous traps in the desert and mountains . Rambo appears threatening , lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping the innumerable risks and dangers .From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement ; for that reason the picture is pretty amusing ; furthermore contains lots of explosions and some of the best action scenes ever made , including an impressive machine-gun attack , spectacular scenes with helicopters and impressive ending battle between a tank driven by Rambo and a Mi-24 Hind-A helicopter . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel one army man , however here is no female role in the main cast, and few women appear in the film . With its $63m budget, this was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release . The outdoors are spectaculars , the landscapes have been filmed on location in Bangkok ,Chiang Mai , Buddhist Monestary, Thailand , Tel Aviv , Eilat, Israel ,Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, Yuma, Arizona, USA . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by the cameraman John Stanier . Splendid and rousing musical score by Jerry Goldsmith , series' usual , though composed by means of synthesizer . This nail-biting film was well played and produced by the great Silvester Stallone along with Carolco : Mario Kassar and Andrew G Vajna ; being professionally realized by Peter Donald who subsequently directed another vehicle for Jean Claude Van Damme , Soldier of fortune . Original director Russell Mulcahy was replaced after two weeks of filming due to creative differences and three cinematographers also succeeded .The motion picture was preceded by the original ¨First blood¨ by Ted Kotcheff with Richard Crenna , David Caruso and Brian Dennehy, in which Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully imprisoned and he pulls off the break-out ; Rambo II by George Pan Cosmatos with Martin Kove, Steven Berkoff and Julia Nickson, in which he's forced to go Cambodia in search of American POWs , and this ¨Rambo III¨ with Kurtwood Smith and Spiros Focas , and the ultimate ¨John Rambo¨ directed and starred by Stallone with Julie Benz and Matthew Mardsen . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans . It's a movie for adrenaline lovers and frantic thrillers buffs . Rating : Good, entertaining but violent , two thumbs up . Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this exciting film still has its magnificent moments . This large-scale and lavishly produced pic attempts a peculiar atmosphere with acceptable results . Well worth seeing .

About the only thing this installment has going for it is the action. Unfortunately, even the action is poorly done. A shirtless Rambo cuts through the Soviet war machine like a hot knife through butter. At no point does one get the sense that Rambo is in any real jeopardy even when the Russians fire everything short of an atomic bomb at him. The players are cartoonish caricatures. With an A-Team like endless amount of ammunition, absurdly huge knife, and compound bow Rambo is an American killing machine. A Stallone vanity piece that doesn't really even tie in to the original First Blood in any way. It takes a brutal war in Afganistan that ended up spawning the Taliban and simplifies it to the level of parody.

Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna.If you can find one man who can stop terrorists (Well if you classify Rickman as a terrorist) from doing (What else) blowing up stuff and kidnapping people it would be John J Rambo. This is probably one of the greatest action films ever made, and if you LOVE action. You'll LOVE this magnificent and stunning movie.Rating: I think I would rate this movie 9/10.
