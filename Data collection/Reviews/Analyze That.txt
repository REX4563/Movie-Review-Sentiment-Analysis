Analyse This had a freshness and uniqueness of concept that carried right through the film and made it an enjoyable fluffy comedy. Analyse That falls very adeptly into the stereotype of the sequel that tries to emulate the original and fails miserably. The jokes are the same but somehow less funny, the new characters add nothing notable, Robert DeNiro seemed lost and unsure of his character, Billy Crystal was just plain annoying at times and the story was alternately ridiculous and pedantic. Are we really supposed to be curious about whether or not he's going straight? And in the end, did he? 6 is actually a bit generous, consider it a 5.5 rounded up.But that's just my two scents. ;)

Analyze This had an element of novelty and a generous dose of humor. Lacking the novelty due to its sequelhood, Analyze That tries to compensate by making forays into the psyche of Dr. Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal) as well as a little more (very little) analysis of mobster Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro). The psychology angle is not given much time or emphasis, but I suppose director Harold Ramis should get a couple of points for making a token effort.The film is pretty funny and worth seeing, but doesn't really offer us anything new.  This is forgivable, though, because Crystal and De Niro are entertaining enough to carry the picture.  Overall, I'd recommend it -- it's funny and watchable and the two leads are very good.

Analyze That is the sequel to Analyze This and again re-unites Robert DiNero and Billy Crystal. The story picks up right where Analyze This left off. Paul Vitti is in jail and when unknown people try and kill him, he realizes he must get out and get to those responsible for the attempts in murdering him, before they get to him. He fakes an illness and gets released into his former shrink, Ben Sobel's, care.I enjoyed the first one. I thought it had a a few funny moments, great acting, and I just overall enjoyed it. I didn't see the point in a sequel. However, I also enjoyed this one. It wasn't as good as the first, by no means. But it was still alright.Once again, it had funny moments and great acting, but I didn't buy into the premise, and some of the dialog was a bit hammy. However, I enjoyed it and, if you watch one, you might as well watch the other. A solid 6/10

The rise of the producing team of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, Flashdance and sundry other subtle works exploring the deepest secrets of the human heart) in the 1980s introduced the High Concept movie - one whose premise and entire raison d'être could be summed up in a single sentence, preferably referring to other hit movies  for example Days of Thunder was `Top Gun with cars.' 1999's Analyse This may have been a High Concept movie  Mafia Don Sees Shrink With Hilarious Results  but it had a lightness of touch that made it seem less like a focus-group product and more like an offbeat little comedy. Unfortunately for Analyse That, the success of The Sopranos has made Mafioso-psychiatrist relations almost as much a cliché as two cops, one steady and by the book and the other an impulsive maverick, who initially hate each other but bond over the course of several gun battles. More fundamentally, the concept of Analyse This hasn't been taken any further. There could be some entertainment to be had when Robert de Niro's character takes a job as an advisor on `Little Caesar', a Mafia-themed TV drama, but the main joke is that the actor playing the Don is an Australian. It struck me that both actors who played Don Corleone in The Godfather series have now taken the mickey out of the mafia  Brando in The Freshman and now de Niro in the Analyse This and That series (if there's a sequel, what will it be called? Analyse The Other?)
Lisa Kudrow is grossly underused  one gets the feeling that much of her part ended up on the cutting room floor. Both Crystal and de Niro are pretty good (this is called `damning with faint praise' in the trade, if you're wondering) There are some pleasing shots of New York, and David Holmes' soundtrack has its moments (although is nothing to his work for Ocean's Eleven or Out of Sight) Analyse That is not a bad film, just a rather forgettable one. Puts the `sleep' into `sleeps with the fishes.'

I wasn't laughing as much as I did in the first movie. But there are some pretty funny scenes in "Analyze That". I think I am in love with Robert DeNiro. It's official. :D Just kidding. He's just so funny in the movie. Once again he steals the show. Especially with him singing songs from "West Side Story". The plot isn't as interesting as the fist movie of course, but they keep up with the same goofs. Over all, it's a good film. But don't expect another "Analyze This". It's not as funny. But it's good for a couple laughs.And since I am so in love with Robert, I'm going to be nice.7/10

As sequels go, this was above average. Which translates into a so-so+ movie. I gave it a 7 out of 10, instead of a 5 or a 6, because there ARE some great laughs in it. Although it pains me to say it, overall, as a movie, "Analyze That" was a bit flaccid, a bit pale, and certainly not as good as the original. It seemed tired and faded, somehow--- kind of like the recent "Men in Black II" sequel to MIB. However, if you are a Billy Crystal-hitting-old-age fan, and if you are a Robert DiNiro fan (and who isn't???--- and if you are gracious enough to be willing to be entertained for a couple of hours, go see it. You'll probably have a pleasant evening!

I don't usually write reviews, but I remember watching this stinker, and wanted to throw in my two cents.This film is about Paul Vitti pretending to be insane to get out of jail, thereby driving his psychiatrist insane. How idiotic a premise is that? "Analyze This" was a good film. But "Analyze That" is bad. The plot is empty and chaotic. Apart from the beginning few scenes, there is almost nothing related to madness. The film tries so hard to be funny, by doing the exact opposite of "Analyze This". This time round, the psychiatrist gets crazy and the mobster has to cheer him up. And it is Ben who bugs Paul all the time. I feel that they try too hard to be funny. The end result is that the film ends up not being funny, and sometimes becomes just plain silly. "Analyze That" is a disappointing sequel. Don't waste your time on this.

Sequels rarely live up to the original, and this is no exception. It has its moments, as well as some laughs, but the original was better and funnier. I sort of liked it, but as I said...
You might like it if you liked the original.

Another sequel on the market, another disappointment. It is not something totally new, but the fact that De Niro keeps playing in such movies is quite sad. I don't think he is really made for comedies, and if he is, then for no more than one. His type of character is quite clear and I wonder now how another sequel, to a good comedy, "Meet the Fockers" will be like. I sincerely doubt it will be good. SpoilersThe story is quite predictable...There is De Niro, a mobster (the one we know from the first film- Paul Vitti) who has to spend some time behind bars...but it so happens that he escapes with the help of his doctor, Ben Sobol( Billy Cristal), and exactly as in the first movie he gives him a very hard time. And so the story starts...The movie hasn't got an interesting plot, but it should've had many funny moments. Unfortunately these were quite missing, not totally, but I didn't laugh as much as I should've. The humor is dry, and not funny. The only question really was, how much they could squeeze out of all the mafia parodies. The answer: not much. The actors lost their charm too, and neither De Niro, nor' Crystal gave the movie an exciting tempo. It was slow, despite lasting around one hour and a half, and the rest of the characters where poorly modeled on the screen. There were much to few interesting moments in this film.
If you want to see a good parody about the mafia, I would recommend "Mickey Blue Eyes", which I personally enjoyed very much! Or you could watch the first part to this sequel if you haven't seen it, because it is definitely better. Or if you want a comedy with De Niro just watch "Meet the Parents". All of these movies have more charm than this one. a cold 5.5/10

This sequel of the 1999 mob comedy "Analyze This" has plenty to keep the viewers laughing, bemused, and sometimes shocked. It's no longer a tale of a sweet psychiatrist keeping a mafia don sober. On the contrary, it's the gangster who's showing his shrink the reality of the tough side to every human soul. Guess who's expected to be lying on the psychiatric couch? Yep, this film offers a fun ride to the psychology of the shrink! And it makes no apologies for pumping up enough guffaws to keep one's throat sore. It may not be the comedy for the puritanical grandmas and grand-papas, but face it, it's gangland - foul-mouthed, and rude gestures, vulgarities, et. al. Yep, Director Harold Ramis can't be accused of not injecting new flavor and spice to this sequel's characters! Nope, there's no way one can complain that it has the same old jokes. De Niro and Billy Crystal, and a cast of amusing actors are offering a new outlook on mob life and it's influence. There are demons lurking in every mind; there is the identity crisis to consider - even with the good, old professional folks.

Analyze That was a big disappointment. A potentially very funny film with a good, well-tried storyline and a good cast was spoilt by some very overdone, very silly, and very juvenile vulgarity. Crudity is only funny if it is cleverly ironic or satiric and parodying, Analyze That is none of these. The whole film seemed to revolve around how many times those actors playing assorted criminal slags could spit out the f-word in the dialogue of a scene, which is plainly pathetic as a device for comedy. The director, Harold Ramis, who has been a good comedic actor and a clever writer for other films, should go back and rethink his whole recent approach to comedy if this movie is any indication. And what is the point of having a resource such as De Niro if you can't use him better than this, or did he decide not to try too hard for this one. This film was just painful to watch. Analyze That is not worth the price of admission for this viewer.

"Analyze That" is proof the critics can be wrong. Which probably means you shouldn't be listening to me, either. But you are, oh well. I guess I'll have to review the movie, now.The Boss and The Shrink are back in therapy: Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) has been locked up in Sing-Sing for 850 days. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) has just lost his father. That's when he gets the call from Vitti. Vitti gives him the low-down: Someone is trying to kill Vitti in jail. Sobel hangs up, Vitti gets mad, so he fakes crazy, and Sobel gets called in (since he is Vitti's psychiatrist). Sobel believes Vitti is cuckoo in the slammer, as he sees him singing tunes from "West Side Story" (one of the funniest parts in the film). So Vitti is released into the custody of Ben Sobel. But on the ride to Sobel's house, Vitti snaps out of it, only to reveal that he is not crazy, but, in fact, quite well. Now Vitti must start a new life and get a real job - that involves working "from 9 to 5!" - and find out who is trying to kill him...and why.Perhaps I am mistaken, but "Analyze That" is funnier than "Analyze This." Maybe it's just me, but I found it quite funny. I didn't think it was a "rip-off" sequel, there for "no artistic reason." Sure, it's a sequel. Of course it's not going to be an Oscar-winner for originality; I don't ask for that in a comedy. Honestly, can you think of any sequel (other than the rare "Godfather Part II" film) that is as good as the original in terms of reasons for being there? All I know is that I think "Analyze That" had some very funny moments. Take, for instance, the scenes where Vitti is trying to get a new job. He becomes a car salesman for a day, and leads around a couple, showing them a nice car. "Look at that trunk - you could fit three bodies in there!" he says. When they say they're going to think about it: "What's there to think about? You've been busting my b@lls for the last hour over this thing, asking me all these stupid questions, taking it for a test drive...so why don't you buy it?"Scenes like these are hilarious. And while there are somewhat long sequences without any laughs, the laugh-out-loud scenes more than make up for those lacking.The only thing about this film that makes me drop the rating a notch is the execution of the last half hour. Just like the first movie, they set up a ridiculous "action" ending, that isn't action at all. Its ending is overlong and goes way too long without any laughs.But that is the only thing I didn't like about the movie. De Niro and Crystal have a real chemistry, even more so here than in the first film. De Niro steals the scenes he is in, and Crystal steals the scenes he is in, and when they are both on screen, you're not sure who to look at.I find Robert De Niro's latest journeys into comedy quite funny. He made a few comedies here and there in the past, but in the last three years he's coughed out some funny movies. "Analyze This," "Meet the Parents," "Analyze That," and to a certain degree (it was okay), "Showtime."Perhaps I am confused. Maybe I need to see the first again. But having seen the original about twice, and "Analyze That" once, I can honestly say that I laughed more in "Analyze That" than I did watching "Analyze This." And if that's not a good sequel, I don't know what is.Here's to "Analyze This, That, and the Other Thing"!3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer

I was a big fan of Analyze this. That is why I was really disappointed with Analyze that, a film that could've been a lot better. Trust me, it's not as bad as Be Coll or anything. I was a big fan of Get shorty and I was disappointed with that movie's sequel also. Trust me, this ain't Be cool though. Years after he was put away, Paul Vitti comes out of Sing Sing prison, where he sang sang. He comes back to his therapist Ben Sobel(played by the great Billy Crystal), where he causes even more chaos than before. I loved the original film, but this film has a Whole ten yards thing going with it where it's just a little silly. I give both films(Analyze that and The Whole ten yards) the same rating though. Does this film come close to being as good as the original? No. But the film still works in some sort of way. I'll agree that it was a disappointment, but I still liked it.Analyze that:***/****

I went to see this movie with my friend Paulina when it first came out ... I really liked it's prequel ANALYZE THIS. I was expecting to laugh and be happy with it ... not wowed, but glad that i'd seen it. After about the first 20 minutes of me wrinkling my brow out of confusion to when it was going to get "good" I started to actually talk to my friend, which i never do during a movie, asking her if she liked it and asking her if her laughter was for real. This movie was an embarrassment for Robert Di Niro and Billy Crystal who have proved themselves over and over again. I felt like... why? WHY? Would they be so NOT picky in the material that they would choose? Why would they waste their time and talent on this piece of crap? She kept laughing and telling me she really liked it! I wish that I could erase the memory so I could go on loving Robert Di Niro and respecting him at the same time. I was also forced to look at Paulina in this awful light. How could I listen to anything she has to say if I couldn't understand how she could like such a mockery. I shortly after the movie started to be mean to her involuntarily because of this. A week later I never spoke to her again!

Sequel is mostly not a reputable thing in Hollywood. In one week, I was reviewing sequels to memorable comedies like (Arthur 2: On the Rocks - 1988), (The Odd Couple II - 1998), and now (Analyze That - 2002) to have a bad result all the way. I think the commercial exploitation reached its explosion at the 2000s. Away from that, just look at this example: Director (Brad Bird) after the smash success of his Oscar-winner (The Incredibles - 2004) refuses to make any sequel, prequel, spin-off and dedicates himself to make totally another movie, another Oscar-winner (Ratatouille - 2007). This is wise creative person with bold decisions to make.Unlike Mr. Bird, here, after the genius simple (Analyze This), they produced (Analyze That)! First off, the concept of this (That) was weak. I mean it could have been prettier idea to see some reversal as the mob man treats the doctor this time, or something like that. But unfortunately what we've seen was muddled, semi-pointless, and less funny compared to the first one.Basically the situations were on shaky ground. The credibility, which was smartly coherent in the first (Analyze), is lost. And to hide that, they made all the possible comic lines they could do, however none was well enough, and they showered the movie with really nasty jokes, which ended up as just nasty! The best of this movie remains its first half, where (De Niro) is a mad singing man, or undesirable guest, or failing at many jobs. As the second half was the best of perturbation; the wholly unfunny matter of the TV show (strange how they missed to produce any laughs out of it), some car chase, a sudden unbelievable heist, and one genuine fabricated happy end where (De Niro) must look as the criminal with the heart of gold, and everything finishes fine.(De Niro) became finally Mr. Hollywood; who's making the obligatory empty sequel. What a pity to hire a great comedian like him; who didn't have the chance much to express his talent at that area, merely to be in a nice sketch or two. I'm sorry to say it, but (Billy Crystal) makes outrageously his Razzie-worthy role and movie. If you looked closer you'd find that the script gave him nothing to do, so he had to manage with what appeared as his most ridiculous performance yet. (Harold Ramis) turns to remakes (Bedazzled - 2000), and sequels (Analyze That - 2002) after years of his "original" masterpiece as a writer, producer, and director (Groundhog Day - 1993). It's nearly the perfect case for what Hollywood does with its people at the insolvent boring 2000s!This movie is in disarray that makes it look poor. And after the success of the previous one, it's disappointing. What can I say? The absurd plot, the hasty dealing, and the easy dirty gags did it. The only good thing to be said about those couple of movies is that they're way better, and more watchable, than (De Niro)'s other candy bars of the same time: (Meet the Parents - 2000) and (Meet the Fockers - 2004) which were horrible.More often than not, the shadows of good movies, which they call sequels, can shadow effectively.

They are back, and Ben Sobel (Crystal) got more issues to deal with his patient who happens to be a Mob leader: Paul Vitti (De Niro). So folks Robert De Niro again with Billy Crystal, it turned out more fun then i expected, and I am hard to impress when it comes to sequels. Sequels often ruins the whole part of movie loving, in fact i couldn't imagine a sequel of ...on the top of my head "The Shawshank redemption" that would really make me angry. Anyway i could in no way say that this one is better than the first one, in fact it would be better if they just stopped after the first one, but actually this one was really funny (for a sequel), so it still gets 6/10 which is probably the highest vote for a sequel given by me...

I found this sequel to be as good if not better than the original (here's one thing it might have with the godfather series, aside from 'stealing' one of the scores for 10 seconds, teehee). It seemed as if the satirical elements in the film were handled more poignantly but at the same time, more light-heartedly than 'Analyze This'. The clashes of cultures, of personalities, inter-mob conflict & the FBI (FBI Agent's best line: "Just call the FBI's limousine service at 1-800-F**-Off", teeheehee) all work themselves-in pretty well here, the scenes are quite balanced with few excesses (i.e. overdoing some jokes to death). Some jokes/exploits are repeated a bunch of times, but they tend to be employed tactfully (i.e. I didn't feel embarrassed for the actors) and humorously (i.e. I laughed, I giggled). I confess I thought that this movie was not going to end up being up to par. I am pleased to be proven incorrect on that front. A good comedy and perhaps the best mob comedy (clearly one of the best).
In closing, amusing and well-worth the time if one is seeking some good laughs. Of course, that depends one one's sense of humor (people do die violently in this comedy) : but I suspect that most people going to see this one would already know more-or-less what to expect, and in this sense, I think they will be pleasantly surprised. I was.7.5/10

I saw "Analyze This" when it came on video some years ago and I liked it, it wasn´t exactly a laugh-out-loud comedy, but funny enough. One of its strong points was its cast: Robert DeNiro was perfect and Billy Crystal knows how to do comedy. Since then I have seen the film a few times on TV and I wouldn´t mind watching it once more. I can´t say the same about "Analyze That", though. The film is a real let-down and worth not missing."Analyze That" has everything expect for jokes that really work. The cast is without doubt full of rock-solid talents and everybody gives a good performance. I´ve always considered Lisa Kudrow my favorite of the Friends and in this film she has been given a few amusing lines. But where can you go with a script that simply isn´t funny? I was very disappointed in this film, you should get more from such a movie as "Analyze That".I guess "Analyze That" is just another sequel made because of the success of the first part. Too bad most of the sequels are made just because of money and no one cares about the script (another example: "MIIB"). Hopefully the poor box-office performance shows that "Analyze This & That Too" isn´t on the list of most-wanted movies.

"Analyze That", the first sequel to "Analyze This" is just more of the same. Of course, if you liked the original, that would be a good thing. If not...not.  Crystal continues as the reluctant shrink while DeNiro continues a the mob boss with issues in this madcap attempt to capitalize on the success of "...This" by punching up "...That" with strippers, car chases, stunts, shootouts, etc. Enjoyable but, like most sequels, lacking the freshness of the original. (B-)

I think I might have chuckled a couple of times.  A pretty tame film that tries to draw laughs from getting the straight laced Ben Sobel  (Billy Crystal) mixed up in the "Mobs" business as he seems to be trying to help someone, that he also knows doesn't need the help.  The situations were ridiculous, and unrealistic, which would be ok if it were a hilarious "screw-ball" comedy, but it falls way short on the comedy.

This is the sequel to Analyze this from 99. This movie is pretty darn good I thought can stand on it's own without the original,, Billy Cryystal and Robert DeNiro are back of course, some of the other characters are different, but the storyline goes like this,, Paul Vitti is in Sing , Sing prison in New York,, and other mob Families decides that it's time for Paul to sing his swan song,, preferably in the East River.. but Paul has other ideas, he fakes being insane, so he can get released into his pyschiatrist's care,, Dr. Sobel, and from there this is where it get's interesting,, he comes back to the dr's house and has to stay with them , and get a real you know,, job type job.. well after a few jobs he lands one, but slowly slips back into the Mafia persona, their he cuts a deal with one mob family to get the other one off his back, then a hit occurs on him, and he has to figure out which family ordered the hit.. very good movie,, lot's of good funny Mafia stuff in here.

"Analyze That" is a sequel to the 1999 film "Analyze This" that rather misses the reason why that latter film was enjoyable."Analyze This" was a movie that worked fairly well as an amusing comedy because of the chemistry between Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Their relationship was the heart of the picture, and the audience gravitated towards it.De Niro and Crystal are no worse here, but the script makes the mistake of not focusing on them enough. Instead, the majority of the film follows De Niro and his plans to get back into the "business." This persists until the final act, which turns into the most cliched mafia picture you've ever seen, nearly devoid of humor all together.All of this considered, however, the movie does feature some scenes between De Niro and Crystal, and when their doing their thing and bantering with each other, it's just as funny as the first film. That being said, I simply wish there was more of it."Analyze That" is not a terrible film, it's simply a mediocre and forgettable one that doesn't reach even the simple enjoyability of its predecessor.

All the revues said this was just o.k. but I have to tell you different. This film had me in stitches from the start. I am amazed how Robert DeNiro can be so strong in serious roles and yet he does comedy as good as any one. People like Robin Williams are trying to cross over to serious roles as is Jim Carrey and this guy makes it look like anybody could do it. Unreal !! Two thumbs way up for this one.

A sequel to the enjoyable Analyze This, 'Analyze That' is a partly funny sequel, that never achieves the wit & energy of its prequel, but works in its own way nonetheless. Despite a few shortcomings, there are some genuine laughs to be had here!'Analyze That' Synopsis: Mobster Paul Vitti is released into Dr. Ben Sobol's care, where only more chaos ensues.'Analyze That' has a strong first-hour, where the humor works. But, the second-hour slips into predictability & is low on laughs. In short, a lively first-hour is its high, but an underwhelming second-hour is its low!Kenneth Lonergan, Peter Tolan, Peter Steinfeld & Harold Ramis's Screenplay works in bits & pieces. One certainly is missing the wit of its much superior prequel. Ramis's Direction is decent, as always. Ramis knew his job & his loss makes his work all the more precious. Performance-Wise: Robert De Niro & Billy Crystal reprise their parts, most admirably. De Niro is simply brilliant as the don with a soft heart, while Crystal is responsible for the film's best laughs. Joe Viterelli, in his final role. is excellent. Lisa Kudrow is lovely in a small, but significant role.On the whole, 'Analyze That' isn't all-out funny, but it succeeds in making you laugh at parts.

Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) is attending his hated father's funeral with wife Laura (Lisa Kudrow) when he gets a call from Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) in prison. Ben is brought in to treat Paul. Apparently, Paul has gone temporarily insane after a few assassination attempts. The authority releases him into Ben's care. Of course, Paul is faking it and the cops are not actually buying it. They released him to get at the warring mob families. Jelly is back to serve Paul who suspects mob black widow Patti LoPresti (Cathy Moriarty).The premise is unrealistic at best. Even if the cops are in on the release, it's crazy that Ben would not run away screaming. The premise is bad and it goes down an even worst avenue as Paul tries to find a job. It's stupid. I can think of a myriad of different paths to go with a sequel. This is not one of them. Ben could have gone to prison for something and this could be a prison movie. Paul could escape and take Ben hostage. This movie is bad concept from the start and none of it is funny. I'm not a big fan of the first movie. I do like Niro and Crystal as performers but it's sad to see them in this.

Analyse This had a freshness and uniqueness of concept that carried right through the film and made it an enjoyable fluffy comedy. Analyse That falls very adeptly into the stereotype of the sequel that tries to emulate the original and fails miserably. The jokes are the same but somehow less funny, the new characters add nothing notable, Robert DeNiro seemed lost and unsure of his character, Billy Crystal was just plain annoying at times and the story was alternately ridiculous and pedantic. Are we really supposed to be curious about whether or not he's going straight? And in the end, did he? 6 is actually a bit generous, consider it a 5.5 rounded up.But that's just my two scents. ;)

Analyze This had an element of novelty and a generous dose of humor. Lacking the novelty due to its sequelhood, Analyze That tries to compensate by making forays into the psyche of Dr. Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal) as well as a little more (very little) analysis of mobster Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro). The psychology angle is not given much time or emphasis, but I suppose director Harold Ramis should get a couple of points for making a token effort.The film is pretty funny and worth seeing, but doesn't really offer us anything new.  This is forgivable, though, because Crystal and De Niro are entertaining enough to carry the picture.  Overall, I'd recommend it -- it's funny and watchable and the two leads are very good.

Analyze That is the sequel to Analyze This and again re-unites Robert DiNero and Billy Crystal. The story picks up right where Analyze This left off. Paul Vitti is in jail and when unknown people try and kill him, he realizes he must get out and get to those responsible for the attempts in murdering him, before they get to him. He fakes an illness and gets released into his former shrink, Ben Sobel's, care.I enjoyed the first one. I thought it had a a few funny moments, great acting, and I just overall enjoyed it. I didn't see the point in a sequel. However, I also enjoyed this one. It wasn't as good as the first, by no means. But it was still alright.Once again, it had funny moments and great acting, but I didn't buy into the premise, and some of the dialog was a bit hammy. However, I enjoyed it and, if you watch one, you might as well watch the other. A solid 6/10

The rise of the producing team of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, Flashdance and sundry other subtle works exploring the deepest secrets of the human heart) in the 1980s introduced the High Concept movie - one whose premise and entire raison d'être could be summed up in a single sentence, preferably referring to other hit movies  for example Days of Thunder was `Top Gun with cars.' 1999's Analyse This may have been a High Concept movie  Mafia Don Sees Shrink With Hilarious Results  but it had a lightness of touch that made it seem less like a focus-group product and more like an offbeat little comedy. Unfortunately for Analyse That, the success of The Sopranos has made Mafioso-psychiatrist relations almost as much a cliché as two cops, one steady and by the book and the other an impulsive maverick, who initially hate each other but bond over the course of several gun battles. More fundamentally, the concept of Analyse This hasn't been taken any further. There could be some entertainment to be had when Robert de Niro's character takes a job as an advisor on `Little Caesar', a Mafia-themed TV drama, but the main joke is that the actor playing the Don is an Australian. It struck me that both actors who played Don Corleone in The Godfather series have now taken the mickey out of the mafia  Brando in The Freshman and now de Niro in the Analyse This and That series (if there's a sequel, what will it be called? Analyse The Other?)
Lisa Kudrow is grossly underused  one gets the feeling that much of her part ended up on the cutting room floor. Both Crystal and de Niro are pretty good (this is called `damning with faint praise' in the trade, if you're wondering) There are some pleasing shots of New York, and David Holmes' soundtrack has its moments (although is nothing to his work for Ocean's Eleven or Out of Sight) Analyse That is not a bad film, just a rather forgettable one. Puts the `sleep' into `sleeps with the fishes.'

I wasn't laughing as much as I did in the first movie. But there are some pretty funny scenes in "Analyze That". I think I am in love with Robert DeNiro. It's official. :D Just kidding. He's just so funny in the movie. Once again he steals the show. Especially with him singing songs from "West Side Story". The plot isn't as interesting as the fist movie of course, but they keep up with the same goofs. Over all, it's a good film. But don't expect another "Analyze This". It's not as funny. But it's good for a couple laughs.And since I am so in love with Robert, I'm going to be nice.7/10

As sequels go, this was above average. Which translates into a so-so+ movie. I gave it a 7 out of 10, instead of a 5 or a 6, because there ARE some great laughs in it. Although it pains me to say it, overall, as a movie, "Analyze That" was a bit flaccid, a bit pale, and certainly not as good as the original. It seemed tired and faded, somehow--- kind of like the recent "Men in Black II" sequel to MIB. However, if you are a Billy Crystal-hitting-old-age fan, and if you are a Robert DiNiro fan (and who isn't???--- and if you are gracious enough to be willing to be entertained for a couple of hours, go see it. You'll probably have a pleasant evening!

I don't usually write reviews, but I remember watching this stinker, and wanted to throw in my two cents.This film is about Paul Vitti pretending to be insane to get out of jail, thereby driving his psychiatrist insane. How idiotic a premise is that? "Analyze This" was a good film. But "Analyze That" is bad. The plot is empty and chaotic. Apart from the beginning few scenes, there is almost nothing related to madness. The film tries so hard to be funny, by doing the exact opposite of "Analyze This". This time round, the psychiatrist gets crazy and the mobster has to cheer him up. And it is Ben who bugs Paul all the time. I feel that they try too hard to be funny. The end result is that the film ends up not being funny, and sometimes becomes just plain silly. "Analyze That" is a disappointing sequel. Don't waste your time on this.

Sequels rarely live up to the original, and this is no exception. It has its moments, as well as some laughs, but the original was better and funnier. I sort of liked it, but as I said...
You might like it if you liked the original.

Another sequel on the market, another disappointment. It is not something totally new, but the fact that De Niro keeps playing in such movies is quite sad. I don't think he is really made for comedies, and if he is, then for no more than one. His type of character is quite clear and I wonder now how another sequel, to a good comedy, "Meet the Fockers" will be like. I sincerely doubt it will be good. SpoilersThe story is quite predictable...There is De Niro, a mobster (the one we know from the first film- Paul Vitti) who has to spend some time behind bars...but it so happens that he escapes with the help of his doctor, Ben Sobol( Billy Cristal), and exactly as in the first movie he gives him a very hard time. And so the story starts...The movie hasn't got an interesting plot, but it should've had many funny moments. Unfortunately these were quite missing, not totally, but I didn't laugh as much as I should've. The humor is dry, and not funny. The only question really was, how much they could squeeze out of all the mafia parodies. The answer: not much. The actors lost their charm too, and neither De Niro, nor' Crystal gave the movie an exciting tempo. It was slow, despite lasting around one hour and a half, and the rest of the characters where poorly modeled on the screen. There were much to few interesting moments in this film.
If you want to see a good parody about the mafia, I would recommend "Mickey Blue Eyes", which I personally enjoyed very much! Or you could watch the first part to this sequel if you haven't seen it, because it is definitely better. Or if you want a comedy with De Niro just watch "Meet the Parents". All of these movies have more charm than this one. a cold 5.5/10

This sequel of the 1999 mob comedy "Analyze This" has plenty to keep the viewers laughing, bemused, and sometimes shocked. It's no longer a tale of a sweet psychiatrist keeping a mafia don sober. On the contrary, it's the gangster who's showing his shrink the reality of the tough side to every human soul. Guess who's expected to be lying on the psychiatric couch? Yep, this film offers a fun ride to the psychology of the shrink! And it makes no apologies for pumping up enough guffaws to keep one's throat sore. It may not be the comedy for the puritanical grandmas and grand-papas, but face it, it's gangland - foul-mouthed, and rude gestures, vulgarities, et. al. Yep, Director Harold Ramis can't be accused of not injecting new flavor and spice to this sequel's characters! Nope, there's no way one can complain that it has the same old jokes. De Niro and Billy Crystal, and a cast of amusing actors are offering a new outlook on mob life and it's influence. There are demons lurking in every mind; there is the identity crisis to consider - even with the good, old professional folks.

Analyze That was a big disappointment. A potentially very funny film with a good, well-tried storyline and a good cast was spoilt by some very overdone, very silly, and very juvenile vulgarity. Crudity is only funny if it is cleverly ironic or satiric and parodying, Analyze That is none of these. The whole film seemed to revolve around how many times those actors playing assorted criminal slags could spit out the f-word in the dialogue of a scene, which is plainly pathetic as a device for comedy. The director, Harold Ramis, who has been a good comedic actor and a clever writer for other films, should go back and rethink his whole recent approach to comedy if this movie is any indication. And what is the point of having a resource such as De Niro if you can't use him better than this, or did he decide not to try too hard for this one. This film was just painful to watch. Analyze That is not worth the price of admission for this viewer.

"Analyze That" is proof the critics can be wrong. Which probably means you shouldn't be listening to me, either. But you are, oh well. I guess I'll have to review the movie, now.The Boss and The Shrink are back in therapy: Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) has been locked up in Sing-Sing for 850 days. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) has just lost his father. That's when he gets the call from Vitti. Vitti gives him the low-down: Someone is trying to kill Vitti in jail. Sobel hangs up, Vitti gets mad, so he fakes crazy, and Sobel gets called in (since he is Vitti's psychiatrist). Sobel believes Vitti is cuckoo in the slammer, as he sees him singing tunes from "West Side Story" (one of the funniest parts in the film). So Vitti is released into the custody of Ben Sobel. But on the ride to Sobel's house, Vitti snaps out of it, only to reveal that he is not crazy, but, in fact, quite well. Now Vitti must start a new life and get a real job - that involves working "from 9 to 5!" - and find out who is trying to kill him...and why.Perhaps I am mistaken, but "Analyze That" is funnier than "Analyze This." Maybe it's just me, but I found it quite funny. I didn't think it was a "rip-off" sequel, there for "no artistic reason." Sure, it's a sequel. Of course it's not going to be an Oscar-winner for originality; I don't ask for that in a comedy. Honestly, can you think of any sequel (other than the rare "Godfather Part II" film) that is as good as the original in terms of reasons for being there? All I know is that I think "Analyze That" had some very funny moments. Take, for instance, the scenes where Vitti is trying to get a new job. He becomes a car salesman for a day, and leads around a couple, showing them a nice car. "Look at that trunk - you could fit three bodies in there!" he says. When they say they're going to think about it: "What's there to think about? You've been busting my b@lls for the last hour over this thing, asking me all these stupid questions, taking it for a test drive...so why don't you buy it?"Scenes like these are hilarious. And while there are somewhat long sequences without any laughs, the laugh-out-loud scenes more than make up for those lacking.The only thing about this film that makes me drop the rating a notch is the execution of the last half hour. Just like the first movie, they set up a ridiculous "action" ending, that isn't action at all. Its ending is overlong and goes way too long without any laughs.But that is the only thing I didn't like about the movie. De Niro and Crystal have a real chemistry, even more so here than in the first film. De Niro steals the scenes he is in, and Crystal steals the scenes he is in, and when they are both on screen, you're not sure who to look at.I find Robert De Niro's latest journeys into comedy quite funny. He made a few comedies here and there in the past, but in the last three years he's coughed out some funny movies. "Analyze This," "Meet the Parents," "Analyze That," and to a certain degree (it was okay), "Showtime."Perhaps I am confused. Maybe I need to see the first again. But having seen the original about twice, and "Analyze That" once, I can honestly say that I laughed more in "Analyze That" than I did watching "Analyze This." And if that's not a good sequel, I don't know what is.Here's to "Analyze This, That, and the Other Thing"!3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer

I was a big fan of Analyze this. That is why I was really disappointed with Analyze that, a film that could've been a lot better. Trust me, it's not as bad as Be Coll or anything. I was a big fan of Get shorty and I was disappointed with that movie's sequel also. Trust me, this ain't Be cool though. Years after he was put away, Paul Vitti comes out of Sing Sing prison, where he sang sang. He comes back to his therapist Ben Sobel(played by the great Billy Crystal), where he causes even more chaos than before. I loved the original film, but this film has a Whole ten yards thing going with it where it's just a little silly. I give both films(Analyze that and The Whole ten yards) the same rating though. Does this film come close to being as good as the original? No. But the film still works in some sort of way. I'll agree that it was a disappointment, but I still liked it.Analyze that:***/****

I went to see this movie with my friend Paulina when it first came out ... I really liked it's prequel ANALYZE THIS. I was expecting to laugh and be happy with it ... not wowed, but glad that i'd seen it. After about the first 20 minutes of me wrinkling my brow out of confusion to when it was going to get "good" I started to actually talk to my friend, which i never do during a movie, asking her if she liked it and asking her if her laughter was for real. This movie was an embarrassment for Robert Di Niro and Billy Crystal who have proved themselves over and over again. I felt like... why? WHY? Would they be so NOT picky in the material that they would choose? Why would they waste their time and talent on this piece of crap? She kept laughing and telling me she really liked it! I wish that I could erase the memory so I could go on loving Robert Di Niro and respecting him at the same time. I was also forced to look at Paulina in this awful light. How could I listen to anything she has to say if I couldn't understand how she could like such a mockery. I shortly after the movie started to be mean to her involuntarily because of this. A week later I never spoke to her again!

Sequel is mostly not a reputable thing in Hollywood. In one week, I was reviewing sequels to memorable comedies like (Arthur 2: On the Rocks - 1988), (The Odd Couple II - 1998), and now (Analyze That - 2002) to have a bad result all the way. I think the commercial exploitation reached its explosion at the 2000s. Away from that, just look at this example: Director (Brad Bird) after the smash success of his Oscar-winner (The Incredibles - 2004) refuses to make any sequel, prequel, spin-off and dedicates himself to make totally another movie, another Oscar-winner (Ratatouille - 2007). This is wise creative person with bold decisions to make.Unlike Mr. Bird, here, after the genius simple (Analyze This), they produced (Analyze That)! First off, the concept of this (That) was weak. I mean it could have been prettier idea to see some reversal as the mob man treats the doctor this time, or something like that. But unfortunately what we've seen was muddled, semi-pointless, and less funny compared to the first one.Basically the situations were on shaky ground. The credibility, which was smartly coherent in the first (Analyze), is lost. And to hide that, they made all the possible comic lines they could do, however none was well enough, and they showered the movie with really nasty jokes, which ended up as just nasty! The best of this movie remains its first half, where (De Niro) is a mad singing man, or undesirable guest, or failing at many jobs. As the second half was the best of perturbation; the wholly unfunny matter of the TV show (strange how they missed to produce any laughs out of it), some car chase, a sudden unbelievable heist, and one genuine fabricated happy end where (De Niro) must look as the criminal with the heart of gold, and everything finishes fine.(De Niro) became finally Mr. Hollywood; who's making the obligatory empty sequel. What a pity to hire a great comedian like him; who didn't have the chance much to express his talent at that area, merely to be in a nice sketch or two. I'm sorry to say it, but (Billy Crystal) makes outrageously his Razzie-worthy role and movie. If you looked closer you'd find that the script gave him nothing to do, so he had to manage with what appeared as his most ridiculous performance yet. (Harold Ramis) turns to remakes (Bedazzled - 2000), and sequels (Analyze That - 2002) after years of his "original" masterpiece as a writer, producer, and director (Groundhog Day - 1993). It's nearly the perfect case for what Hollywood does with its people at the insolvent boring 2000s!This movie is in disarray that makes it look poor. And after the success of the previous one, it's disappointing. What can I say? The absurd plot, the hasty dealing, and the easy dirty gags did it. The only good thing to be said about those couple of movies is that they're way better, and more watchable, than (De Niro)'s other candy bars of the same time: (Meet the Parents - 2000) and (Meet the Fockers - 2004) which were horrible.More often than not, the shadows of good movies, which they call sequels, can shadow effectively.

They are back, and Ben Sobel (Crystal) got more issues to deal with his patient who happens to be a Mob leader: Paul Vitti (De Niro). So folks Robert De Niro again with Billy Crystal, it turned out more fun then i expected, and I am hard to impress when it comes to sequels. Sequels often ruins the whole part of movie loving, in fact i couldn't imagine a sequel of ...on the top of my head "The Shawshank redemption" that would really make me angry. Anyway i could in no way say that this one is better than the first one, in fact it would be better if they just stopped after the first one, but actually this one was really funny (for a sequel), so it still gets 6/10 which is probably the highest vote for a sequel given by me...

I found this sequel to be as good if not better than the original (here's one thing it might have with the godfather series, aside from 'stealing' one of the scores for 10 seconds, teehee). It seemed as if the satirical elements in the film were handled more poignantly but at the same time, more light-heartedly than 'Analyze This'. The clashes of cultures, of personalities, inter-mob conflict & the FBI (FBI Agent's best line: "Just call the FBI's limousine service at 1-800-F**-Off", teeheehee) all work themselves-in pretty well here, the scenes are quite balanced with few excesses (i.e. overdoing some jokes to death). Some jokes/exploits are repeated a bunch of times, but they tend to be employed tactfully (i.e. I didn't feel embarrassed for the actors) and humorously (i.e. I laughed, I giggled). I confess I thought that this movie was not going to end up being up to par. I am pleased to be proven incorrect on that front. A good comedy and perhaps the best mob comedy (clearly one of the best).
In closing, amusing and well-worth the time if one is seeking some good laughs. Of course, that depends one one's sense of humor (people do die violently in this comedy) : but I suspect that most people going to see this one would already know more-or-less what to expect, and in this sense, I think they will be pleasantly surprised. I was.7.5/10

I saw "Analyze This" when it came on video some years ago and I liked it, it wasn´t exactly a laugh-out-loud comedy, but funny enough. One of its strong points was its cast: Robert DeNiro was perfect and Billy Crystal knows how to do comedy. Since then I have seen the film a few times on TV and I wouldn´t mind watching it once more. I can´t say the same about "Analyze That", though. The film is a real let-down and worth not missing."Analyze That" has everything expect for jokes that really work. The cast is without doubt full of rock-solid talents and everybody gives a good performance. I´ve always considered Lisa Kudrow my favorite of the Friends and in this film she has been given a few amusing lines. But where can you go with a script that simply isn´t funny? I was very disappointed in this film, you should get more from such a movie as "Analyze That".I guess "Analyze That" is just another sequel made because of the success of the first part. Too bad most of the sequels are made just because of money and no one cares about the script (another example: "MIIB"). Hopefully the poor box-office performance shows that "Analyze This & That Too" isn´t on the list of most-wanted movies.

"Analyze That", the first sequel to "Analyze This" is just more of the same. Of course, if you liked the original, that would be a good thing. If not...not.  Crystal continues as the reluctant shrink while DeNiro continues a the mob boss with issues in this madcap attempt to capitalize on the success of "...This" by punching up "...That" with strippers, car chases, stunts, shootouts, etc. Enjoyable but, like most sequels, lacking the freshness of the original. (B-)

I think I might have chuckled a couple of times.  A pretty tame film that tries to draw laughs from getting the straight laced Ben Sobel  (Billy Crystal) mixed up in the "Mobs" business as he seems to be trying to help someone, that he also knows doesn't need the help.  The situations were ridiculous, and unrealistic, which would be ok if it were a hilarious "screw-ball" comedy, but it falls way short on the comedy.

A sequel to the enjoyable Analyze This, 'Analyze That' is a partly funny sequel, that never achieves the wit & energy of its prequel, but works in its own way nonetheless. Despite a few shortcomings, there are some genuine laughs to be had here!'Analyze That' Synopsis: Mobster Paul Vitti is released into Dr. Ben Sobol's care, where only more chaos ensues.'Analyze That' has a strong first-hour, where the humor works. But, the second-hour slips into predictability & is low on laughs. In short, a lively first-hour is its high, but an underwhelming second-hour is its low!Kenneth Lonergan, Peter Tolan, Peter Steinfeld & Harold Ramis's Screenplay works in bits & pieces. One certainly is missing the wit of its much superior prequel. Ramis's Direction is decent, as always. Ramis knew his job & his loss makes his work all the more precious. Performance-Wise: Robert De Niro & Billy Crystal reprise their parts, most admirably. De Niro is simply brilliant as the don with a soft heart, while Crystal is responsible for the film's best laughs. Joe Viterelli, in his final role. is excellent. Lisa Kudrow is lovely in a small, but significant role.On the whole, 'Analyze That' isn't all-out funny, but it succeeds in making you laugh at parts.

"Analyze That" is a sequel to the 1999 film "Analyze This" that rather misses the reason why that latter film was enjoyable."Analyze This" was a movie that worked fairly well as an amusing comedy because of the chemistry between Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Their relationship was the heart of the picture, and the audience gravitated towards it.De Niro and Crystal are no worse here, but the script makes the mistake of not focusing on them enough. Instead, the majority of the film follows De Niro and his plans to get back into the "business." This persists until the final act, which turns into the most cliched mafia picture you've ever seen, nearly devoid of humor all together.All of this considered, however, the movie does feature some scenes between De Niro and Crystal, and when their doing their thing and bantering with each other, it's just as funny as the first film. That being said, I simply wish there was more of it."Analyze That" is not a terrible film, it's simply a mediocre and forgettable one that doesn't reach even the simple enjoyability of its predecessor.

All the revues said this was just o.k. but I have to tell you different. This film had me in stitches from the start. I am amazed how Robert DeNiro can be so strong in serious roles and yet he does comedy as good as any one. People like Robin Williams are trying to cross over to serious roles as is Jim Carrey and this guy makes it look like anybody could do it. Unreal !! Two thumbs way up for this one.

This is the sequel to Analyze this from 99. This movie is pretty darn good I thought can stand on it's own without the original,, Billy Cryystal and Robert DeNiro are back of course, some of the other characters are different, but the storyline goes like this,, Paul Vitti is in Sing , Sing prison in New York,, and other mob Families decides that it's time for Paul to sing his swan song,, preferably in the East River.. but Paul has other ideas, he fakes being insane, so he can get released into his pyschiatrist's care,, Dr. Sobel, and from there this is where it get's interesting,, he comes back to the dr's house and has to stay with them , and get a real you know,, job type job.. well after a few jobs he lands one, but slowly slips back into the Mafia persona, their he cuts a deal with one mob family to get the other one off his back, then a hit occurs on him, and he has to figure out which family ordered the hit.. very good movie,, lot's of good funny Mafia stuff in here.

25 May 2003. I only managed to see about a third of the movie I'm told. All right I was sleepy and tired to begin with so I fell asleep, but I deliberately wanted to after about thirty minutes or so of this movie. It was totally awful. I can't quite figure out why, but the characters were irritating, the script seemed stale and bland. The acting seemed force and not really heart-felt. This was one of the worst movies I've seen.
