SUPERHERO MOVIE, meet the Spartans, scary movie, date movie etc these all movies r just a parody of other movies.. n they do it really good. i recommend that if a person is going to watch any of these movies, kindly watch the movies on which that movie is made.only then one can enjoy. These movies don't have story of their own so u cannot understand them without watching other movies.i am sick of people giving bad comments to these movies. it is because they don't know what this movie is about. it is a little bigger budget parody thats it. so guys enjoy these movie.. n for this superhero movie only watching SPIDERMAN is enough as most of the story covers that movie.so enough said,hop that helps..

When a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly...Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. The X-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. Blazing Saddles this isn't! One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. This makes it even funnier. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them. As a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.As recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the awful Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.

I went to see this tonight after a long brutal week at the job where all I wanted to do was go to the theater, grab a beer and watch a entertaining, light comedy.Being a HUGE fan of Leslie Nielson from the POLICE SQUAD series thru all the NAKED GUN episodes, I thought this would be a fun movie.It was a nightmare...The sight gags only elicited a few chuckles from those in attendance... since most of them were used before,in the NAKED GUN (i.e. a scene where Nielson lets go of a wheelchair and it and his owner go flying off a building ala O.J. Simpson in NAKED GUN I).The only interesting scenes were some pretty good impersonations of Barry Bonds, Tony Bennett, Tom Cruise and Dr. Hawkins.Normally if I don't like a film it's because it most likely is I may not be the target audience of the writers and producers...but the audience consisted of males and females from children to Sr. Citizens.....and I rarely heard anything even remotely close to a chuckle.The banter between husband (Nielson) and Marion Ross was uncomfortable at best...and in a way sad, seeing two people who have had stellar, award winning careers now wandering aimlessly in this poorly thought out and written flop.I recommend not just holding back and wait for it to hit DVD...but even skip the DVD release.Save your money and re-rent Naked Gun or better yet, the Police Squad series for truly spoof mastery.

With all these bad Spoof movies like Date movie, Not Another Teen Movie,Epic Movie and Disaster Movie (which is the worst spoof movie ever).So i was thinking this will be the same, but my god, this movie made me laugh so much, This so much better then others movies listed above.Plot: In this spoof of Hollywood blockbusters, director and screenwriter Craig Mazin (THE SPECIALS) tackles the age-old story of a regular guy who suddenly finds that he possesses super powers. Ricky Riker (Drake Bell) is a typical teenager, except that his luck is worse then most. Basically, he's a loser. He's been in love with beautiful Jill (Sara Paxton) for years, but is sure she doesn't know he exists. Even his best friend, Trey (Kevin Hart), is willing to throw him over for another clique. But Rick's life changes dramatically when a genetically enhanced dragonfly bites him during a school field trip. In a flash, he becomes the Dragonfly. He can scale buildings, and has immense strength--though he's still a klutz. Rick isn't sure he has what it takes to be a superhero, but it's up to him to save the city from the villainous Hourglass (Christopher McDonald), who literally sucks the life out of people, and threatens to harm those dearest to Rick. Mazin, The main spoof is spider man they also spoof Batman, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men.I love this movie , well the last spoof movie I Saw was Disaster movie, that was oh my god, that movie was SO bad ) (That is one the reason why i like this more then I Should)The superhero movie is one of the better spoof to come out last year, I am not saying it the best spoof.I enjoyed it!

The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof which is your introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of "Drake & Josh" fame, personally I'd have given the movie to Josh who is much funnier) and the "Rick Punchers" joke is lifted right out of Airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film. Rick's class is on a science trip to The Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG) playing Dr Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly which is where his powers come from.We meet our next big star names at Rick's home, his Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross of Happy Days fame) & Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielson of Airplane, Police Squad & Naked Gun fame). And we're introduced to Carlson on the Amalgamated Board of Directors (Dan Castellaneta from The Simpsons) who is then very promptly killed. We're told Rick has slept for 5 days & get some cheap, crappy sexually orientated scenes designed to get the teen male audience paying attention. The Stephen Hawking lookalike's scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesn't work and isn't remotely funny.We get another Spiderman spoof (Rick catching the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end right there as Jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball which would have broken her skull and killed her stone dead. You get to see Rick's 1st powers emerge (gripping ability & speed) then his 1st rescue which goes very wrong. We also get an incest reference which is in very poor taste indeed. We get a flashback and a Batman spoof in which we discover Rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents. Spoofing Spiderman again Ricks Uncle is shot with Jeffrey Tambor (from Hellboy) playing the Hospital Doctor. We then get an X-men spoof (done very badly as Patrick Stewart is about as white as they come), Barry Bonds is played by yet another lookalike.We meet Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson looking stunning in her costume!). Ricks 1st outing in his costume (once he fixes his ability to see & breath through it) is another Batman spoof. The Tom Cruise Youtube interview clip is played by yet another lookalike (and not a very good one at that). There are lots of modern references like Youtube, Facebook & Wikipedia all showing that the movie is set in modern day. There's a very weak gay joke (never a good idea to do those either) when Jill is helping Aunt Lucille make Thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene isn't very funny, just infantile.The Aunt farting scene isn't particularly funny, just incredibly childish. Anyone finding it funny must have a mental age of about 12. She's killed and then we have a really bad necrophilia joke (is there no topic these people won't try to use to get a cheap laugh out of?) at her funeral, and the even worse cremation joke.We get the 2 worst lookalikes in the whole movie (Prince Charles & Nelson Mandela) at the awards ceremony and if you didn't already know how infantile or stupidly lowbrow this movie is Landers wins the "Douchebag Of The Year" award. Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past Jill twice in the same direction).Obviously The Hourglass is foiled, Jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one.

Don't waste your time going to see this movie. I'm a huge fan of Leslie Nielsen and love all of the Airplane and Police Squad movies. This was a sad attempt at trying to use the same type of humor but unfortunately it was just one crude sex joke after another. There were some funny moments, but they were very rare.I'm also an enormous fan of Drake Bell and his TV show that's targeted toward teens. I am completely and utterly disappointed in Drake Bell for his poor performance and complete inappropriateness during most of this movie.This movie was a great idea and the Dragonfly character was a good concept. The special effects were done well. Unfortunately, this movie just simply wasn't funny at all.

It's official, this will be the last modern parody movie I ever see. After Meet The Spartans, I don't know why I even bothered with this thing. The concept and the trailer seemed funny but, believe me, it's not.It is, without a doubt, a huge swing and a miss given the potential. The trailer contained the only material that could be considered funny. I never laughed once during the entire movie. It also was remarkably mean spirited. Unless you find death, cruelty, nearly naked fat guys and senior flatulence funny, I wouldn't bother with this waste of film. Potty humor and a genuine meanness was all this thing offered. No intelligent parody, no real sexual innuendo and no genuine laughs AT ALL. One of the year's worst movies.

I'm going to be saying some of negatives and gripes I had with the movie, but just remember I still gave this a 6 because it was funny at times.I'm a big fan of flatulent comedy when done right. Blazing Saddles did it beautifully (and was the first movie ever to have an on screen fart). Superhero movie seems to very single-minded on this aspect: old people = farts. One of the fart scenes was a little funny at first, but then goes on way too long.This movie is called Superhero Movie yet is devoid of spoofs from most of them. It only spoofs three movies: mainly Spider-man, a little X-men, and a tiny bit of Batman Begins. Sadly, here the writer fell into the same mindset of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who have almost destroyed the spoof genre with their atrocities Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans. What made spoofs of old so good was when they spoofed a genre they didn't just look at the new hot commodities, they looked at all the films in that genre across the years. A more recent spoof who did it well was Not Another Teen Movie. It not only spoofed the new aged Freddy Prince Jr teen romance movies, but also went back to the John Hughes films of the 80's. I think this spoof would be more accessible to people outside of high school had he threw in some spoofs of the old Batman or Superman movies. Maybe even a little bit of a throwback to the Adam West Batman or Lou Ferrigno Hulk TV shows.My last gripe is about the main actor Drake Bell. He might work for little kids on Nickelodeon, but he doesn't for this movie. For the sake of brevity I'll just say that if you see this movie you'll know what I'm talking about.Those were some serious gripes, but it doesn't mean I didn't laugh. One scene in particular had me in stitches. The scene spoofed the Spider-man scene where Parker is late for dinner and is hiding from a searching Osborn on the ceiling of his room. I couldn't stop myself from laughing. I thought the scene was brilliant. Though some jokes do fall flat it is bound to happen when you spring a new joke every 15 to 30 seconds.

This movie was definitely a major standout in the recent pile of crappy "spoof" movies that have been made more recently (Epic Movie, Date Movie etc.). I was expecting it to be better than these anyway, but it was still better than I expected.I think the main plus about this was its format. They finally went back to what worked in the first couple of Scary Movies - they followed a plot from a single movie and just made fun of it. There were a couple of side notes but they still linked in quite well to the overall plot. Even with a couple of try-hard comedic moments, the story flowed well and it wasn't a clumsy mish-mash of anything and everything to do with superhero movies. I was laughing most of the way through.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked the first couple of Scary Movies.

OK...the trailer gave me hope, the original trailer that is, that this movie would finally bring back those awesome jokes and gags from the great Airplane! and Naked Gun films, and it did, of course not as efficiently. This is a great great great start for all of us who want to see the great spoof movies make a comeback. There were some gags that went a little over the top, not to my surprise, but there were other gags that brought back memories of those classic movies. There was not so much pop culture as the other vomit-enducing movies like Meet the Spartans and other atrocities, but of course there was, but we cant blame them, there was pop culture references back in the Airplane movies as well. It put a smile on my face when i heard a good phrase in this movie: "Fruitcake?" "Oh no, i just haven't met the right woman". You have to be honest, that definitely brings back some hope that the producers are trying to bring it back. I say give it a try, I own all the great spoofs on DVD, i know my spoof movies, and i can guarantee that this movie is not as bad as others may say it is, and it totally makes Meet the Spartans and Epic movie look the garbage they are.

I had wanted to see this movie for quite some time, and when I finally got the chance, I found that I enjoyed most of it. This movies basically follows the Spider-man movie line by line, with a few deviations leading into the X-men and The Fantastic Four. THe Camera Work was great, and I could tell that they had good directing. Many of the jokes are cheesy, but will still make you laugh. Honestly, don't go into this movie thinking that it's just like Epic movie, Date movie, or Meet the Spartans, it is much better. I personally believe that it is worth the title of Scary Movie successor. Another plus would be the excellent lighting.Overall, I think it's worth your time, it's got plenty of laughs. I would not suggest it for younger kid's, as several adult content jokes are made.

In a world of parodies that are just complete trash with a funny moment or two, this one is pretty dang good!! This movie parodies Spiderman (the Raimi/McGuire movies) with some other Marvel characters thrown into the mix.Rick is a nobody high schooler who wants to impress the girl living next door. While on a school trip to a science lab, Rick is bitten by a genetically enhanced Dragonfly, and begins to show superhuman abilities. Will he become the hero his city needs?As I said, this movie is plenty entertaining, witha great cast, and it actually doesn't rely solely on on trash humor (although there is a lil bit). I'd give it a 6.2 rating.

The "movie" movie series was really going for a while there (All the Scary Movies had me in stitches) it bombed for a while when Adam Seltz and Jason Friedburg took over and here is a brief show is a list of ratings of some of the other "movie" movies: Date Movie: 57% Epic Movie: 50% Meet The Spartans: 48% But with this one the series gets better with Superhero films being sent up in a playful way and it is actually really funny. It is a little hit and miss but I think that adds to the final feel to the "dumbness" to the film. I think that this is worth a view for the fans of Scary Movie and haters of the later "movie" movies. Overall this is a good and funny film good for a laugh once or twice and I give it a fair rating of 65%.

Watching Superhero Movie feels like you're re-watching one of the Naked Gun movies, only there are "deleted scenes" which unfortunately feature pop culture references and fart jokes. It's a fun movie if you're into the genre but overall falls far too short of being as good as the classics.The cast is great for the material they're working with, with some exceptions being those who are given too little screen time to show their talents. Musician/actor Drake Bell's comedic timing is impressive, as is that of spoof legend Leslie Nielsen.The humor, a combination of slapstick, wordplay and sex/toilet humor, is hit and miss, but hits more often than one would think. The spoofs range from clever to cringe-worthy, but the story and resultant gags follow the source material (mostly 2002's Spider-Man) very well, as opposed to the "Hey, look! It's -insert character- from -insert popular movie-!" style other recent spoofs have adopted. The only roadblocks are the childish fart jokes (one of which spans minutes) and dated pop culture references (Tom Cruise? Barry Bonds? Really?).It's due to all of this that the movie, although flawed, can appeal to fans of any kind of spoof movie, be it twenty years old or two. It's also able to fulfill the expectations of the average moviegoer while giving some clever surprises to those who don't see them coming. Simply put, if you're a fan of any type of comedy, there's bound to be something in this joke-a-second spoof for you.

Superhero Movie is the latest in the line of spoofs that seem to fall off a toilet assembly line. As if you didn't already realize it just yet, this movie spoofs superhero movies. The main comic book movie the film is parodying is Spider Man, but there are a few other ones thrown in just for namesake. The story follows Rick Riker (Drake Bell), an unpopular student who is in love with his neighbor Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton) and dreams of being with her. His parents died when he was young and he is raised by his Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielson) and Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross). But one day on a class trip to a science organization Rick is accidentally bitten by a dragonfly. Soon he begins to develop superpowers and really has no idea what to do with them. Meanwhile an insane scientist Lou Landers (Christopher Mcdonald) has created a DNA moleculizer, and after using it he realizes he has the power to kill people by touching them. Landers turns himself into the evil arch villain Hourglass, and begins plotting to take over (what else?) the world! After learning this Rick turns himself into the green-suited superhero Dragonfly. He begins fighting crime, and with the support of his family and new girlfriend goes after Hourglass.So the clouds are beginning to lift...Oh I'm sorry I didn't mean for this movie. No Superhero movie is as awful a spoof as they come. What I meant is that I checked the box office charts for this opening week. Superhero Movie only made $9.5 million on opening week and is sure to be gone from cinemas soon. And that may mean that finally audiences are learning that these garbage spoofs are not worth admission price. If this keeps up maybe there will be no more spoofs, and that would sure brighten up the world (and our theaters).Now for the review of Superhero Movie. Let me start off with the positive: Leslie Nielson is funny in this movie. Nielson is a pioneer in the genre with spoofs like Airplane and the Naked Gun series. He knows how to make the jokes work in a spoof, no matter how vulgar or just downright stupid they are. I would love to watch a new spoof with him as the main character, but that's just not the case for atrocious alleged parody. Other than Leslie Nielson this film is an absolute abomination. Hollywood knows that these movies make big money at the box office so they just keep financing and releasing these cheap, lazy, and unfunny spoofs just for a quick cash-grab. Superhero Movie is cheap looking with awful special effects and costumes. The acting is very bad especially from Christopher Mcdonald who literally makes a fool out of himself. The usually likable Drake Bell also gives a bad performance, but you can't really blame him because he deserved more than this trash since he, unlike the writers, has actual talent.The jokes in Superhero Movie are an all time low in flatness, and consist mostly of unfunny farts, injuries, vomiting, a few celebrity jokes, and pop culture references. This is really it with these pop culture references, I've hit rock bottom with them. It is not funny that all Apple's products start with the letter "i"; the cellphone commercials where you have "your 5" haven't been on TV in months, so it was stupid to resurrect it. This movie did not have nearly as many pop culture references as the below dreadful Meet the Spartans, but they are still really unfunny and just plain lazy in execution. Speaking of lazy Superhero Movie tries to parody Fantastic Four, Batman, and even X Men. Well the X Men parody is supposed to shift the plot, but only lasts five minutes and is so abysmally written that there's nothing to laugh at. Pamela Anderson actually shows up for literally 20 seconds as Invisible Woman. What's the real point in that? However here's where this movie now officially hits an offensive low never before discovered in the spoof genre. Superhero Movie offensively makes fun of Stephen Hawking with jokes about him wanting to commit suicide and having no self esteem. The film also makes fun of Barry Bonds' steroid use, and also cracks a racist joke on Nelson Mandela. That is not funny it's just insulting because these idiotic filmmakers obviously have no respect for any person that is smarter or more important than them. The fact that kids get to watch these jokes unfold on a pretty silver screen makes me yearn for the future.Superhero Movie is a downright terrible spoof and it should get flushed down the toilet along with movies like Meet the Spartans, Date Movie, and Epic Movie. I give Superhero Movie a 0.5 out of 4, but only because of Leslie Nielson. Hopefully these spoofs stop getting made, since this one is the first sign of weakness at the box office.

With all these bad Spoof movies like Date movie, Not Another Teen Movie,Epic Movie and Disaster Movie (which is the worst spoof movie ever).So i was thinking this will be the same, but my god, this movie made me laugh so much, This so much better then others movies listed above.Plot: In this spoof of Hollywood blockbusters, director and screenwriter Craig Mazin (THE SPECIALS) tackles the age-old story of a regular guy who suddenly finds that he possesses super powers.

Mazin, The main spoof is spider man they also spoof Batman, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men.I love this movie , well the last spoof movie I Saw was Disaster movie, that was oh my god, that movie was SO bad ) (That is one the reason why i like this more then I Should)The superhero movie is one of the better spoof to come out last year, I am not saying it the best spoof.I enjoyed it!

Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past Jill twice in the same direction).Obviously The Hourglass is foiled, Jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one.

I really liked this one. I wasn't expecting much, being worn out on spoof movies lately because of the layer of crap that's been dropped on us, the movie-going public. "Epic Movie","Date Movie","Meet the Spartans" all sucked.That being said, the people who made this, made the latter-day Zucker- styled comedies(a la Airplane, The Naked Gun) Scary Movie 3 & 4, and not those other "Movie" movies (which are the domain of Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer).There were parts of this movie where I laughed so hard I could barely breathe. And that happens SO rarely with comedies lately. Seriously, I laughed hard.But, it was one of those things that will entertain but never be a classic you'd bother watching again. It was a bit forgettable in that way.

I appreciate spoofs such as "Scary Movie" and "Not Another Teen Movie", but this one was just too corny.It didn't have any physical comedy like Scary Movie (Wayans), nor did it have a smart/funny dialogue like Not Another Teen Movie. The acting was not bad, but they definitely needed physically funny people (Wayans, Jim Carrey, Jack Black...etc). The lead character was OK, but he's definitely not comedy material (especially that kinda comedy).That being said, there were 3 or 4 scenes that were really funny and everyone in the theater was laughing. But that was it! If you still wanna go watch it, go with very low expectations. My problem is that i was expecting something like Scary Movie. I'd give it a 4.9/10

Okay, I know when it comes to these types of movies, You don't really expect much, You know they have a very bad reputation because the awful Date Movie and Epic Movie and the awfuller Disaster Movie, So I went watching this movie with an open mind and very low expectations.. and let me tell ya, This movie really surprised me...This has to be one of the funniest parody movies I've ever seen in a long time and believe me I have seen ALOT of them for some reason, It's takes perfect advantage of the medium It's parodying and it takes seriously funny jabs at the tropes and cliches the superhero genre always had..The movie follow our average awkward every day teenager having troubles confessing his love to his crush until a mutated dragonfly bites him and gives him superpowers (except flying), This (If you didn't notice already) makes fun of the Spider-Man movies (Specifically the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie) and again it takes perfect advantage of that.This movie is simply hilarious, The humor is ridiculous, fast-paced and dumb but not dumb to the point where you lose interest in the story and characters, Oh yeah and It's crude, I think you've guessed that already if you've watched any of the 'Scary Movie' movies, Seriously not ten minutes into the movie and we see the main character getting humped by a bunch of animals.. Yeah this movie is not for everyone, and of course this movie has alot of these stupid unfunny poop, puke, fart jokes but because of the fast-paced nature of the film you won't get bored, Oh you didn't like this joke, Here's another one, Oh you didn't like that joke, Oh take this one then.I had such a good time with this one, Great jokes with a lighthearted tone and an amazing cast, Seriously, I didn't expect Leslie Nielsen to be in this movie this much, Like I thought he would be in it for like ten minutes but no, He's actually one of the main characters, That was a pleasant surprise, May he rest in peace..And the villain is unironically great, Like seriously, Christopher McDonald didn't have to go this hard acting that character, He was seriously great, Like I could see him and his plan in a real superhero movie!I highly recommend this one, Don't wanna repeat myself too much but yeah, This movie is just dumb fun and that's all I want from a superhero spoof movie, Mostly great jokes with a great cast and not-very-bad special effects, Get some friends, Get some popcorn and enjoy this ridiculous hilarious underrated movie.

If "Superhero Movie" gives you the same giddy, guilty-pleasure feeling as "Airplane!" and the "Naked Gun" movies, it's no accident. Some of those movies' personnel  who were also involved in two lesser "Scary Movie" sequels  show up here. (Those include writer-director Craig Mazin, who happily has come a long way from 1997's abysmal "Rocketman.")The movie's title says it all. It's a comedy that takes a well-known hit (in this case, "Spider-Man"), turns it inside out, and uses it as a clothesline for gags. In this parody version, nerdy Rick Riker (amiable Drake Bell of cable-TV's "Drake and Josh") gets bitten by a mutant dragonfly, turning him into...well, take a guess. Meanwhile, a well-meaning scientist (Chris McDonald) turns nasty when his experiment backfires and he finds he must sap others' life-blood in order to keep himself alive.As is typical of such parodies, the movie's approach is as subtle as a spitball gun. Some of the gags are terrific, and some are groaners. But they're all fired at such a rapid pace that after a while, you have no choice but to give in to the silliness. The characters are like shooting-gallery ducks waiting to have parody lobbied at them. Best of the bunch are Rick's well-meaning but dotty uncle and aunt (delightfully played by Leslie Nielsen and "Happy Days'" Marion Ross). The most pitiable is a take-off on disabled genius Stephen Hawking, who seems to push Mazin's bad-taste button over and over ad nauseum.This leads me to the movie's most required caveat. While the flick is mostly silly fun, it pushes its "PG-13" rating right up to the edge of the "R" cliff. The movie is larded with sexual gags and profanity abound, and what might possibly be cinema's longest-ever flatulence gag.But if you can bear up under the cringe factor, "Superhero Movie" is mostly high-powered fun. Nifty comedy here runs neck-and-neck with bad taste. It's a close race, but the comedy wins."Superhero Movie" is rated PG-13 for countless sex and drug references, crude humor, and adult language.

Don't waste your time going to see this movie. I'm a huge fan of Leslie Nielsen and love all of the Airplane and Police Squad movies. This was a sad attempt at trying to use the same type of humor but unfortunately it was just one crude sex joke after another. There were some funny moments, but they were very rare.I'm also an enormous fan of Drake Bell and his TV show that's targeted toward teens. I am completely and utterly disappointed in Drake Bell for his poor performance and complete inappropriateness during most of this movie.This movie was a great idea and the Dragonfly character was a good concept. The special effects were done well. Unfortunately, this movie just simply wasn't funny at all.

It's official, this will be the last modern parody movie I ever see. After Meet The Spartans, I don't know why I even bothered with this thing. The concept and the trailer seemed funny but, believe me, it's not.It is, without a doubt, a huge swing and a miss given the potential. The trailer contained the only material that could be considered funny. I never laughed once during the entire movie. It also was remarkably mean spirited. Unless you find death, cruelty, nearly naked fat guys and senior flatulence funny, I wouldn't bother with this waste of film. Potty humor and a genuine meanness was all this thing offered. No intelligent parody, no real sexual innuendo and no genuine laughs AT ALL. One of the year's worst movies.

I'm going to be saying some of negatives and gripes I had with the movie, but just remember I still gave this a 6 because it was funny at times.I'm a big fan of flatulent comedy when done right. Blazing Saddles did it beautifully (and was the first movie ever to have an on screen fart). Superhero movie seems to very single-minded on this aspect: old people = farts. One of the fart scenes was a little funny at first, but then goes on way too long.This movie is called Superhero Movie yet is devoid of spoofs from most of them. It only spoofs three movies: mainly Spider-man, a little X-men, and a tiny bit of Batman Begins. Sadly, here the writer fell into the same mindset of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who have almost destroyed the spoof genre with their atrocities Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans. What made spoofs of old so good was when they spoofed a genre they didn't just look at the new hot commodities, they looked at all the films in that genre across the years. A more recent spoof who did it well was Not Another Teen Movie. It not only spoofed the new aged Freddy Prince Jr teen romance movies, but also went back to the John Hughes films of the 80's. I think this spoof would be more accessible to people outside of high school had he threw in some spoofs of the old Batman or Superman movies. Maybe even a little bit of a throwback to the Adam West Batman or Lou Ferrigno Hulk TV shows.My last gripe is about the main actor Drake Bell. He might work for little kids on Nickelodeon, but he doesn't for this movie. For the sake of brevity I'll just say that if you see this movie you'll know what I'm talking about.Those were some serious gripes, but it doesn't mean I didn't laugh. One scene in particular had me in stitches. The scene spoofed the Spider-man scene where Parker is late for dinner and is hiding from a searching Osborn on the ceiling of his room. I couldn't stop myself from laughing. I thought the scene was brilliant. Though some jokes do fall flat it is bound to happen when you spring a new joke every 15 to 30 seconds.

I took my 14 year old to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R at the least. I am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was WAY beyond crude. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was. I could not believe that it would be OK for a 13 year old to read and see this content. I don't understand how the rating system works.??

This movie was definitely a major standout in the recent pile of crappy "spoof" movies that have been made more recently (Epic Movie, Date Movie etc.). I was expecting it to be better than these anyway, but it was still better than I expected.I think the main plus about this was its format. They finally went back to what worked in the first couple of Scary Movies - they followed a plot from a single movie and just made fun of it. There were a couple of side notes but they still linked in quite well to the overall plot. Even with a couple of try-hard comedic moments, the story flowed well and it wasn't a clumsy mish-mash of anything and everything to do with superhero movies. I was laughing most of the way through.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked the first couple of Scary Movies.

OK...the trailer gave me hope, the original trailer that is, that this movie would finally bring back those awesome jokes and gags from the great Airplane! and Naked Gun films, and it did, of course not as efficiently. This is a great great great start for all of us who want to see the great spoof movies make a comeback. There were some gags that went a little over the top, not to my surprise, but there were other gags that brought back memories of those classic movies. There was not so much pop culture as the other vomit-enducing movies like Meet the Spartans and other atrocities, but of course there was, but we cant blame them, there was pop culture references back in the Airplane movies as well. It put a smile on my face when i heard a good phrase in this movie: "Fruitcake?" "Oh no, i just haven't met the right woman". You have to be honest, that definitely brings back some hope that the producers are trying to bring it back. I say give it a try, I own all the great spoofs on DVD, i know my spoof movies, and i can guarantee that this movie is not as bad as others may say it is, and it totally makes Meet the Spartans and Epic movie look the garbage they are.

just one week after it was out when i went to go see it it was just me and a group of three people that was it and I'm sure that these people must have the humour of five year olds because they laughed at about every time he fell over or hit his head on the bus which you can see on the trailer so although it isn't funny it becomes even less funny after you see it again i would think that the few people that actually go see this movie actually have no brain because it would be torture to watch again i didn't really find anything funny about it i just don't get why miramax wastes their money on drake from drake and josh and the whole cast and the actual money I'm sure if they really though about it they would find that it would be better to give the money they used to make the film to fund say ikea or even a pointless wallpaper shop with no wallpaper in it than waste it on this crap movie

I had wanted to see this movie for quite some time, and when I finally got the chance, I found that I enjoyed most of it. This movies basically follows the Spider-man movie line by line, with a few deviations leading into the X-men and The Fantastic Four. THe Camera Work was great, and I could tell that they had good directing. Many of the jokes are cheesy, but will still make you laugh. Honestly, don't go into this movie thinking that it's just like Epic movie, Date movie, or Meet the Spartans, it is much better. I personally believe that it is worth the title of Scary Movie successor. Another plus would be the excellent lighting.Overall, I think it's worth your time, it's got plenty of laughs. I would not suggest it for younger kid's, as several adult content jokes are made.

Sometimes I have a soft spot for movies like this. I admit I do. But I honestly can't for a millisecond either recommend this to anyone who likes/loves spoof movies or just want a couple of laughs which is a no-brainer as far as comedies are concerned but they could do better than this. To a certain extent, some are willing to give the benefit of a doubt, though mostly squarely on this one because such arguments often warrant it. On the other hand, you could do worse in a much recent AND similar movie like...for example "Meet the Spartans". The less said about that one the better (this is to those who are still reeling from the aftermath of said movie). There are tons of poke-fun-at-moments in Superhero, but they're mainly aimed at Spider-Man; obviously a "revenge" of sorts, especially Spider-Man 3, the only thing in this movie I can give credit for. However, this film, ultimately, is guilty of the usual suspects of its predecessors: Cookie-cutter-comedy syndrome on a conventional level of ordinary American cheese. If you can't see past the truth that is so blatantly in front of you at face value, then you either need glasses or are just out of touch with reality COMPLETELY.

This is way better than most films that spoof other films. It's a million times better than the likes of Epic Movie, Disaster Movie and many other pathetic attempts to parody other films. Unlike most films that spoof others this one gets the job done without overdoing it and at times it even felt like an actual Superhero film as well as talented cast members that fit their roles perfectly and the villain "The Hourglass" was good considering it was a parody film. It also has various comedy elements of its own such as Lucille's funeral and many more moments that I would mention but I don't want to spoil the film. At the funeral The priest says "We are gathered here today to say goodbye to Lucille" then all the people at the funeral shout "Goodbye!".If you plan to watch this film do not judge it on the low rating. It's a pity most parody films weren't as good as this.

It's getting harder and harder to sit through these parodies. However, I really enjoyed this one. Sure, you'll find a lot of the same humor here that you'll find in the Scary Movies and other dumb genre spoofs. But this time, there's at least a solid story behind it rather than being entirely non-sequitur. There's not nearly as much gross-out gags in this one, and there are solid performances from Drake Bell, Christopher MacDonald and others. The superhero genre is ripe for parody, while action films, chick flicks, and slasher movies have all been done to death. The film's score isn't bad either, but to get right down to the point, it's nice to see a comedy film that can actually make you laugh

Superhero Movie was not even close to as good as I thought it would be. Although I didn't like it im not going to lie it was pretty funny throughout the whole movie. I thought that it would have had more of a point to it. It made fun of only one movie and that was Spider Man. This had to honestly be the shortest movie I have ever seen. They might say its 1 hour and 20 minutes but it doesn't even get to that. The previews took up 10 minutes and then 1 hour of the movie. I really wasn't that mad that it wasn't that long because if it was it would have been worse. The only thing that really saved this movie were a couple of the characters in it. I think that one more bad thing about the movie was that they didn't show enough of the good characters in it. Sara Paxton really was the one who saved this movie. She was very pretty once again. I think that out of all the scary movies, Meet The Spartans, Epic Movie, and Date movie this was the worst yet. They all also seem to be very short for some reason. I think that they run out of things to put in the movies. In this movie thought they kept making each scene to long. In each of the funny scenes it was like wow thats funny then 20 seconds later it would still be going on, it was like just end the scene. When you go into this kind of movie though you have to expect a short and stupid movie. This was probably the most stupid movie I have ever seen. This was definitely not worth 10 dollars on going to see. If you need to go see this only spend like 7 dollars or wait for DVD. Overall this was a stupid and pointless movie thrown in with a couple good laughs.
