Overall, I really liked this movie, which surprised me a little bit. The trailers I had seen for it had me thinking it was going to be kind of "cheesy" for lack of a better word, but this was actually very engrossing. It had an interesting story line, sustained suspense and for the most part was well acted.I particularly liked Brittany Murphy as Elisabeth Burrows, the psychiatric inmate whose tortured mind holds the information that Dr. Conrad (Michael Douglas) needs to get in order to save his young daughter Jessie's (Skye McCole Bartusiak) life. Murphy seemed so "into" her character that it was almost spooky to watch her. She was extremely convincing. Douglas I thought also offered up a good performance, as did Sean Bean as Patrick, the head kidnapper. Young Miss Bartusiak was commendable but to me didn't seem to portray the range of emotions I would expect a young child to be feeling in Jesse's circumstances. She just seemed altogether too calm. The same could be said for Famke Janssen as Jessie's mother Aggie Conrad. I realize the character had a broken leg and apparently couldn't get out of bed, but again she just seemed to take the whole thing too calmly (and, when her own life was threatened she seemed able to move around well enough, broken leg or not!) As for Oliver Platt as Conrad's colleague Dr. Sachs? I find that, depending on the movie, I either like Platt or don't (no middle ground) and I didn't care for him in this movie.Overall, though, the movie was quite good as a vehicle for Douglas. I'd rate it as a 7/10.

Here's another interesting kidnap story. Sean Bean always plays a believable villain and Michael Douglas usually plays roles that keep the audience's attention....so the almost- two hours go by pretty quickly. The whole cast, actually, pretty good with no one person standing out.The story loses points because the ending goes on too long and has the standard villain-holds-the-gun-and-doesn't shoot-too long clich√© which drives critics, me included crazy. That, and a bit too many f-words in here by the female cop (Jennifer Esposito) which simply aren't necessary, and a few other holes all reduce this from a sure 9-star to an "8.....but don't misunderstand: it's worth a look.

My 11 year old nephew said it was the scariest movie he's ever seen.  I can't quite agree with that, but the level of intensity and the fast moving plot really impressed me, even if it all didn't quite add up in the end.  I can't remember a movie that I've seen in awhile that just MOVED along so well and had so little downtime. Given the 'deadline', it felt like it was in real-time for the second half of the movie. I was a little bothered by Michael Douglas having a wife the age of Famke. I love her and its not a knock against her but there was no need to keep up Douglas' legacy of attracting wives under 35 for him.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Demi Moore and Daryl Hannah have all been love interests for him - why?  Because its the male fantasy?  Reeks of insecurity to me.  Plus I don't see Dame Judi Dench romancing Leo, do I?  Meryl Streep and James Franco?  Anyway, this is not important, just slightly annoying.  There are questions I'd like to ask the screenwriter because there are inconsistencies along the way and about one or two things that are totally out of the question.  However, as I mentioned, the movie moves along so fast that you might not have time to dwell on anything for too long. I don't think it was speeded up to cover anything up either.  The best part is the acting, especially by Brittany Murphy.  I didn't enjoy her in "Clueless" but really loved her in "Girl Interupted" and thought she was the best thing about that movie.  Here she gives it all, in a part that could have been laughed off the screen if it weren't played exactly right. Jennifer Esposito is also very believable as a cop, Sean Bean as a kidnapper and, as mentioned, Famke as a trophy wife.  Worth watching, for sure.  7/10.

This thriller certainly is a good enough one to watch and it also is a very professionally made one but it however offers very little new or refreshing enough material. It makes "Don't Say a Word" nothing more than a standard thriller, with some good actors in it.The cast is really the saving grace of the movie. It still provides the movie with some good moments and characters and also give the movie an extra sense of professionalism involved. Sean Bean is a great as the main villain and delivers an absolute fine performance. Michael Douglas is also great as the leading man, mainly because he doesn't play him as an 'hero' but an ordinary everyday person instead. Douglas is always fine in these sort of roles. Some other excellent actors play some smaller parts in the movie. Actors such as; Brittany Murphy, Oliver Platt, Victor Argo and last but not least Famke Janssen. They all help to make the movie look better and more interesting than it in fact really is. Most of the characters are however pretty flat. Why does Famke Janssen even play the wife? It's a role basically every actress could had played. This movie just didn't seem like a very challenging or original project to get involved with. And I also have the feeling that the movie would had been better of without the Jennifer Esposito. Just think about it, was she really necessary for the movie and its story? Her character is not engaging enough, since it's not she we need to care about or cheer for but the Michael Douglas character instead, who is the main lead of the movie. Her character is distracting from the movie its main story.The movie is certainly style-full and it does have its moments. But in the end it just really falls flat as a really good or original thriller. All of the moments in the movie are just too predictable and the movie doesn't offer any real surprises. Therefor this movie just isn't anymore than a well made but standard formulaic thriller.It's a movie that does serve its purpose and the movie certainly is watchable as a simple standard thriller. Fans of the genre will probably still be the most entertained by it but even they have to conclude that this movie is far from being one of the best thrillers released in recent years. It's the sort of movie that is only quite good enough to watch it just maybe once. Don't expect too much of this and you might end up liking it good enough.Nothing too remarkable, just a well made, simple thriller, with some great actors in it.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

"Don't Say A Word" is an entertaining "race against time" thriller with plenty of action, some good acting and a few neat twists. Visually, it's easy on the eye and its plot involves bank robbery, murder and kidnapping as well as an ordinary man who has to do something extraordinary in order to save the life of his child. The stakes are high and the tension grows steadily until things become even more desperate as time starts to run out. Interestingly, the story has a few different strands which eventually converge and the pace of the action is lively throughout.A gang breaks into a bank and steals just one high value item (a gem worth $10 million) but after making a clean getaway, it's soon discovered that one of the criminals has double-crossed his associates and has absconded with the jewel. The other gang members then hunt him down and kill him in a subway station.Ten years later, after having served their time in prison, the gang kidnap the 8-year-old daughter of Dr Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas) who's a highly respected New York psychiatrist. Conrad is a specialist in dealing with teenage patients and the kidnappers demand that he elicit from one of his patients a 6-digit number which is buried somewhere in her troubled mind. Jessie Conrad (Skye McCole Bartusiak) is abducted early in the morning of Thanksgiving Day and Dr Conrad is given until 5.00pm to get the necessary information. If he fails Jessie will be killed.Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy) is a particularly challenging patient who has been institutionalised for many years and has displayed a confusing variety of symptoms. Conrad eventually gains her cooperation when he tells her that his daughter has been kidnapped and through his efforts, it's gradually discovered that her trauma originated in an incident, which happened ten years earlier when she saw her father being killed by the gang who'd committed the bank robbery. The significance of the 6-digit number then becomes clear, as it's a vital piece of information which could enable the gang to locate the stolen gem.Sean Bean gives a strong performance as the vicious gang leader and powerfully projects just how cold, clever and threatening his character really is. The way that he uses surveillance equipment to watch Dr Conrad's family before and after Jessie's abduction is also very scary as it quickly becomes clear that the gang can see everything that the family do at all times and Conrad's wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) is particularly vulnerable as she's bedridden with a broken leg.Michael Douglas is typically polished as an ordinary professional man who loves his family and then becomes desperate and fearful when his daughter's life is threatened and he's given an absurdly tight deadline within which to meet the criminals' unreasonable demands.Britanny Murphy is fantastic as the mentally disturbed teenager with a history of having violent outbursts and patterns of behaviour that have puzzled the professionals for some years. The power and intensity that she brings to the part is surprisingly strong and believable and makes her performance one that's definitely not to be missed.

Don't Say a Word takes a great concept and, at least for a pretty good amount of the movie, runs with it with style and suspense.  The concept- a psychiatrist (Michael Douglas, good in this type of role) meets a (semi) catatonic girl, but then find himself in a dangerous situation when a kidnapper (Sean Bean) takes his daughter right out of his house and demands he get an important number locked inside the girl's memory.  Sometimes contains scenes that could've been left for the DVD deleted scenes (Oliver Platt, while he's good, serves no real perpose in the core of the story). But when it gets exciting, it can hold your attention well enough.  Murphy, who plays the girl, is off and on believable and over-believable. B+

Don't Say A Word is in many ways a run-of-the-mill thriller. Michael Douglas and Famke Jannsen play a middle-class urban couple with a cute young daughter and the perfect American life. Douglas plays Dr. Nathan Conrad, a respected psychiatrist. On the day before Thanksgiving their lives are turned upside down when their daughter is kidnapped. The kidnappers don't want money, as such; they want Dr. Conrad's services. If he wants to see his daughter again, he must convince a psychiatric patient to reveal a long-kept secret.Director Gary Fleder (Kiss the Girls) owes a few debts here. This film borrows plot devices from Ransom, Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Negotiator, and What Lies Beneath. The biggest flaws of the film are its over-reliance on cliches and some grand implausibilities. The cliches are integrated well enough into they story line that they tend to work for the most part. The one exception has to do with a disappearing body. I saw it coming a mile away. Implausibility is not a fatal flaw in a film, but this one clearly pushes the limits with unanswered questions. One example that doesn't reveal too much will make the point. The villain has waited ten years to get this information, but gives Dr. Conrad a few hours. Sometimes implausible plot points are necessary to get where we want to go; this one seems to be a result of sheer laziness.In spite of these flaws, the film is not without redeeming value. The pacing of the film is nearly flawless, and the director does an excellent job with the editing and visual elements of the film. Performances are solid and occasionally inspired. Particularly noteworthy are the performances by the hero (Michael Douglas) and the villain (Sean Bean who played a similar type in Patriot Games). Skye McCole Bartesiak does an excellent job as the kidnapped daughter and Brittany Murphy is excellent as the psychiatric patient. This film was number one at the box office this past weekend and will probably continue to do well. It is not a great film; it might be a moderately good film. If audiences keep coming it will most likely be for the therapeutic value. Like most crime films and many Westerns, this film presents a model family whose lives are disrupted by a seemingly random act of violence. We sit on the edges of out seats and watch hopefully, as order is restored and good triumphs over evil. This is a message that touches our deepest longings for order and justice, and this is a message we long to hear, perhaps now more than ever.

Ever see a movie for the first time yet still have to ask yourself, "Wait, have I seen this before?" That's pretty much what we're dealing with here. Even if you haven't seen this movie yet, you have.With "Don't Say a Word," it's like whoever made it was so enthralled by the high-concept, give-it-to-me-in-ten-words-or-less premise, they figured they didn't have to try real hard with anything else. Sure, it's competent. But with its intriguing premise, it should have advanced way past that.Oh well. It doesn't. Michael Douglas -- who in this film is wearing more make-up than the "women" I see on Santa Monica Blvd. at midnight -- puts in the kind of performance that, if this were an office job, wouldn't get him fired but wouldn't get him promoted. It's more than a drive-by paycheck pick-up, but Douglas has been around long enough to size up a script and know when he should bother trying and when he shouldn't. He goes with choice B here. And it doesn't really matter.(As a side note, when is the last time Michael Douglas had an on-screen wife within 20 years of his own age? I mean, come on. Do you really think that in real life the man could...oh, wait, never mind.)As for everything else, Brittany Murphy scores some points for playing a schizophrenic disaster of a girl who you'd still like to nail. Oliver Platt, who is getting fatter faster than Aretha Franklin, shows up for some day player-level acting work. Famke Jannsen looks sexy in a cast, but isn't given much to do. And as for the cop, played by Jennifer Esposito, she is so irrelevant to the plot that she's practically in a different movie altogether.The plot? If you can't figure out how this movie ends, you're trying even less than whoever wrote it.Having said all that, it will still kill two free hours just fine. Little ventured, nothing gained.

This movie, starring Michael Douglas as Nathan Conrad, a prominent psychiatrist as a man who must retrieve a number from a patient in order to save his adorable kidnapped daughter, probably should win some sort of award for Dumbest Movie Title. It ranks up there with Don't Look in the Basement, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, and Don't Tell Her It's Me (all real titles). The title's not terribly descriptive, but it fits in with the plotline itself, which is pretty faceless.Douglas must be used to these roles by now, the domineering, I'm-in-charge, alpha male. He's played a powerful lawyer (Disclosure), a powerful financial genius (The Game), a powerful drug czar (Traffic), and the powerful leader of the free world (The American President). He basically sleepwalks through this movie, phoning in a pretty lethargic performance that adds no nuance to the character.In fact, the movie's a lot like Mercury Rising, which starred Bruce Willis as a renegade FBI agent protecting an autistic boy who had broken a supersecret government code. Will Nathan get the code from his traumatized patient in time to save his girl's life? With this type of movie, that question's no more than pure rhetoric. If you're at Point A and can see where the end of the movie (Point B) is, then the only way the movie can distinguish itself is to provide a gimmick. That gimmick is that the code that these evil bad guys (led by a superficially menacing Sean Bean) need is locked in the screwed-up mind of Elisabeth Burrows (newcomer Brittney Murphy), who isn't autistic but is so traumatized by the murder of her father years ago that she hardly speaks to anyone and reacts violently when approached. On top of all of this, Nathan's stock pretty wife Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak, looking like Sela Ward) is stuck in their apartment with a broken leg. (And you know, when a character has something slightly off-kilter about them, that quirkiness will play a role in the movie, somehow. It's like when a guy has a lisp - and then it turns out that the bad guy has a lisp, too. These things are hardly ever put in for no reason, you see.)Once we've established that the Bad Guys have the daughter and that the wife is stuck in bed with a cast, then we know Nathan must solve it on his own. To make sure, the Bad Guys tell him not to go to the cops. They don't need to say this, though; the Hero never goes to the cops. Too dangerous. Who'd believe him? And so on. So our stalwart, prominent psychiatrist goes it alone, for only he may save the day. Snore.Maybe it's Douglas, and maybe it's the shallowness of the supporting cast, but in so many of his movies the other actors seem to melt away. Sometimes it's because he's off the wall, a ham who doesn't chew the scenary so much as swallow it hole and regurgitate it onto your TV. (It's the Michael Douglas show! No wait; that was a different Mike Douglas.)The wonderful thing about characters with mental issues is that you can make those problems do whatever the script requires, with no real nod to logic or cohesion. These characters can be manipulated to fit any plot stupidities, including the dopey actions of the main characters. Don't Say a Word falls easily into this mold. And any movie that leans heavily on one gimmick isn't much of a movie, unless the characterizations and performances are well above par for the genre. They're not.This is drivel best relegated to the bargain bins at Blockbuster. From start to finish, there's not one true note to be found. Suspend your disbelief? You need to suspend it and then kick the chair out from underneath it. This movie doesn't approach credibility; it's a mere tourist in the land of reality.

This movie provides in the thrills department. It stars Michael Douglas in the lead role (and he IS well cast) as a psychiatrist whose daughter is kidnapped by a bunch of men who want him to extract a six-digit number from a mentally disturbed young lady. Both parties then proceed to match wits en route to a great climax towards the end of the movie.This was based on the book by the same name. The book was quite good, too. I rank this movie as your typical thriller with good twists.
*** out of ****

Highly overdone thriller with a slew of sub-plots that confuse instead of enhance the story that in the end seems like a big wast of time, unless you see it for it's unintentional comedic values.A bank robbery ten years ago in Brooklyn NY to steal an expensive ruby from a safe deposit box goes astray when one of the crooks ends up stealing it from his fellow robbers. A short time later strolling with his eight year old daughter, Elisabeth (Brittany Murphy) on the subway he's chased beaten and thrown to the tracks, by the crooks whom he double-crossed, where he's then run over by a train and killed before the eyes of his terrified daughter. Just before Elisabeth's dad is buried in Potter's Field his daughter puts her doll, Miska, in the Coffin with him not knowing that he hid the sought after ruby in it. Ten years later the crooks who killed her father, who were arrested on the scene and sentenced, are released from jail. The first thing that they do is go looking for Elisabeth to get the number of the grave that here father is buried in to get a hold of the ruby. Now how does Michael Douglas, Dr. Nathan Conrad, come in to all this? It seems that Dr. Conrad is a top hot shot psychiatrist who's associated with the mental hospital where Elisabeth is a patient. This is after she recognized one of the crooks who killed her father and went bananas and slashed him to death.The crooks want Dr. Conrad to find out from Elisabeth the number of her fathers grave by him getting her to talk to him. To make sure that Dr. Conrad cooperates they kidnap his eight year old daughter Jessie, Skye McCole, so that he gets the massage. The movie "Don't say a word" goes on with at least a dozen more sub-plots that would take a good size book to explain them all. The final scene in Potter's Field goes on for what seems to be an eternity.Under normal conditions you should have concern and sympathy for Dr. Conrad his wife and daughter, as well as young Elisabeth, but you just can't. The movie is so contrived that the characters didn't seem real so why even bother to care about them. The most absurd part in the movie, with so many absurd parts, was the hard as nails, all pampered and polished, detective Sandra Cassidy, Jennifer Esposito. Cassidy in the end of the film takes on the whole batch of hardened criminals single-handedly without even bothering to call or wait for back-up. Even "Dirty Harry" Callahan wouldn't do that and ends up wiping out almost all of them! even after taking a bullet in her gut! Cassidy is so though that she seems ready to get back on duty the next morning! And to think that there are some people who say that women can't cut it as policemen.

Gary Fleder's Don't Say A Word is a slightly topical and generic thriller that slickly goes through the motions to give us a result that is entertaining, if nothing special. The late Brittany Murphy plays Elizabeth, a disturbed young girl who resides in a psychiatric facility, haunted by a violent past trauma, unable to cope or communicate. A decade earlier, she witnessed her father brutally murdered by a group of jewel thieves, bent on finding out the location of a priceless gem he hid somewhere. Michael Douglas plays Nathan Conrad, the psychiatrist tasked with unlocking the secrets of Elizabeth's mind. The trouble arises when Patrick Koster (Sean Bean), leader of the thieves, catches on and promptly kidnaps Conrad's daughter (Sky McCole, RIP) as leverage to find the whereabouts of the jewel. A tense game of cat, mouse and killer ensues as Bean's crew basically terrorizes Douglas's family. Murphy gives the best performance as the damaged teenager fighting tooth and nail to suppress the horror of times past. Douglas makes a solid protagonist and desperate father, struggling to protect his daughter and wife (Famke Janssen) whilst in the midst of crisis. Bean carries the villain role nicely, never moustache twirling yet maintaining the menace terrifically and holding his end up. There's supporting work from Oliver Platt, David Warshofsky, Victor Argo, Jennifer Esposito, Shawn Doyle and Aiden Devine as well. It's standard thriller territory, helped nicely by its cast and given an extra shot of quality by Brittany Murphy's superb work.

When talking about "Don't say a word", the main thing I recall is that this thriller wasn't that thrilling.  I can honestly say that the advertising for this movie was more entertaining than the actual film.  The roles were well acted, but the plot moved along at a snails pace.  When the plot finally did move along, there was no excitement in finally finding out what was going on.** out of **** ....oh. ...and the cop was highly annoying.

"Don't Say a Word", is the perfect example of good idea gone cliche.  It is the story of a successful psychiatrist forced to retrieve important information from the mind of a patient in order to save his daughter's life.     Michael Douglas plays Dr. Nathan Conrad, psychiatrist, husband and father.  He agrees to take on a colleague's case , with no idea what's in store for him and his family.  Soon after meeting his patient Elisabeth(Brittany Murphy), his young daughter is abducted.  To get his daughter back, he must convince Elisabeth to reveal six important numbers that will lead the abductors to a jewel worth ten million dollars.  To raise the stakes, Conrad is given until 5pm the same day to do it. No problem!I can't help but be disappointed, because this could have been a really enjoyable movie.  All of the pieces were in place, a strong premise and good actors (Michael Douglas, Famke Janssen, Oliver Platt and Brittany Murphy who I had never heard of until now).  Unfortunately it also had every Hollywood cliche except for the token "take time for gratuitous sex".  It could have been so much more.I was disappointed that a girl being so afraid and unstable in the beginning could be won over so quickly.  I don't care how charming Michael Douglas is (and he must be exceptionally charming to marry Catherine Zeta), the movie should have spent much more time with him struggling to get through to Elisabeth.  I loved watching her in the beginning with her "I'll never tell" that you've probably seen in all of the previews.  Unfortunately they spent too little time with Douglas and Murphy in combating roles, and too much with Douglas as her father figure.I also love Oliver Platt.  He is great in everything he does.  Unfortunately here he only does it for the first half of the movie.  Apparently he had somewhere else to be for the second half of shooting, because he was basically dropped from the movie at the mid-way point, along with his entire story line.  Use him or lose him, just don't do it half way through a movie!Finally, we have a cop who is a waste of space.  Take her off the screen, use that screen time to expand Dr. Conrad's time appealing to his patient, and then you'd have had a really interesting movie.Overall, it isn't a bad movie.  It just isn't as good as it could have been either.  Save it for cheap movie night, don't get your hopes up for anything original, and enjoy the performances (especially Brittany Murphy).  Dr.'s orders.

I didn't watch this movie when it first came out over 20 years ago because of the negative reviews. However, I decided to watch it last night, and I was surprised how good it is.The cast is excellent: Brittany Murphy gives a stellar performance as a girl who witnessed her father's murder ten years before. Sean Bean is one of the best British actors, and plays a hero or a villain equally well. Michael Douglas and Famke Janssen also perform very well as always.There is plenty of suspense throughout, and the movie is neither too slow paced, nor too fast paced. There is sufficient character development to make the characters interesting.There is nothing wrong with the acting, screenwriting nor direction. The harsh reviews make no sense.

.... Is what DON'T SAY A WORD screamed at me in the opening heist sequence . This is very true to life , thieves stab each other in the back and once they're caught it's a race to turn stool pigeon and make a deal with the DA. However after the opening robbery we're treated to the domestic life of hero shrink Nathan Conrad . Cheer as Nathan tucks his daughter into bed , weep with awe as Nathan gives his wife a blanket bath , gasp in amazement as Nathan shows the audience his culinary skills in the kitchen , but don't worry the story does improve when Mr Bean and the bad boys reappear in the story ***** MILD SPOILERS *****As said the story does pick up here but your attention is drawn to some gaping plot holes . The bad guys have set up CCTV cameras in Nathan's home and have also bugged a patient's room at the local psychiatric hospital . Actually this is later explained so they're not necessarily plot holes but your attention is drawn to these details at the time so they certainly play out as holes in the plot . You also have to suspend your belief that the Bean boys can break into Nathan's flat and kidnap his daughter without Mr&Mrs Conrad noticing anything or hearing anything , but there is a massive gap in logic at the climax of the movie . The bad guys need a number from Elisabeth a patient of Nathan's and it transpires that Elisabeth is the daughter of the robber who ripped off the gang at the start of the movie and the number they're after is the number of a grave where both her father and a jewel is hidden . We're shown via flash back the gang catching up with the father killing him and then being arrested , and it's after this that Elisabeth puts the jewel hidden inside her dolly into her father's grave . Now if Elisabeth did this AFTER the gang had been arrested how would the bad guys know the number is related to a grave when they've all been in custody before , during and after the burial ? Doesn't make sense does it ?DON'T SAY A WORD is a disappointment mainly down to the run of the mill script which is a shame because a film with Michael Douglas playing a good guy and Sean Bean a bad guy should be a sure fire hit . Douglas and Bean and the rest of the cast do try to rise above the material but there's not much material to rise above in the first place

They say there's nothing new under the sun, and that's especially apt in sunny Hollywood.  So it's tempting to ask, merely as a theoretical exercise, "can you make a movie that is essentially a model kit assembled from other movies, and still make it effective?"  "Don't Say a Word" proves that the answer is "Yes."  WHY you would want to set out to do such a thing is another question; you'll have to ask the producers about it.In the movie, Michael Douglas plays an affluent, happily married psychologist who has to contend (as Michael Douglas does in every movie), with a seriously disturbed woman.  The femme-looney in this outing is Elizabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), a 10-year, 20-institution veteran with enough contradictory diagnoses to sink a DSM textbook.  He is called in to consult by a colleague (Oliver Platt) and then is bewildered as a shadowy band of Bad Guys snatch his daughter and demand that he work his famed empathy thing with poor Britt and get her to give him a ten-digit number that they need.  Her dad, it seems, ripped them off during the heist of a precious red jewel, and they need the number to find it.  Douglas figures out that while she has problems of her own, Elizabeth has been confounding her doctors by imitating various symptoms, in effect, staying institutionalized to hide from the evildoers.  Me, I would have gone to Tahiti; to each his own.The kidnap-flick tropes then come in fast and heavy: the Panicked Discovery, the Initial Phone Call, The List of Rules (no cops, yada yada), "No Deal Til I Talk to My Daughter", the Desperate Clock-Race Across Town, the Tough Female Detective trying to Figure It All Out, and more.  We get a host of other familiar faces, too: the Bad Guys are a band of high-tech thieves (which are so common in movies, they must have a hell of a union), with black leather jackets, sleek laptops, and a guy whose job during the robbery is to stand in the middle of the bank with a stopwatch calling off the time, as though they were at the Olympic trials for the 100-meter Felony.But all this is skillfully handled, with just enough tweaks to the familiar formulas to make it feel fresh.  At one point, Douglas makes the kidnappers relocate to meet him, a nice twist on the usual "kidnappers run the bagman all over town" scene.  And the bit with the mental patient, well, it beats can-we-raise-the-money-in-time?  For his part, Michael Douglas does well, though he is a little too slick to portray besieged decent men.  My hunch is that Harrison Ford was first choice to play this role.  Famke Janssen is good as his wife.  Though the script gives her little to do, she is really the one who makes us feel the panic and despair that attend the abduction of a child, and though it's a familiar movie scenario, it is still able to play on the nerves quite effectively.  The little girl playing Douglas' daughter does well, too, cute but not cloying, smart but credible; there is an amusing scene where she attempts to make conversation with the hulking, tattooed murderer who is guarding her, eventually cajoling him into making peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches.  And, carrying on the proud tradition started by Alyssa Milano in "Commando", does her level best to foil her captors.The Bad Guys are a little disappointing.  They are assigned quirks rather than characters (one never appears to have a name).  As the head villain, Sean Bean makes what he can of his feral charisma, but he literally phones this performance in.  I think the poor guy is doomed to spend the rest of his career playing Hibernian heavies in leather jackets.  Their operation seems a little too well-orchestrated, especially since the movie supposedly take place less than three weeks after they've been sprung after doing a dime in Attica (where one guesses they studied electronic eavesdropping in between lifting weights).  And while the movie doesn't say how much the priceless rock is worth, by my estimation, after splitting the proceeds and covering their overhead, surveillance equipment, and tattoos, the gang should have just enough left for a celebratory lunch at the IHOP.The best performance is by Brittany Murphy as the twitchy, wary Elizabeth. With her weird hand gestures and tuneless singing, this character could have been really annoying.  But Murphy makes her guileless and affecting. Watching her stare out her barred window at the tugboats in the river, your heart breaks just a little.The story is not always credible, especially the parts involving Jennifer Esposito as the detective, who is really a sideshow anyway.  We also see several New Yorkers who are surprisingly pliant when deprived of everything from cell phones to speedboats.  And the parents adhere blindly to the "don't tell the cops" rule, even after it is laughably impractical to do so.
The thing that really makes the movie work is the setting and the way it is shot by director Gary Fleder, who made the underrated "Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead".  Fleder puts us in claustophobic, oppressive places, from underground morgues to puke-green institution hallways with prison doors and disturbing graffiti, to the fog-shrouded darkness of Potter's Field, graveyard of the anonymous dead of New York City.  Even Douglas' luxury apartment seems at tight quarters, and these places are filmed in such a way to make this close to a horror movie.  The dark climax is formulaic, but give a neat twist in location.  The number, incidentally, doesn't refer to an uplink code or satellite designation or encryption key or any of the usual millenial McGuffins of late.  What it represents is something surprising, sad, and refreshingly old-fashioned.  Which kind of goes for the rest of the movie as well.

Overall, I really liked this movie, which surprised me a little bit. The trailers I had seen for it had me thinking it was going to be kind of "cheesy" for lack of a better word, but this was actually very engrossing. It had an interesting story line, sustained suspense and for the most part was well acted.I particularly liked Brittany Murphy as Elisabeth Burrows, the psychiatric inmate whose tortured mind holds the information that Dr. Conrad (Michael Douglas) needs to get in order to save his young daughter Jessie's (Skye McCole Bartusiak) life. Murphy seemed so "into" her character that it was almost spooky to watch her. She was extremely convincing. Douglas I thought also offered up a good performance, as did Sean Bean as Patrick, the head kidnapper. Young Miss Bartusiak was commendable but to me didn't seem to portray the range of emotions I would expect a young child to be feeling in Jesse's circumstances. She just seemed altogether too calm. The same could be said for Famke Janssen as Jessie's mother Aggie Conrad. I realize the character had a broken leg and apparently couldn't get out of bed, but again she just seemed to take the whole thing too calmly (and, when her own life was threatened she seemed able to move around well enough, broken leg or not!) As for Oliver Platt as Conrad's colleague Dr. Sachs? I find that, depending on the movie, I either like Platt or don't (no middle ground) and I didn't care for him in this movie.Overall, though, the movie was quite good as a vehicle for Douglas. I'd rate it as a 7/10.

Here's another interesting kidnap story. Sean Bean always plays a believable villain and Michael Douglas usually plays roles that keep the audience's attention....so the almost- two hours go by pretty quickly. The whole cast, actually, pretty good with no one person standing out.The story loses points because the ending goes on too long and has the standard villain-holds-the-gun-and-doesn't shoot-too long clich√© which drives critics, me included crazy. That, and a bit too many f-words in here by the female cop (Jennifer Esposito) which simply aren't necessary, and a few other holes all reduce this from a sure 9-star to an "8.....but don't misunderstand: it's worth a look.

A sad, unfortunate fact about this movie is that the 2 young female stars Brittany Murphy and Skye McCole Bartusiak (who plays the daughter of Michael Douglas) both died in a young age.Anyway, this is a conventional thriller, nothing extraordinary. Although the critics hated it, it manage to become a commercial success doubling its budget in box office.The plot is flimsy and fragile: The daughter of a psychiatrist is kidnapped, and her kidnappers want from his to "extract" a secret from a young woman who is imprisoned in a mental institution, that could lead them to a valuable object they tried to stole some years ago.It starts slow but soon some action picks-up but it becomes exaggerated and coincidental maybe even absurd.Michael Douglas does what he cans to save the movie but doesn't seem enough.Overall: If you can catch it on TV watch it, but never think of paying a single dollar/euro/whatever for it.

My 11 year old nephew said it was the scariest movie he's ever seen.  I can't quite agree with that, but the level of intensity and the fast moving plot really impressed me, even if it all didn't quite add up in the end.  I can't remember a movie that I've seen in awhile that just MOVED along so well and had so little downtime. Given the 'deadline', it felt like it was in real-time for the second half of the movie. I was a little bothered by Michael Douglas having a wife the age of Famke. I love her and its not a knock against her but there was no need to keep up Douglas' legacy of attracting wives under 35 for him.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Demi Moore and Daryl Hannah have all been love interests for him - why?  Because its the male fantasy?  Reeks of insecurity to me.  Plus I don't see Dame Judi Dench romancing Leo, do I?  Meryl Streep and James Franco?  Anyway, this is not important, just slightly annoying.  There are questions I'd like to ask the screenwriter because there are inconsistencies along the way and about one or two things that are totally out of the question.  However, as I mentioned, the movie moves along so fast that you might not have time to dwell on anything for too long. I don't think it was speeded up to cover anything up either.  The best part is the acting, especially by Brittany Murphy.  I didn't enjoy her in "Clueless" but really loved her in "Girl Interupted" and thought she was the best thing about that movie.  Here she gives it all, in a part that could have been laughed off the screen if it weren't played exactly right. Jennifer Esposito is also very believable as a cop, Sean Bean as a kidnapper and, as mentioned, Famke as a trophy wife.  Worth watching, for sure.  7/10.

This thriller certainly is a good enough one to watch and it also is a very professionally made one but it however offers very little new or refreshing enough material. It makes "Don't Say a Word" nothing more than a standard thriller, with some good actors in it.The cast is really the saving grace of the movie. It still provides the movie with some good moments and characters and also give the movie an extra sense of professionalism involved. Sean Bean is a great as the main villain and delivers an absolute fine performance. Michael Douglas is also great as the leading man, mainly because he doesn't play him as an 'hero' but an ordinary everyday person instead. Douglas is always fine in these sort of roles. Some other excellent actors play some smaller parts in the movie. Actors such as; Brittany Murphy, Oliver Platt, Victor Argo and last but not least Famke Janssen. They all help to make the movie look better and more interesting than it in fact really is. Most of the characters are however pretty flat. Why does Famke Janssen even play the wife? It's a role basically every actress could had played. This movie just didn't seem like a very challenging or original project to get involved with. And I also have the feeling that the movie would had been better of without the Jennifer Esposito. Just think about it, was she really necessary for the movie and its story? Her character is not engaging enough, since it's not she we need to care about or cheer for but the Michael Douglas character instead, who is the main lead of the movie. Her character is distracting from the movie its main story.The movie is certainly style-full and it does have its moments. But in the end it just really falls flat as a really good or original thriller. All of the moments in the movie are just too predictable and the movie doesn't offer any real surprises. Therefor this movie just isn't anymore than a well made but standard formulaic thriller.It's a movie that does serve its purpose and the movie certainly is watchable as a simple standard thriller. Fans of the genre will probably still be the most entertained by it but even they have to conclude that this movie is far from being one of the best thrillers released in recent years. It's the sort of movie that is only quite good enough to watch it just maybe once. Don't expect too much of this and you might end up liking it good enough.Nothing too remarkable, just a well made, simple thriller, with some great actors in it.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

"Don't Say A Word" is an entertaining "race against time" thriller with plenty of action, some good acting and a few neat twists. Visually, it's easy on the eye and its plot involves bank robbery, murder and kidnapping as well as an ordinary man who has to do something extraordinary in order to save the life of his child. The stakes are high and the tension grows steadily until things become even more desperate as time starts to run out. Interestingly, the story has a few different strands which eventually converge and the pace of the action is lively throughout.A gang breaks into a bank and steals just one high value item (a gem worth $10 million) but after making a clean getaway, it's soon discovered that one of the criminals has double-crossed his associates and has absconded with the jewel. The other gang members then hunt him down and kill him in a subway station.Ten years later, after having served their time in prison, the gang kidnap the 8-year-old daughter of Dr Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas) who's a highly respected New York psychiatrist. Conrad is a specialist in dealing with teenage patients and the kidnappers demand that he elicit from one of his patients a 6-digit number which is buried somewhere in her troubled mind. Jessie Conrad (Skye McCole Bartusiak) is abducted early in the morning of Thanksgiving Day and Dr Conrad is given until 5.00pm to get the necessary information. If he fails Jessie will be killed.Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy) is a particularly challenging patient who has been institutionalised for many years and has displayed a confusing variety of symptoms. Conrad eventually gains her cooperation when he tells her that his daughter has been kidnapped and through his efforts, it's gradually discovered that her trauma originated in an incident, which happened ten years earlier when she saw her father being killed by the gang who'd committed the bank robbery. The significance of the 6-digit number then becomes clear, as it's a vital piece of information which could enable the gang to locate the stolen gem.Sean Bean gives a strong performance as the vicious gang leader and powerfully projects just how cold, clever and threatening his character really is. The way that he uses surveillance equipment to watch Dr Conrad's family before and after Jessie's abduction is also very scary as it quickly becomes clear that the gang can see everything that the family do at all times and Conrad's wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) is particularly vulnerable as she's bedridden with a broken leg.Michael Douglas is typically polished as an ordinary professional man who loves his family and then becomes desperate and fearful when his daughter's life is threatened and he's given an absurdly tight deadline within which to meet the criminals' unreasonable demands.Britanny Murphy is fantastic as the mentally disturbed teenager with a history of having violent outbursts and patterns of behaviour that have puzzled the professionals for some years. The power and intensity that she brings to the part is surprisingly strong and believable and makes her performance one that's definitely not to be missed.

Don't Say a Word takes a great concept and, at least for a pretty good amount of the movie, runs with it with style and suspense.  The concept- a psychiatrist (Michael Douglas, good in this type of role) meets a (semi) catatonic girl, but then find himself in a dangerous situation when a kidnapper (Sean Bean) takes his daughter right out of his house and demands he get an important number locked inside the girl's memory.  Sometimes contains scenes that could've been left for the DVD deleted scenes (Oliver Platt, while he's good, serves no real perpose in the core of the story). But when it gets exciting, it can hold your attention well enough.  Murphy, who plays the girl, is off and on believable and over-believable. B+

Don't Say A Word is in many ways a run-of-the-mill thriller. Michael Douglas and Famke Jannsen play a middle-class urban couple with a cute young daughter and the perfect American life. Douglas plays Dr. Nathan Conrad, a respected psychiatrist. On the day before Thanksgiving their lives are turned upside down when their daughter is kidnapped. The kidnappers don't want money, as such; they want Dr. Conrad's services. If he wants to see his daughter again, he must convince a psychiatric patient to reveal a long-kept secret.Director Gary Fleder (Kiss the Girls) owes a few debts here. This film borrows plot devices from Ransom, Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Negotiator, and What Lies Beneath. The biggest flaws of the film are its over-reliance on cliches and some grand implausibilities. The cliches are integrated well enough into they story line that they tend to work for the most part. The one exception has to do with a disappearing body. I saw it coming a mile away. Implausibility is not a fatal flaw in a film, but this one clearly pushes the limits with unanswered questions. One example that doesn't reveal too much will make the point. The villain has waited ten years to get this information, but gives Dr. Conrad a few hours. Sometimes implausible plot points are necessary to get where we want to go; this one seems to be a result of sheer laziness.In spite of these flaws, the film is not without redeeming value. The pacing of the film is nearly flawless, and the director does an excellent job with the editing and visual elements of the film. Performances are solid and occasionally inspired. Particularly noteworthy are the performances by the hero (Michael Douglas) and the villain (Sean Bean who played a similar type in Patriot Games). Skye McCole Bartesiak does an excellent job as the kidnapped daughter and Brittany Murphy is excellent as the psychiatric patient. This film was number one at the box office this past weekend and will probably continue to do well. It is not a great film; it might be a moderately good film. If audiences keep coming it will most likely be for the therapeutic value. Like most crime films and many Westerns, this film presents a model family whose lives are disrupted by a seemingly random act of violence. We sit on the edges of out seats and watch hopefully, as order is restored and good triumphs over evil. This is a message that touches our deepest longings for order and justice, and this is a message we long to hear, perhaps now more than ever.

A thriller with some decent acting and an OK story. I'll bet the book is a lot better; the movie has to compress all the therapy sessions b/n Michael Douglas and Brittany Murphy's characters, which makes them feel rushed.Visually, there isn't much that pops off the screen. I did like the female cop character, and the daughter Jessie was a very smooth actor for a kid.Really, the thing that kept it all from taking off, IMO, is that everything always seemed to work out too perfectly: the father knows the name of the dolls (that never happens :-); the patient never panics or runs away while being transported out of a hospital for the first time in 10 years; the cop locates the bad guys on Hart Island just in time, etc...She gets blasted thru with multiple gunshots, yet has a smile for Douglas at the ambulance...Perhaps the question that sticks in my mind most is: Why did the good guys show so much mercy to the bad guys? It cost them every time. I kept yelling at my screen "Kill him!", but they never would...then the bad guy would rise again.***LUKEWARM RECOMMENDATION***

Ever see a movie for the first time yet still have to ask yourself, "Wait, have I seen this before?" That's pretty much what we're dealing with here. Even if you haven't seen this movie yet, you have.With "Don't Say a Word," it's like whoever made it was so enthralled by the high-concept, give-it-to-me-in-ten-words-or-less premise, they figured they didn't have to try real hard with anything else. Sure, it's competent. But with its intriguing premise, it should have advanced way past that.Oh well. It doesn't. Michael Douglas -- who in this film is wearing more make-up than the "women" I see on Santa Monica Blvd. at midnight -- puts in the kind of performance that, if this were an office job, wouldn't get him fired but wouldn't get him promoted. It's more than a drive-by paycheck pick-up, but Douglas has been around long enough to size up a script and know when he should bother trying and when he shouldn't. He goes with choice B here. And it doesn't really matter.(As a side note, when is the last time Michael Douglas had an on-screen wife within 20 years of his own age? I mean, come on. Do you really think that in real life the man could...oh, wait, never mind.)As for everything else, Brittany Murphy scores some points for playing a schizophrenic disaster of a girl who you'd still like to nail. Oliver Platt, who is getting fatter faster than Aretha Franklin, shows up for some day player-level acting work. Famke Jannsen looks sexy in a cast, but isn't given much to do. And as for the cop, played by Jennifer Esposito, she is so irrelevant to the plot that she's practically in a different movie altogether.The plot? If you can't figure out how this movie ends, you're trying even less than whoever wrote it.Having said all that, it will still kill two free hours just fine. Little ventured, nothing gained.

I really don't understand the bad reviews and low rating! This movie is totally underrated! It's a really good thriller with interesting psychological aspect to it. Michael Douglas, Sean Bean and Brittany Murphy are all Excellent! Maybe it's not too innovative (it's a typical "we kidnapped someone you love and now you do as we say") but so what?! It's interesting and suspenseful and 20 years later it's still working! If you never watched it and you like good thrillers, give it a chance!

The all star cast delivers, Michael Douglas, Brittany Murphy, Sean Bean, etc. all put in really solid performances.The story is fresh and is pretty well thought out, Douglas is a psychiatrist whose daughter has been kidnapped - but the perpetrators don't want money, they want him to get a six digit code from the troubled mind of a mental teenager (Brittany Murphy) or they kill his only child.There's plenty of tension and drama in the race to get the number and save his child, with some decent action thrown in.Don't say a word really should be a great film based on the positives listed above, but it seems the whole equals less than the sum of its parts and it just comes out as average.6/10

This movie, starring Michael Douglas as Nathan Conrad, a prominent psychiatrist as a man who must retrieve a number from a patient in order to save his adorable kidnapped daughter, probably should win some sort of award for Dumbest Movie Title. It ranks up there with Don't Look in the Basement, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, and Don't Tell Her It's Me (all real titles). The title's not terribly descriptive, but it fits in with the plotline itself, which is pretty faceless.Douglas must be used to these roles by now, the domineering, I'm-in-charge, alpha male. He's played a powerful lawyer (Disclosure), a powerful financial genius (The Game), a powerful drug czar (Traffic), and the powerful leader of the free world (The American President). He basically sleepwalks through this movie, phoning in a pretty lethargic performance that adds no nuance to the character.In fact, the movie's a lot like Mercury Rising, which starred Bruce Willis as a renegade FBI agent protecting an autistic boy who had broken a supersecret government code. Will Nathan get the code from his traumatized patient in time to save his girl's life? With this type of movie, that question's no more than pure rhetoric. If you're at Point A and can see where the end of the movie (Point B) is, then the only way the movie can distinguish itself is to provide a gimmick. That gimmick is that the code that these evil bad guys (led by a superficially menacing Sean Bean) need is locked in the screwed-up mind of Elisabeth Burrows (newcomer Brittney Murphy), who isn't autistic but is so traumatized by the murder of her father years ago that she hardly speaks to anyone and reacts violently when approached. On top of all of this, Nathan's stock pretty wife Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak, looking like Sela Ward) is stuck in their apartment with a broken leg. (And you know, when a character has something slightly off-kilter about them, that quirkiness will play a role in the movie, somehow. It's like when a guy has a lisp - and then it turns out that the bad guy has a lisp, too. These things are hardly ever put in for no reason, you see.)Once we've established that the Bad Guys have the daughter and that the wife is stuck in bed with a cast, then we know Nathan must solve it on his own. To make sure, the Bad Guys tell him not to go to the cops. They don't need to say this, though; the Hero never goes to the cops. Too dangerous. Who'd believe him? And so on. So our stalwart, prominent psychiatrist goes it alone, for only he may save the day. Snore.Maybe it's Douglas, and maybe it's the shallowness of the supporting cast, but in so many of his movies the other actors seem to melt away. Sometimes it's because he's off the wall, a ham who doesn't chew the scenary so much as swallow it hole and regurgitate it onto your TV. (It's the Michael Douglas show! No wait; that was a different Mike Douglas.)The wonderful thing about characters with mental issues is that you can make those problems do whatever the script requires, with no real nod to logic or cohesion. These characters can be manipulated to fit any plot stupidities, including the dopey actions of the main characters. Don't Say a Word falls easily into this mold. And any movie that leans heavily on one gimmick isn't much of a movie, unless the characterizations and performances are well above par for the genre. They're not.This is drivel best relegated to the bargain bins at Blockbuster. From start to finish, there's not one true note to be found. Suspend your disbelief? You need to suspend it and then kick the chair out from underneath it. This movie doesn't approach credibility; it's a mere tourist in the land of reality.

This movie provides in the thrills department. It stars Michael Douglas in the lead role (and he IS well cast) as a psychiatrist whose daughter is kidnapped by a bunch of men who want him to extract a six-digit number from a mentally disturbed young lady. Both parties then proceed to match wits en route to a great climax towards the end of the movie.This was based on the book by the same name. The book was quite good, too. I rank this movie as your typical thriller with good twists.
*** out of ****

Quite a decent thriller, with Michael Douglas, Sean Bean and Brittany Murphy. Thankfully, Sean keeps his english accent, as some other english actors try their hand at being american, which is fine, but not when you're so used to them.That being said, it starts at the beginnng. Many thrillers have to build up, which at times you lose the thrill of the plot. Then, you're thrown into the present day, and start to understand the characters.It has a few twists, but nothing that really jumped out. If you're after a decent thriller, have a go :)

Highly overdone thriller with a slew of sub-plots that confuse instead of enhance the story that in the end seems like a big wast of time, unless you see it for it's unintentional comedic values.A bank robbery ten years ago in Brooklyn NY to steal an expensive ruby from a safe deposit box goes astray when one of the crooks ends up stealing it from his fellow robbers. A short time later strolling with his eight year old daughter, Elisabeth (Brittany Murphy) on the subway he's chased beaten and thrown to the tracks, by the crooks whom he double-crossed, where he's then run over by a train and killed before the eyes of his terrified daughter. Just before Elisabeth's dad is buried in Potter's Field his daughter puts her doll, Miska, in the Coffin with him not knowing that he hid the sought after ruby in it. Ten years later the crooks who killed her father, who were arrested on the scene and sentenced, are released from jail. The first thing that they do is go looking for Elisabeth to get the number of the grave that here father is buried in to get a hold of the ruby. Now how does Michael Douglas, Dr. Nathan Conrad, come in to all this? It seems that Dr. Conrad is a top hot shot psychiatrist who's associated with the mental hospital where Elisabeth is a patient. This is after she recognized one of the crooks who killed her father and went bananas and slashed him to death.The crooks want Dr. Conrad to find out from Elisabeth the number of her fathers grave by him getting her to talk to him. To make sure that Dr. Conrad cooperates they kidnap his eight year old daughter Jessie, Skye McCole, so that he gets the massage. The movie "Don't say a word" goes on with at least a dozen more sub-plots that would take a good size book to explain them all. The final scene in Potter's Field goes on for what seems to be an eternity.Under normal conditions you should have concern and sympathy for Dr. Conrad his wife and daughter, as well as young Elisabeth, but you just can't. The movie is so contrived that the characters didn't seem real so why even bother to care about them. The most absurd part in the movie, with so many absurd parts, was the hard as nails, all pampered and polished, detective Sandra Cassidy, Jennifer Esposito. Cassidy in the end of the film takes on the whole batch of hardened criminals single-handedly without even bothering to call or wait for back-up. Even "Dirty Harry" Callahan wouldn't do that and ends up wiping out almost all of them! even after taking a bullet in her gut! Cassidy is so though that she seems ready to get back on duty the next morning! And to think that there are some people who say that women can't cut it as policemen.

The sort of thriller at which Michael Douglas excels (though he's looking a little long in the tooth now). This is a well constructed, well acted, beautifullyphotographed thriller. Although there is nothing surprising or unusual, it is a good evening's entertainment.My only complaint is that the main characters played by Michael Douglas, Sean Bean, and Brittany Murphy are so well acted and well written, that the othercharacters - the wife, the policewoman, the daughter - are to some extentsqueezed out. This is a shame, as their performances are excellent.

Gary Fleder's Don't Say A Word is a slightly topical and generic thriller that slickly goes through the motions to give us a result that is entertaining, if nothing special. The late Brittany Murphy plays Elizabeth, a disturbed young girl who resides in a psychiatric facility, haunted by a violent past trauma, unable to cope or communicate. A decade earlier, she witnessed her father brutally murdered by a group of jewel thieves, bent on finding out the location of a priceless gem he hid somewhere. Michael Douglas plays Nathan Conrad, the psychiatrist tasked with unlocking the secrets of Elizabeth's mind. The trouble arises when Patrick Koster (Sean Bean), leader of the thieves, catches on and promptly kidnaps Conrad's daughter (Sky McCole, RIP) as leverage to find the whereabouts of the jewel. A tense game of cat, mouse and killer ensues as Bean's crew basically terrorizes Douglas's family. Murphy gives the best performance as the damaged teenager fighting tooth and nail to suppress the horror of times past. Douglas makes a solid protagonist and desperate father, struggling to protect his daughter and wife (Famke Janssen) whilst in the midst of crisis. Bean carries the villain role nicely, never moustache twirling yet maintaining the menace terrifically and holding his end up. There's supporting work from Oliver Platt, David Warshofsky, Victor Argo, Jennifer Esposito, Shawn Doyle and Aiden Devine as well. It's standard thriller territory, helped nicely by its cast and given an extra shot of quality by Brittany Murphy's superb work.

"Don't Say a Word", is the perfect example of good idea gone cliche.  It is the story of a successful psychiatrist forced to retrieve important information from the mind of a patient in order to save his daughter's life.     Michael Douglas plays Dr. Nathan Conrad, psychiatrist, husband and father.  He agrees to take on a colleague's case , with no idea what's in store for him and his family.  Soon after meeting his patient Elisabeth(Brittany Murphy), his young daughter is abducted.  To get his daughter back, he must convince Elisabeth to reveal six important numbers that will lead the abductors to a jewel worth ten million dollars.  To raise the stakes, Conrad is given until 5pm the same day to do it. No problem!I can't help but be disappointed, because this could have been a really enjoyable movie.  All of the pieces were in place, a strong premise and good actors (Michael Douglas, Famke Janssen, Oliver Platt and Brittany Murphy who I had never heard of until now).  Unfortunately it also had every Hollywood cliche except for the token "take time for gratuitous sex".  It could have been so much more.I was disappointed that a girl being so afraid and unstable in the beginning could be won over so quickly.  I don't care how charming Michael Douglas is (and he must be exceptionally charming to marry Catherine Zeta), the movie should have spent much more time with him struggling to get through to Elisabeth.  I loved watching her in the beginning with her "I'll never tell" that you've probably seen in all of the previews.  Unfortunately they spent too little time with Douglas and Murphy in combating roles, and too much with Douglas as her father figure.I also love Oliver Platt.  He is great in everything he does.  Unfortunately here he only does it for the first half of the movie.  Apparently he had somewhere else to be for the second half of shooting, because he was basically dropped from the movie at the mid-way point, along with his entire story line.  Use him or lose him, just don't do it half way through a movie!Finally, we have a cop who is a waste of space.  Take her off the screen, use that screen time to expand Dr. Conrad's time appealing to his patient, and then you'd have had a really interesting movie.Overall, it isn't a bad movie.  It just isn't as good as it could have been either.  Save it for cheap movie night, don't get your hopes up for anything original, and enjoy the performances (especially Brittany Murphy).  Dr.'s orders.

When talking about "Don't say a word", the main thing I recall is that this thriller wasn't that thrilling.  I can honestly say that the advertising for this movie was more entertaining than the actual film.  The roles were well acted, but the plot moved along at a snails pace.  When the plot finally did move along, there was no excitement in finally finding out what was going on.** out of **** ....oh. ...and the cop was highly annoying.

This is a poorly written and utterly predictable "suspense." Though Brittany Murphy is a standout, the story is over-the-top - and when you can see everything coming, it's as suspenseful as watching paint dry.Spoiler: Michael Douglas has to save his kidnapped daughter. Oh no, will he do it?! Of course - when was the last time a commercial, bloated and sterile Hollywood film killed off a kidnapped child?It's a remarkably pathetic story on every level: Famke Jannsen has a badly broken leg, yet she ends up killing the hardened criminal out to get her, the kidnappers have been jailed for ten years and within a couple weeks have the skills to operate sophisticated audio and video surveillance material and even hide these items in secure places, and the detective who uncovers the plot has no partner and literally works alone. Outrageous and unrealistic.

I didn't watch this movie when it first came out over 20 years ago because of the negative reviews. However, I decided to watch it last night, and I was surprised how good it is.The cast is excellent: Brittany Murphy gives a stellar performance as a girl who witnessed her father's murder ten years before. Sean Bean is one of the best British actors, and plays a hero or a villain equally well. Michael Douglas and Famke Janssen also perform very well as always.There is plenty of suspense throughout, and the movie is neither too slow paced, nor too fast paced. There is sufficient character development to make the characters interesting.There is nothing wrong with the acting, screenwriting nor direction. The harsh reviews make no sense.

this movie was pretty lame overall. big buildup in the preview to not much of a movie that i haven't already seen with Michael Douglas. basically its just bits of the game, fatal attraction, traffic, basic instinct, romancing the stone, jewel of the nile, falling down, disclosure, all without the sex and nudity. *spoiler*It got me intrigued at first with Jennifer esposito, who wasn't even necessary it turns out, except saving michael douglas's life and basically brittney's too.  it just fell flat,too bad, cause i wanted to like it.

.... Is what DON'T SAY A WORD screamed at me in the opening heist sequence . This is very true to life , thieves stab each other in the back and once they're caught it's a race to turn stool pigeon and make a deal with the DA. However after the opening robbery we're treated to the domestic life of hero shrink Nathan Conrad . Cheer as Nathan tucks his daughter into bed , weep with awe as Nathan gives his wife a blanket bath , gasp in amazement as Nathan shows the audience his culinary skills in the kitchen , but don't worry the story does improve when Mr Bean and the bad boys reappear in the story ***** MILD SPOILERS *****As said the story does pick up here but your attention is drawn to some gaping plot holes . The bad guys have set up CCTV cameras in Nathan's home and have also bugged a patient's room at the local psychiatric hospital . Actually this is later explained so they're not necessarily plot holes but your attention is drawn to these details at the time so they certainly play out as holes in the plot . You also have to suspend your belief that the Bean boys can break into Nathan's flat and kidnap his daughter without Mr&Mrs Conrad noticing anything or hearing anything , but there is a massive gap in logic at the climax of the movie . The bad guys need a number from Elisabeth a patient of Nathan's and it transpires that Elisabeth is the daughter of the robber who ripped off the gang at the start of the movie and the number they're after is the number of a grave where both her father and a jewel is hidden . We're shown via flash back the gang catching up with the father killing him and then being arrested , and it's after this that Elisabeth puts the jewel hidden inside her dolly into her father's grave . Now if Elisabeth did this AFTER the gang had been arrested how would the bad guys know the number is related to a grave when they've all been in custody before , during and after the burial ? Doesn't make sense does it ?DON'T SAY A WORD is a disappointment mainly down to the run of the mill script which is a shame because a film with Michael Douglas playing a good guy and Sean Bean a bad guy should be a sure fire hit . Douglas and Bean and the rest of the cast do try to rise above the material but there's not much material to rise above in the first place
