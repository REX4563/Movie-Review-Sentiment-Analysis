Home Alone (1990) Rating: 8/10It might be dumb and corny, but I've actually liked this highly entertaining flick. The plot's unbelievable, but who cares: it's funny! Macaulay Culkin plays 8 year-old Kevin, a misunderstood kid who lives in a big ass house with his family. They're about to leave for Paris, where they're gonna spend Christmas. About 20 people are running around the house, frenetically preparing for the trip. Kevin's mad at everyone, because no one pays attention to him, unless it's to yell at him. Hence, Kevin goes to sleep wishing that his whole family would disappear, and the next morning, they do! The thing is that they somehow woke up late, left home in a hurry, and hey, they forget Lil Kev! At first, he's happy as a monkey, but after a while, things get messy. Two dumbass robbers are planning to rob his house, but Kev ain't gonna let them!Okay, I know, this is one stupid story, but it's developed into a wonderful family film, as enjoyable as it is warmhearted. Mac Culkin is awesome in the lead. He really carries the film: he's got style, he's funny and he's even a good actor! Too bad his personal life screwed up, because he had the talent to become a grown-up movie star. The idiotic criminals are also really cool, because they cast good actors instead of some Ernest-style lame-o over-actors. Oscar-winner Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern (the narrator on The Wonder Years) are hilarious, but they also bring a bit more depth to what could have been cardboard characters. Pesci plays an aggressive thug, and anyone who's seen him in a Scorsese film knows how good he is at it. Stern plays a total dufus, and he's also really convincing at it. The film's humor might seem dumb, but hey, it's funny. John Hughes' screenplay has Kevin protecting his home by turning the thieves into human Wile E. Coyotes, and like the cartoon, it made me laugh. The gags might be old, but they're played with inventiveness, and the acting is always right. I just love this film, and you will too if you look beyond the fact that it's a family film.

An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief.The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the "Wet Bandits". Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv.All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once.8/10

Christmas favourite, every year! Good acting, storyline, funny and heart warming

'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition, spawning off three sequels (including a made-for-television flop), and a whole franchise in and of it.Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.John Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).As for the acting.Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.Pesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.All in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.4.5/5 stars -

I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 400 (C H R I S T M A S ) MOVIES AND SPECIALS.BEWARE OF SOME REVIEWERS THAT ONLY HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. WHEN ITS A POSITIVE THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE NO AGENDA! I AM HONEST! I REVIEW MOVIES & SPECIALS AS A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN! I HAVE DISCOVERED MANY GEMS IN MY QUEST TO SEE AS MANY Christmas MOVIES AS I CAN. Maybe the most successful "Christmas Movie" of all time and it's easy to understand why. The film made Macaulay Culkin a household name and the biggest child star since Shirley Temple. In this film a child get left behind on accident in his Chicago home while his family has flown off for Christmas.This film takes place in Chicago, the McCallister family is preparing for a Christmas vacation in Paris. On the night before their departure, the entire family gathers at Peter and Kate's home, where their son, Kevin, is ridiculed by his siblings and cousins. After a scuffle with his older brother, Buzz, Kevin is sent to the third floor of the house, where he wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds cause damage to power lines, which causes the alarm clocks to reset; consequently, the family oversleeps. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport in time to catch their flight, Kevin is accidentally left behind.Later, Kevin wakes up to find the house empty and, thinking his wish has come true, is overjoyed with his new-found freedom. However, Kevin's joy turns to fear as he encounters his next door neighbor, "Old Man" Marley, who is rumored to have murdered his family with a snow shovel in 1958; he also encounters the "Wet Bandits", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the McCallisters' house. Kevin initially manages to keep them away by making the house look as if the family is home, but they eventually realize the deception.This film is one of the best Christmas movies however at first it is a little slow on the set-up.

My favorite movie is 'Home alone'. I think that this movie is interesting. Because Kevin is intelligent about science. If I defend my house, I can not defend my house as him. My most interest scene is Kevin fight thief, I think. This scene is laughed scene. I really like this scene. And I also like Kevin's intelligent. Because I don't have his intelligent idea. By the way, There is a sequel in this movie. I think that interesting movie is a sequel. I also like these movies sequel. But I have not remind this movie scene. I remind only scene is happy end. This movie is representing family is important, I think. Also, Kevin is lonesome.

Everybody tries hard, but "Home Alone" doesn't work nearly as well as its popularity suggests. Macaulay Culkin became a household name starring as Kevin McCallister, a precocious eight-year-old accidentally left behind when his family heads out on a holiday vacation. If fending for himself weren't enough, Kevin must also contend with two bumbling burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), who have targeted the family home.I first saw "Home Alone" when I was 10 years old. I didn't find it at all funny then, and its genius still eludes me. The alleged "humor" that everyone seems to love stems mainly from a series of violent booby traps Kevin sets up to stop the bad guys. Among the deterrents the burglars so wittingly fall for is a red-hot doorknob. Looks painful, but hardly funny. The film tries to handle such physical abuse like an old Road Runner cartoon, but when the action involves real people instead of an animated coyote, something is lost.Yet "Home Alone" isn't a total disaster. The performances are great and the story is at times quite charming, particularly the subplot involving the supposedly scary old neighborhood man. Interestingly, the sequel -- "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" -- marked a notable improvement.

I'm a young adult, and not a huge fan of the kids movies these days. Some people would classify this as a kids movie, but I think it's more of a classic. I grew up seeing this on TV every winter, and it's still one of my favorites. The sequels are awful, as are most sequels...but the original Home Alone is fantastic. I STILL laugh when I watch it. It's really one of those "feel good" movies, the kind that make you want to cuddle up on the couch with family and relax and enjoy it.If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on a great Christmas movie. Heck, it's even great for a rainy day. Watch it, you'll love it! I wish it were on more often!

"Home Alone" is a hilarious film about a young boy (Macaulay Culkin) who is accidently left home during the Christmas holidays after the rest of his family goes to Europe.  At first Culkin loves the situation, but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house.  However, Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-old and he has plans for them when they attack.  Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay.  This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays, only makes it that much more special.  All the performers do well and in the end the film also does.  4 stars out of 5.

Angels with Filthy Souls...when I first saw Home Alone I thought this black and white gangster movie that inspires Kevin was a real movie!! But I recently found out it wasn't, and much effort into making the clip as authentic as possible. Vanity Fair did a great write-up of the making of Angels of Filthy Souls in the article "Inside the Making of ​ Home Alone​'s Fake Gangster Movie" by Darryn King, which was published online on 22 Dec '15.Sure, Home Alone may not fit into the traditional canon (no girl wistfully wishing for a house on 34th Street) but it's one of my favorite Christmas movies next to Die Hard of course. In a way, Home Alone and Die Hard share similar themes of survival against the vicious criminals, with the hero using his wits and ingenuity to fight back and ensure the crooks get their just desserts.

I can only watch this movie if I fast forward past the scenes with Kevins family. His parents are ignorant uncaring people as are his cousins who are the ugliest meanest kids ever. His Uncle is a lowly POS mooching ahole as is his bullying foul mouthed toad of an older brother. I hated all of them and wished the plane the were on would crash . There is one scene where the POS Uncle tells his wife to steal the silverware they are given on the plane .I mean what a scumbag.The best parts of the movie are when Kevin and the 2 bumbling crooks Marv and Harry are onscreen. There's also a scene with the older neighbor in a church that is really tender and heartfelt. Even after the family returns at the end of the movie, they still show little concern or sympathy for Kevin after leaving him alone- they are selfish mean spirited people who just walk away and leave Kevin by himself again . 7/10 - I take away 3 stars for the awful family .

I just watched "Home Alone" for the first time in years and I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. This was such a big film when it came out and was well received by most but now it just doesn't feel on that level to me. It seems just ok, nothing great. The plot can be plodding at times and there is a good deal of negativity mixed in between some nice moments such as the scene in the church. And seeing the burglars get hurt wasn't satisfying or funny to me now but just cringeworthy. Really there were few laughs the entire film. I'm not sure if this discrepancy in perception is due to my aging or the world changing, but there it is. I will give it a 6/10 and that may be somewhat generous.

The first 2 movies will always be my favourite just like for most people these movies never get old still love watching them even today

In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment, or sickening amounts of gooey love.There are two reasons why Home Alone was such a big success. The first is that it's about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there's a worldwide conspiracy of silence. This movie yells it out loud and clear. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded. It was nominated for an Academy Award, along with the Christmas carol Somewhere In My Memory, but lost to John Barry's Dances with Wolves. Damn! In a mad rush to the airport one morning, the MacCallister family forget one little thing...Kevin (Culkin). He is an eight-year-old kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful Christmas and some time to himself. It's hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other people(the exact same house from Planes, Trains And Automobiles, don't you know0. With the rest of the MacCallisters in Paris, Kevin runs wild doing whatever he wants, eating whatever he wants and watching whatever TV show he wants.But there's one major problem. The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), are on the prowl and have knocked off every other house in Kevin's street. His is next. And seeing that he's man-of-the-house now, he HAS to defend it.Using whatever tools are at his disposal (rusty nails, blow torches, Micro Machines) he sets up a labyrinth of booby traps, so that the Wets can't break in. Their idiot-proof determination proves to be their downfall, as they are tortured and torn-up upon entering Kevin's domain.Although this is not the only point of the film, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.There are some movies that work best at Christmas and this is one of them. I'm not saying that in a couple of decades it will be the new It's A Wonderful Life, but it will be remembered fondly at the very least.Don't be a Scrooge. It's Christmastime. Go rush to check out Home Alone.

An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up.

Christmas favourite, every year! Good acting, storyline, funny and heart warming

Oh, come on, IMDb users. How could this film get only a 6.5? Yes, it's a kid's movie, but I know plenty of adults(not including myself) who loved this film. It touches our hearts, and tickles our funny bones. Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.Please give this movie a chance, it's just terrific and I guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family.10/10

The overwhelming success of 'Home Alone' (it spawned two sequels), is enough to guarantee that most people will love this story of a family that departs for Paris on the Christmas holidays, mistakenly leaving an eight-year old boy to fend for himself. And fend he does, when burglars threaten to break in unless he can rig enough booby-traps to keep them out.That's the simple plot in a nutshell. Macaulay Culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks, gestures and expressions--but for my money it's Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kid's traps.
Others in the cast don't have as much to do but do well enough by their roles, particularly Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that Kevin is missing. The laughs are steady, the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boy's fantasy of what it might be like to be left home alone. Add to that the holiday flavor of Christmas and a pleasant musical score by John Williams and you have the makings of a classic. The proof is in the pudding--they must have done something right!!

"Home Alone" is one of the most popular movies from the early 90's. Its success was phenomenal and it also made Macaulay Culkin a superstar.The plot is quite original and surreal: a child who is home alone and capable of making the bandits's lives miserable? Sure, it's an impossible story, but who cares? Far from being a perfect movie, it is however okay and fun to watch, entertaining and contains slapstick humor too although I don't like some of the language used. Our story takes place in Chicago at Christmas time, which makes this a Christmas film. In fact, the movie has lots of Christmas decorations, lights, snow and many other details which create the feeling and magic so characteristic of Christmas. To accent the Christmas atmosphere even more, there are a cup of nice Christmas carols such as "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" (performed by Brenda Lee), "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch", "White Christmas", "Carol of the Bells", "Oh Holly Night" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and some brilliant instrumental musics.Kevin McCallister is the hero of the story. He's not just any kid, he's a very smart one. He also knows all about the intentions of the "wet bandits" Harry and Marv and prepares them lots of unexpected "surprises". Their lives won't be easy with Kevin defending his house. Sure, they are the villains and as such they get what they deserve, but they do suffer a lot too. We almost feel sorry for them.The "wet bandits" were nicknamed like that by Marv because their "calling card" (according to him) was to let the water running in every houses they robbed. That said, both "wet bandits" are hilarious. Harry is more cranky, while Marv is the most stupid of the two (although both are stupid) and maybe that's why people tend to sympathize more with him. Marv's stupidity also makes him the funniest of the two. Marv is the typical tall and clumsy guy with no brain, a bit like Averell Dalton from the Lucky Luke comics.The movie has lots of funny moments. The funniest for me is when Harry and Marv pretend to be Santa Claus and his elf and the way Harry speaks in that scene, followed by the even funnier part when Kevin fires at Harry's pants. Whenever Kevin fools the bandits in a try to make them believe the whole family is at home when Kevin is all alone is funny too. For some reason, I also find funny whenever Kevin screams maniacally (particularly when he says he's not afraid anymore and sees Old Marley and screams out loud.The scenes which Kevin fools and scares the Little Nero's Pizza boy and Marv with the gangster film "Angels with Filthy Souls" are hilarious, but in the case of the Pizza boy it is unfair for him. There was no need to scare the hell out of him - he was just delivering pizza and wasn't after Kevin.Old Marley is an interesting character. I always felt sorry for him because of the lies Buzz tells about him. And the man never did anything bad to anyone. Buzz is a jerk and Uncle Frank is even worse. Buzz is mean for Kevin and Uncle Frank openly dislikes Kevin. When Uncle Frank tells Kevin «Look what you did, you little jerk!», Kevin's parents should tell him something like «Frank, stay out of this and shut up!».The church is magnificent. It's one of the biggest and most beautiful churches I've ever seen in a movie. Macaulay Culkin is terrific as the clever kid Kevin McCallister. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are awesome as the "wet bandits" and Roberts Blossom is great as the character Old Marley. It's also delightful to see John Candy as Gus Polinski, the «Polka King of the Midwest».

Seen this classic so many times and never ceases to get old. With a bunch of great scenery, adorableness, original vibes, and comedy! Macaulay Culkin shined so much, he deserved the millions earned for his role. I love how Joe Pesci went from Scorsese films where he swore so much where as in this he had to bite his tongue. John Hughe was a gifted writer that helmed some gems!

This type of family comedy truthfully works better if you are grown up with the stooges.  Because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take.  I can though.  But if you think this is strictly a kids film, parents will like it too I bet. The plot follows a kid (Macaulay Kulkin) who gets left behind in a Chicago suburb while his family leaves for Paris.  And though the house is all his, 2 burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give the best on-screen duo of 1990) want the house.  But not without the climax.  While most of the film is unbelievable (both good and bad), most of the film should keep families in good spirits, unless parents don't enjoy seeing Pesci getting his head on fire and Stern screaming like a girl.  Funny, even if it's not John Hughes' (writer/producer here) best.  B+

WHEN ITS A POSITIVE THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE NO AGENDA! I AM HONEST! I REVIEW MOVIES & SPECIALS AS A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN! I HAVE DISCOVERED MANY GEMS IN MY QUEST TO SEE AS MANY Christmas MOVIES AS I CAN. Maybe the most successful "Christmas Movie" of all time and it's easy to understand why. The film made Macaulay Culkin a household name and the biggest child star since Shirley Temple. In this film a child get left behind on accident in his Chicago home while his family has flown off for Christmas.This film takes place in Chicago, the McCallister family is preparing for a Christmas vacation in Paris. On the night before their departure, the entire family gathers at Peter and Kate's home, where their son, Kevin, is ridiculed by his siblings and cousins. After a scuffle with his older brother, Buzz, Kevin is sent to the third floor of the house, where he wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds cause damage to power lines, which causes the alarm clocks to reset; consequently, the family oversleeps. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport in time to catch their flight, Kevin is accidentally left behind.Later, Kevin wakes up to find the house empty and, thinking his wish has come true, is overjoyed with his new-found freedom. However, Kevin's joy turns to fear as he encounters his next door neighbor, "Old Man" Marley, who is rumored to have murdered his family with a snow shovel in 1958; he also encounters the "Wet Bandits", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the McCallisters' house. Kevin initially manages to keep them away by making the house look as if the family is home, but they eventually realize the deception.This film is one of the best Christmas movies however at first it is a little slow on the set-up.

Home Alone is one of the best slapstick comedies I have ever seen.The comedy is top-notch, the slapstick is fantastic.It's not just that, the direction, editing, and pacing are immaculate.And obviously Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern are phenomenal here, I can't imagine them being played by anyone else, they are just perfect.Some of these edits wouldn't be in films like this today.But this movie is also delightful, dare I say even a little heartwarming, it's the perfect Christmas movie to watch every year.I'm gonna give Home Alone an A+.

My favorite movie is 'Home alone'. I think that this movie is interesting. Because Kevin is intelligent about science. If I defend my house, I can not defend my house as him. My most interest scene is Kevin fight thief, I think. This scene is laughed scene. I really like this scene. And I also like Kevin's intelligent. Because I don't have his intelligent idea. By the way, There is a sequel in this movie. I think that interesting movie is a sequel. I also like these movies sequel. But I have not remind this movie scene. I remind only scene is happy end. This movie is representing family is important, I think. Also, Kevin is lonesome.

Everybody tries hard, but "Home Alone" doesn't work nearly as well as its popularity suggests. Macaulay Culkin became a household name starring as Kevin McCallister, a precocious eight-year-old accidentally left behind when his family heads out on a holiday vacation. If fending for himself weren't enough, Kevin must also contend with two bumbling burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), who have targeted the family home.I first saw "Home Alone" when I was 10 years old. I didn't find it at all funny then, and its genius still eludes me. The alleged "humor" that everyone seems to love stems mainly from a series of violent booby traps Kevin sets up to stop the bad guys. Among the deterrents the burglars so wittingly fall for is a red-hot doorknob. Looks painful, but hardly funny. The film tries to handle such physical abuse like an old Road Runner cartoon, but when the action involves real people instead of an animated coyote, something is lost.Yet "Home Alone" isn't a total disaster. The performances are great and the story is at times quite charming, particularly the subplot involving the supposedly scary old neighborhood man. Interestingly, the sequel -- "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" -- marked a notable improvement.

I'm a young adult, and not a huge fan of the kids movies these days. Some people would classify this as a kids movie, but I think it's more of a classic. I grew up seeing this on TV every winter, and it's still one of my favorites. The sequels are awful, as are most sequels...but the original Home Alone is fantastic. I STILL laugh when I watch it. It's really one of those "feel good" movies, the kind that make you want to cuddle up on the couch with family and relax and enjoy it.If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on a great Christmas movie. Heck, it's even great for a rainy day. Watch it, you'll love it! I wish it were on more often!

"Home Alone" is a hilarious film about a young boy (Macaulay Culkin) who is accidently left home during the Christmas holidays after the rest of his family goes to Europe.  At first Culkin loves the situation, but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house.  However, Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-old and he has plans for them when they attack.  Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay.  This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays, only makes it that much more special.  All the performers do well and in the end the film also does.  4 stars out of 5.

Angels with Filthy Souls...when I first saw Home Alone I thought this black and white gangster movie that inspires Kevin was a real movie!! But I recently found out it wasn't, and much effort into making the clip as authentic as possible. Vanity Fair did a great write-up of the making of Angels of Filthy Souls in the article "Inside the Making of ​ Home Alone​'s Fake Gangster Movie" by Darryn King, which was published online on 22 Dec '15.Sure, Home Alone may not fit into the traditional canon (no girl wistfully wishing for a house on 34th Street) but it's one of my favorite Christmas movies next to Die Hard of course. In a way, Home Alone and Die Hard share similar themes of survival against the vicious criminals, with the hero using his wits and ingenuity to fight back and ensure the crooks get their just desserts.

I can only watch this movie if I fast forward past the scenes with Kevins family. His parents are ignorant uncaring people as are his cousins who are the ugliest meanest kids ever. His Uncle is a lowly POS mooching ahole as is his bullying foul mouthed toad of an older brother. I hated all of them and wished the plane the were on would crash . There is one scene where the POS Uncle tells his wife to steal the silverware they are given on the plane .I mean what a scumbag.The best parts of the movie are when Kevin and the 2 bumbling crooks Marv and Harry are onscreen. There's also a scene with the older neighbor in a church that is really tender and heartfelt. Even after the family returns at the end of the movie, they still show little concern or sympathy for Kevin after leaving him alone- they are selfish mean spirited people who just walk away and leave Kevin by himself again . 7/10 - I take away 3 stars for the awful family .

This is one of my favourite films but I have read that a new version is to be filmed in early 2020. NOooooooooo! It does not need to be remade. It stands the test of time and is as funny now as it was on its release.

I just watched "Home Alone" for the first time in years and I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. This was such a big film when it came out and was well received by most but now it just doesn't feel on that level to me. It seems just ok, nothing great. The plot can be plodding at times and there is a good deal of negativity mixed in between some nice moments such as the scene in the church. And seeing the burglars get hurt wasn't satisfying or funny to me now but just cringeworthy. Really there were few laughs the entire film. I'm not sure if this discrepancy in perception is due to my aging or the world changing, but there it is. I will give it a 6/10 and that may be somewhat generous.

The first 2 movies will always be my favourite just like for most people these movies never get old still love watching them even today

Take a cheeky eight-year-old, put him in a situation he has to slapstick his way out of with the kind of antics most cartoon characters wouldn't survive, and what you have is one of the most wildly popular, commercially successful comedies of all time.  And when it's over, though most likely you'll have had a good time, you'll be tempted to ask the question:  Why? Because `Home Alone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, is mediocre at best, though it does have it's moments.  It's a matter of the filmmakers being very astute, perhaps, and wisely mixing in a potpourri of elements with universal appeal and touching upon that common nerve they calculated would give just about anyone in the audience something to which they could relate.  And they were right.  Kids, Christmas, family, vacation, independence, a scary situation; it's all in here.  But, interestingly enough, it lacks the sentimental value that would seemingly have made this a movie one could truly embrace.  As it is, it's engaging fare, but somehow manages to keep the viewer at arm's length.  Then again, maybe that's even part of the appeal; it may be that audiences at this particular time and place were more comfortable just watching without having to invest anything of themselves in order to have a good time.	This was, after all, 1990, and this film played to a generation weaned on more than a decade of Saturday Night Live, whose keen sense of biting satire and parody definitely had an influence on the mind-set of audiences everywhere.  And is that a bad thing?  No, absolutely not.  It merely points up one possible reason why a film centered around an eight-year-old with a somewhat derisive attitude could be so wholeheartedly received.  Also, it may be that the second half of the film, with it's over-the-top slapstick, is what made the final impression on the audience.  And this IS funny stuff; and it's going to get to even those who usually prefer humor that doesn't involve slapstick, because it's so well done.  Again, credit the filmmakers with having their fingers on the pulse of our culture and standards at the time.  But you also have to give credit to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who bring the `Wet Bandits,' Harry and Marv,  to life, and know how to put across this kind of comedy, which is no easy task.	The story itself is simple:  The extended McCallister family sets off for a Christmas vacation in Paris, and inadvertently, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets left behind.  Left alone.  At home.  Where, rising to the occasion beyond anything even the most prodigious teenager could manage, he discovers the thrill of being independent and thwarts a pair of bungling burglars in the balance.  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara as Kate, John Heard as Peter) go out of their minds when they get to Paris and discover what has happened.  If only they knew what an ingenious and imaginative son they had...	Culkin is certainly a cute kid, but can he act?  Well, the jury is still out on that one.  It's hard to say, since the dialogue he is given is so ridiculously above that of an eight-year-old, and the situations he encounters are so far-fetched, that there is no real frame of reference by which to consider it objectively.  His timing and rhythm are lacking, however, that much is clear.  His responses-- or, if you will, the punch lines he delivers-- are always a beat behind what they should be.  And it robs the humor of the spontaneity that would have made it funnier, even hilarious.  As it is, the only real laughs come from Kevin's assault on the Wet Bandits, and there are plenty to be had there.	Pesci and Stern become the real stars of the show as they play out their slapstick antics, which are truly deserving of the laughs they generate. Their expressions of incredulity in the face of the violence that is visited upon them is what makes this movie.  Everything else merely sets the stage for Harry and Marv's descent into the maelstrom.  And what Pesci and Stern do here should not be taken for granted, nor taken lightly artistically.  To put this kind of humor across takes some real talent on the part of consummate professionals, and Pesci and Stern certainly deliver it.  Their secret?  They play it straight, which keeps the silliness out of it.  Had they played it strictly as farce, it simply wouldn't have had the same impact; but by playing to the characters in the situation, rather than to a situation involving characters, it works.  And, once again, chalk up another one for Columbus and Hughes, who really know how to deliver this kind of material.	The only truly poignant moment in the film involves Kevin's encounter with a mysterious neighbor, `Old Man Marley,' played wonderfully by character actor/poet Roberts Blossom.  The revelation of his secret earlier in the film sets up the purest moment of the ending, and though it is brief, it's inspired and adds a much needed perspective to the story.	The supporting cast includes Devin Ratray (Buzz), Angela Goethals (Linnie), Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank), Hillary Wolf (Aunt Leslie), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Billie Bird (Irene), Bill Erwin (Ed) and John Candy, memorable in the role of Gus Polinski, the Polka Band shuttle Chief. Considering the ratio between this movie's substance and the success it still enjoys today, `Home Alone' is something of an anomaly in the history of the genre.  it lacks insight, yet delivers some real belly laughs.  It lacks a single character the audience can truly embrace, yet is accepted overwhelmingly as is.  It lacks inspiration, yet is an inspired film in the way it is crafted and delivered.  It's one you're probably going to like and enjoy, but upon reflection may wonder, `Why.'  And the answer?  Who can say. Go figure.  It's the magic of the movies.  6/10.

But don't forget about the presence of Stern and Pesci as bumbling comedic antagonists as Culkin is Kevin. As he is sent to his room after his jerk of a brother blames him for a mistake.And that Kevin is left behind after the family were trying to make it to France there. But at first he loves having the house to himself, eats pizza, and does things that he would not have to do.But when he misses his family there. After an old man played by the late Roberts Blossom there is meant to be scary but in reality he is a kind old man just misunderstood there.He has to protect the house while trying to get his family back home. Really a good start in MacCulay Culkin's career.

This is an odd one; I can't tell you how many times I've seen this film, yet every time is like the first. It just makes no lasting impression, and I'm always left feeling kind of cheated. The real problem here is that the only truly entertaining thing in the film(not the only funny, mind you) are the scenes of Kevin scaring off the burglars and the finale(which I won't write here, in case anyone reading this review hasn't seen the film yet). That's it. The rest of the film, sure, there are funny scenes, lines and such... but no real entertainment. The scenes of Kevin by himself, in the house, doing adult stuff are cute, but once you're over the age of ten, you won't really find them entertaining or funny... maybe you won't even see the charm I'm certain I must have seen in the scenes when I was younger. So what are we left with? Plenty of humor, some of which actually works and a few scenes of entertainment. About ten minutes of actual entertainment scattered over just over 100 minutes of film. That's just not enough. The plot is decent, but derivative and unoriginal. The characters are cardboard cutouts. The acting is fine, but no one is particularly impressive. John Williams' score is pretty good. What really bugs me about this film is the portrayal of violence as fun, and OK as long as it's against criminals. This is a film for children; is it really a good idea to show violence like that? To make it fun... and OK? I recommend this film only to people who are too smart to copy it... and it helps if you have a childish sense of humor. 6/10
