Poor Death. The guy can't seem to catch a break. He's got a job to do, and now for a third time he's being kept from doing it. What's worse is he's being foiled by a bunch of high school kids! That can't be good for the ego. Within that context you can't really blame the guy for trying to finish the job. Heck, if I were Death I'd totally relish taking some of these brats out. Particularly the guy who calls himself Frankie Cheeks. Sheesh, if that guy were any more annoying then his name would most likely be Chris Kattan.Anyway, this is a movie that's very easy to review. Did you like the first two entries in the "Final Destination" franchise? Do you like to watch irritating characters meet unseemly demises? If so then you'll love it. If not then save your money. I don't want to hear any complaining.Personally, I morbidly enjoyed it. The movie starts off with a cringe-inducing roller coaster disaster, one that will likely make you think twice about setting foot in an amusement park again, and it rarely slows down for a breather. The filmmakers set out to ensure that the viewer, like a child at Neverland Ranch, is never at ease, and that goal is accomplished as each scene leaves the viewer nervously anticipating who is going to die next.Yeah, yeah, Wendy and Kevin are desperately trying to save their peers from Death's cruel hand, but come on. We all know somebody's head is about to be turned into ground beef or somebody will be on the receiving end of a dismemberment soon. We wait ... wait ... wait ... and then BAM! Gory kill. I should probably feel guilty for laughing out loud at some of these fatalities, but since these are silly little characters that didn't die in real life I've decided not to let it weigh on my conscience.A new element to the franchise is that clues are being left as to how the characters will die. Using her nifty digital camera, Wendy was busy taking pictures for the yearbook on that fateful night. After the accident, she begins examining the pictures and realizes that she has taken at least one picture of each survivor. A little more studying reveals that she might be able to use the photos to help the characters escape Death. Is this a case of Death playing a sadistic game with Wendy and Kevin, or is there some sort of benevolent life force that's trying to help them save their friends? The filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to decide.This is a nice touch that keeps the viewer actively involved in the cinematic proceedings. It gives us the chance to try to interpret the clues and guess who might be Death's next victim and how they'll be violently killed. Perhaps that's not exactly an activity you want to participate in so keep it in mind before laying your money down.One thing that really gauges whether a movie connects with its target audience is the crowd's reaction, and I have to say that "Final Destination 3" got the loudest, most involved reaction I've witnessed in quite a while. While the deaths were being thrown at us fast and hard, the audience was oohing and ahhing with every single one. During one particularly brutal scene a girl behind me let out a high-pitched shriek so loud that I had to turn around and make sure Chris Tucker hadn't wandered into the theater.No one goes to see a "Final Destination" movie with the expectation of great acting and high brow art. They just want to be scared or freaked out. Love it or hate it, there's no denying that "Final Destination 3" at least forces you to have an opinion about it. It'll make you cringe, it'll make you turn your head in disgust, but at least it's original and creative enough to make you feel something other than absolute boredom like some other so-called horror movies out there COUGHwhenastrangercallsHACK.If just one person decides not to ride a roller coaster the next time they're at an amusement park then the filmmakers have done their job.

Final Destination 3 is basically the same film as Final Destination only this time its a roller coaster crash not a plane exploding that disrupts deaths plan.With some cool and very gory death scenes, an all new cast, and the same creepy, death's coming to get you feel as the first two films. This turns out to be way better than i would have expected.I highly recommend you see the first 2 films as well, even if they aren't required viewing as far as understanding the plot goes.6/10 its the worst of the three, but only because it no longer has the freshness and originality, it is still just as much fun to watch.

I'm not gonna lie to ya, i wasn't looking forward to final destination 3.Just seeing a roller coaster full of screaming people on the poster made me roll my eyes and assume that this franchise has run out of steam .So you can imagine my surprise to find that final destination 3 is a entertaining , funny and shocking thriller that proves that horror sequels can be pretty darn good if handled properly .Directed by james wong with style and a pace that hits the ground running ,the film is very much like a roller coaster in its self - fast,packed full of laughs and most importantly full of frights .The film is essentially a remake of the first film only with a different cast, gorier deaths and a higher level of self awareness.But this is a rare case in which copying the original isn't a bad thing- it keeps that sense of inventiveness and wit that made the first one great. It may be a clone , but its a very good one !Final destination 3 is gory ,homourous and clever fun that will make me think twice about my horror sequel prejudice....

While it was not a great or perfect film (particularly in the dialogue, ending and some of the acting), the first 'Final Destination' was entertaining and effective (especially with its terrific opening plane sequence and the creative deaths) with a fascinating idea done well.The bigger and bolder 'Final Destination 2' had its flaws but was just as good and perhaps the best of the four sequels. 'Final Destination 3' is just as big and bold, as well as gorier, and is also as good. Second sequels or third instalments of a franchise don't always fare well, especially in horror and comedy, 'Final Destination 3' is one of the better examples in a genre where sequels have a patchy history. The novelty has not yet worn off and in a way is more refined.Sure, the story is more of the same and formulaic. Meanwhile, there is too much dull downtime between deaths where dialogue and exposition can be clumsy at times.The special effects are not always brilliant and the characters are as shallow as ever.However, 'Final Destination 3' is as atmospheric and stylish as its previous two films. The music has a haunting eeriness and James Wong does a more than competent job in the director's chair, showing a genuine understanding of the concept and the horror genre, breathing atmosphere, fun and freshness into a tried and tested formula and not losing what made his direction work in the first film.Like the second, although there is a little too much of an over-reliance on gore, not all of it necessary, the death scenes are bolder, more elaborate and more creative (faring even better in this regard actually). The tanning bed and nail gun deaths were particularly good and two of the best and most imaginative of the series. The script has some wonderful humour that is black and ironic and has just as much tension and a sense of dread. The amusement park/roller-coaster scene is not as good as the opening scenes in the previous films, especially visually, but it's still very scary. The photo record is surprising and there is an intricacy in places.'Final Destination 3' has the best ending perhaps of the series, to me it's the least contrived and more logical than the one in particularly the second film. In the acting stakes, it fares favourably too. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good.Overall, a good deadly ride that's worth getting on board for, as long as one knows what to expect. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance is incredible, most of the black comedy is effective and the death scenes are creative and memorablegive. Giving you the feeling of death being everywhere despite also having a more cartoonish vibe. People scared of rollercoasters sure as hell aren't changing their minds anytime soon if they see this movie. Not to mention the occasional moments of intelligence in the script regarding death's design. Part 3 is far from the perfect slasher sequel and not as good as part 2 but it's still entertaining enough to make it a cut above the rest when it comes to slasher movies.

First off how can 35% say this is a "10" there is no original concept here at all and surely the acting is not worthy to push it that high. What we have here is the third installment of a decent concept thriller movie that literally falls flat on its face- and meets its death.The actors (outside of the female lead) are dry, stale and frankly, much too old to play teenagers. The deaths themselves are downright miracles which would fail to happen even in anyones worst nightmare. What kept FD1 and FD2 on target with the audience is that most of the deaths, "tragedies" if you will possibly could happen, from plane crashes to highway accidents, etc.. Well FD3 has NONE of that. Firstly, a roller-coaster is not going to lose every wheel and fly off in segments before some kind of security system is in effect. We can clearly see on the roller-coaster control board that there are a plethora of buttons and controls- surely one of which shuts the ride down, stops the power, etc. Anyway, after this we have two stupid 20 somethings playing cheerleader type prissies that get "locked" in their tanning beds and fry by one single wooden board. They do everything under the sun but DO NOT try to remove this board which is stuck between the two beds and could clearly be seen from the inside of the tanning beds by BOTH girls. Keep going, there are more including absurdity in a wharehouse where a NAIL GUN penetrates the skull (BUllspit) to weights coming off a bench press and squashing a guys head. This movie was thrown together without little regard for what made FD1 and FD2 fathomable: A chilling visage of reality gone wrong.. Well this movie has no threads of reality, and thanks to FD3, no threads of continuing the FD line.3/10 primarily for lead female acting (worth a point) and background scenery

Once you've seen Final Destination there's not much more of the story to tell, or twist, or reveal. All three films could actually be compiled together to make one long film, in other words, the story is told and the scene is set in part one, the two that follow just get more creative with how messy, bloody, and bazaar each person is slaughtered. And thats why I love these films.Final Destination 3 is really no different than the two before it, except the creepy bald morgue guy who seemed to have a fetish for death does not make an appearance in this one. There's not much to say, if I told you how each person were sliced, diced, smashed, crushed, impaled...you get the point, then I would be revealing the only reason any of us purchased a ticket. There is no denying those who seen this one in theaters were there just to see how bad death could be dealt. Let me tell ya, "There's some really sick and twisted ways these people die." Anyway, for those who enjoy gross and disturbing this one is worth checking out. Enjoy!

Just got back from the world premiere of Final Destination 3 at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and I must say that this film was surprisingly good. Definitely one of the gorier films that I have seen in quite some time, but very well put together and quite suspenseful. In fact, about half way through the film (during one particularly gory scene) about five audience members had to excuse themselves from the theatre. I have not seen either of the first two movies but was still able to enjoy this film so I'm sure I missed out on soem references that would have likely enhanced the experience. Still, I was quite pleased (especially because I expected the movie to be stupid) that Final Destination 3 was enjoyable for those who were not familiar with the original story. I also had the opportunity to speak with director James Wong to congratulate him a job well-done. He seems like a very nice guy.

Entertaining follow-up and again with horrifying killings . Eerie chiller with portentous special effects and results to be a nasty piece of work . This sequel of successful original by James Wong deals with a beautiful student of a High School senior named Wendy Christensen ( Maria Elizabeth Winstead ) who along with her friends go to a theme park and decide to go on a large roller coaster . There Wendy has a vision and aware which by avoiding it, she and others ( Ryan Merryman , Texas Battle, Chelan Simmons , Amanda Crew ..) around her have saved but soon begin dying in bizarre accidents . The girl's premonition of a deadly roller-coaster ride saves her life and a lucky few, but not from death itself which seeks out those who escaped their fate . Amusement and entertainment resides from attempting to guess which of the ludicrously over-determined potential hazards will deliver the creepy killings .In this third installment of the ¨Final Destination¨ series appears none character repeating from former entries , it displays suspense, tension, thrills, and creepy deaths . The chief excitement lies in seeing what new and astonishing victim can be dreamt by the believable FX technicians . Movie exist for only aim of murdering its protagonists and all around in terrifying realistic detail . Death seem to dispatch new weird killing every few minutes of movie, throughout crashing, beheading , blowing up , crushing, burning , etc . Here death is a mere computer generator FX , the ultimate gross-out show . It's frightening and entertaining though predictable but we have seen the original with similar and interesting premise . Although its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting of protagonists and all around . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Robert McLachlan . Thrilling musical score fitting to action and suspense by Shirley Walker . The motion picture is written by Glen Morgan and professionally directed by James Wong , though without originally because of going on the similar argument to former outings , being a fresh fodder . Wong has a long career as writer , producer : X-files and finally filmmaker , directing Box office success such as ¨The one¨, ¨Final destination¨ and the flop ¨Dragon ball¨. Followed by more sequels.

No, sir, I did not like it.+++Ok, there are plenty of SPOILERS below for all 3 Final Destination films, it could not be avoided. There is also some angry ranting. Be warned.+++ Final Destination has a great premise. Hard to go wrong with it, in fact. Many of the major horror franchises thrive on original and over the top deaths and with FD the possibilities are infinite.Final Destination 2 was a great sequel. It took much of the best features of the first film and cranked it up a notch or two.Final Destination 3 is an example of a wonderful premise and a good franchise being squandered. The deaths, which this series lives by, were uninspiring in comparison to the previous instalments. The 'Big Sequence' of the Roller Coaster ride was fairly uneventful, in truth. Most of the deaths in that sequence were off camera (People falling out) or, due to the coaster's speed, a case of blink-and-you-miss-it. Compare that to the stellar Car Crash sequence in the second film and you realise that a Roller Coaster From Hell might sound great on paper, but it is an extremely linear ride, in all senses.Then there are the slow build deaths. The first film had the long, drawn out death of the teacher. The second had the Kitchen -> Fire Escape sequence. Both of which kept you guessing right until the end. Extremely engaging film making. All the deaths in this came across as either 'BAM!' out of nowhere or blatantly obvious. The Tanning Sequence was indeed long and drawn out, but you could see where it was going right from the off. (And don't get me started on that 'Warning: Must'nt go over 250' Sticker. Suspension of disbelief collapsed in an instant.) The only attempts to throw you off the scent were in the Gym Sequence, however with no-knowledge of the design of that Gym Machine, I couldn't possibly have seen it coming (nor do I understand why those weights swung down like they did: Why were the wires keeping them out? What purpose would it serve letting them swing down at all? Why not bolt them?).Is it just me or did they break their own rule when killing McKinley too? The way it seems to work is that you can only save yourself or others through premonition. The trio ducked the fireworks (Which Death had set in motion) easily and they ended up killing McKinley. So what? By ducking they skipped Wendy? No, since McKinley was supposed to kill her. They killed McKinley and so that saved Wendy? No, if anyone killed McKinley it was Death and his Fireworks. Gah! The idea of McKinley being Death's chosen method was an excellent one, but the execution (in more ways than one) was disappointing.+++END SPOILERS+++ If you haven't seen it, this is not the comment for you. I cannot express my rage at this film without revealing details of it. Please save your money, go see something else. Go pick up FD1 & 2. Please.

Ghoulish sickening very good sequel, might not be appreciated as much the original but I love it! The way everything plays out is great, the music, sound effects, characters, and the deaths are awesome to me! I absolutely love the madness in Final Destination 3 it's quite different. James Wong's versions are the best despite any flaws they have. Mystery and suspense are such a great aspect.

To be honest, I hadn't expected too much from "Final Destination 3" as the 2nd installment disappointed me. While the 1st part was refreshing and suspenseful, the following one was repetitive and went over the top. What about "Final Destination 3"? It's a some kind of combination of two previous installments. In the film seriousness coexists with comedy, while the latter is more frequent than the first. Comedy, most of all, stems from characters with very low IQ. One of them shouts with superiority something like "death will never defeat me" and then dies in most ridiculous way. Thus, the film is intentionally laughable at times. What's more, the flick abounds with awesome deaths and these quality gore scenes are probably the biggest virtues of this horror movie. Besides, the script is rather superficial and repetitive. I only liked an idea of photos depicting how victims will die. That's it. Other feature ideas were taken from previous parts. To sum up, this flick is worth watching especially with your mates.

I remember when the first Final destination came out, it was original and pretty damn cool. Then the second one came out, it was wicked, ten times better and better deaths and even a conclusive ending... then came word of a 3rd final destination, i couldn't wait to see it, but when i did, I wish I had't...it was a waste of time. now, I don't expect too much from this kind of movie, however, I'd like to see more than a cut down almost gore less remake of the first movie. whoever said this movie had cool deaths and good gore to me was lying. I've seen way better, The movie is pretty much a tired excuse for lame gore. there was absolutely nothing else to this, main character rushes to save the next victim and watches them die somehow. Now I might have been able to accept those flaws if the ending wasn't so utterly pointless and stupid. pretty much the ending tells you "you just wasted your money, because if you can't escape death, you won't", thus meaning you already knows what happens to every character that was suppose to die.... that's right they die. this movie is just about the details of their deaths and they're not the greatest details either... This movie did not need to be made, rent the first two instead, then watch the first one again but fast forward all the character development scenes and the cop scenes and the scenes in the cemetery..in fact just watch the premonition scene then watch the deaths.... that's equivalent of final destination 3, oh and add your own crappy ending.

I remember seeing this film for the first time in TV without prior knowledge that it was the third in the franchise. The premise was so interesting and unique. I have not watched anything like it that time. The acting performances was good enough with no irritating main actor playing the protagonist. The visual effects and production design, though mediocre but colorful, was one of the best things about the film: it offered a kind of contrasting environment of color and danger. It went well with the cinematography. In terms of the action sequences, it was effective enough and the gory details were "gory" enough.

I was pleasantly surprised by the 3rd installment of the FINAL DESTINATION series! The worst part of the movie is the beginning and the whole roller-coaster accident, the CGI was so obvious and not real good. The first death scene was lacking any imagination and not particularly gory so it was a let down, but after that it took it up a couple notches and really won me over!! Let's face the facts we go see these types of movies for the gore factor! These types of movies aren't scary so the gore better be good and this one was! If you go in expecting great gore below average acting and a so-so story line then you won't be disappointed! I loved it for what it is supposed to be! I would recommend seeing it, buying it and showing it to your friends if you are all fans of this genre!!!

The foul loudmouthed black character was the most annoying of all the characters so naturally I squealed with delight like a little girl when he finally got his. Too bad he wasn't the first to go. I usually don't watch predictably mindless teen horror flicks, but The Final Destination series was better than most and this one was particularly worth watching, especially when the black guy got his. (Did I mention how annoying he was?) Tony Todd, as usual, slinks in and out of the movie as some vague, all-knowing, all-seeing character who understand how death operates. Hopefully there will be a future sequel where a group of Trump's cult gets wiped out at a rally. One can hope.

Having seen the first Final Destination I knew what to expect. Unfortunately this did not disappoint as yet again all the characters supposedly die although like the first one we never really see their deaths at the end. I went into this movie thinking that it would be frightening instead found it extremely boring and too predictable. Moreover the gore in this movie was just a little too extreme and almost completely impossible. One person's head is completely smashed by a weight set (you have to be in an odd position with the weights completely loaded down for that to even be possible) If you want to see Final Destination 3 I recommend saving some money and finding the first or second one on television.

Wendy is just about to step onto a rollercoaster with her friends, but just before the ride starts, she has a premonition, in which she sees the ride coming off its rails, causing many deaths. Once again, death refuses to be cheated.Final Destination 3 is still very entertaining, it's gory, it's funny, it provides plenty of unexpected moments. It's very much the same plot as the last two, but it's more outlandish, there is nothing subtle here, it's way over the top.It's funny, it's one of the only franchises I can think of, where there isn't a clear favourite, many love the first, but there are lots of fans for the others, I've asked several friends, they all favour this one.At this time I had a definite sunbed addiction, this film truly snapped me out of it, that scene is horrendous.Frankie provides a few laughs, the type of character that would pop up in the early 2000's, now likely to be massively toned down, he's such an idiot.Death casts a long shadow.7/10.

It's hard to believe that the director/writer of the original Final Destination made this awful third sequel. The original movie was a great new take on horror films. Unfortunately, this third installment is a huge disappointment. The only thing half-way good about it is the location of the amusement park. Besides that, there's nothing inventive or scary about it. The actors all suck, except for the lead girl Wendy, who is just okay. At least she's not as unlikable as the others. Unlike FD2, which was a good surprise, this was a really bad one. All the deaths are lame and uninteresting. I had high hopes after FD2 but this makes me not look forward to the upcoming 3D venture. Let's hope that's better.

What could you expect from this series except for more of the same? There are premonitions, violent and graphic death scenes, and teenagers running around looking pretty. For my first watch of the select your fate option on the DVD I ran through selecting all the left hand options as my DVD player wouldn't let me do anything else. Still I liked the idea of having a different path through the movie each time you watch it. The kills are quite memorable, especially the chaotic opening disaster. I think that if you have enjoyed the first two then you really cannot go wrong here. Some nice toplessness near the beginning. Later on I went back and selected the right path and wanted to add that this is quite stylishly made but only makes very minor differences! Pick the theatrical version, choosing their fate is not as much fun as it should be. It is fun because it has a nice story and lots of imaginative gory deaths.

I've already seen the first two Final Destination films, so naturally I had no interest in seeing this one...but what can you do when you're with a bunch of friends that all want to watch it? I guess it's a bit pointless to point out all the ineptitudes of this film, but since I've wasted ninety minutes of my life on it; I feel that I've earned the right. The 'Special Edition' DVD contains a feature that allows the viewer to change the order that the characters die in; and director James Wong obviously had this in mind when making the film, as the ridiculously over the top death scenes are just that; scenes in which someone is clearly and obviously going to die. The film is basically a very thin and highly unoriginal plot thread, which is peppered with such scenes, and the characters that manage to survive so they make it to the next scene don't have any effect on this whatsoever....thus making it all a little pointless, as the film is basically just a collection of sequences that see people die in gory and stupid ways. This may be OK for some people, but for anyone who takes their horror seriously; Final Destination 3 is a travesty.The plot is exactly the same as the other two films, in that we start with an over the top scene in which a lot of people escape death, and then see them all get their comeuppance later on. The stupidity of the plot shines through more in this film than in the two previous ones, and the idea of death coming back to claim it's intended victims is pathetic, as if 'death' really is an all powerful force...why would it go to the trouble of setting up a bizarre sequence of events to decapitate/burn/crush these people, when it could simply give them a heart attack or some other less strenuous method of death? Of course, this series is renowned for its death scenes...but by part three, it really has run its course and this film is completely needless. The gore isn't bad, however, but most of the special effects look hokey and silly, which doesn't do a film that is already hokey and silly many favours. The film rips off many better films, such as The Omen, and every time there's a stolen idea; it just reminds the audience how bad this film is. Overall, fans of the original will probably like this as well...but it's not recommended to anyone over the age of 14.

i have seen this film, and thought it was great i just love it, but it not for the faint hearted as there are some scenes which some people might find upsetting.Its a great film, so if you love action/thrillers then this is the film for you.I hope they make another, even thought some people say that making too much of one film is a bad thing but i think this was great and i would definitely see the next one, and i think many other people would agree. But there ain't many people left to play the characters (only joking ha ha)

It's appropriate that the film's opening death-event sequence is a rollercoaster, because this movie doesn't take itself all too seriously and knows exactly what tone to take at the right moments. As a fan of the Final Destination movies, this is the one that managed to absolutely nail every good element of a Final Destination movie and even improve in some areas: fun kills and gore, a bit of character drama, cut out the police subplot, and even add in a human villain (who really isn't all that much of a threat, but he's a fun enough Christian Slater from Heathers knockoff to just barely work). Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also giving a Class A performance as the protagonist character and might have more star power than any of the other series protagonists combined, hence why she went on to have the profile she did. If you're looking for a cheap mid-2000's Halloween thrill ride to watch with your friends while drunk, you can't really do much better than this.

For horror film enthusiasts, Final Destination and Final Destination II were a pleasant surprise. The original film presented a youthful but talented cast. It also offered a remarkably original premise injected with a bit of dark humor. Quite a treat! Moreover, while Final Destination II had a thinner plot, the technical effects were completely unexpected -- utterly groundbreaking. The mature casting granted the film an interesting sense of plausibility. So phenomenal a visual-spectacle is the second installment of this film that I shared it with my film class! Onto Final Destination 3. Not only are the actors ridiculously inexperienced (this is the first foray into acting for some), they seem to be utterly unaware of their less-than-mediocre talents. This is not a problem of editing, this a serious problem with casting. These actors literally have their foundation in television-acting (check the bios) ... and we are talking bad, bad cable acting (or the WB). The talent is so heinous that you hope for these actors deaths. The problem: the deaths lack creativity. The first two installments of this franchise used viewer-misdirection to shock its audience with appalling death-scenes. In this instance, the deaths are both predictable and obvious. A tremendous disappointment, indeed.And, for those Final Destination fans who think they are going to see a slightly dumbed-down echo of the first two films. ... think REALLY dumbed-down. The grotesque caricatures of teens, the ridiculously vulgar humor, the gratuitous nudity, and the excruciating writing was shocking. It is unusual to see a director deliberately ignore a film's cult-following. Not only did the director ignore the intended audience for the film, but Wong insulted that audience.For all horror enthusiasts: be prepared to leave the film angry (the SLOPPY, SLOPPY conclusion only contributes to the desire for a refund.) Trust me. This is not Final Destination 3 . . . This is Friday the Thirteenth Part 40 . . . it is base, it is amateurish, and it is an utter disgrace.

Gotta say i wasn't expecting much but i actually was very interested of what was gonna happen next... best of the all final destinations movies in my opinion.

Poor Death. The guy can't seem to catch a break. He's got a job to do, and now for a third time he's being kept from doing it. What's worse is he's being foiled by a bunch of high school kids! That can't be good for the ego. Within that context you can't really blame the guy for trying to finish the job. Heck, if I were Death I'd totally relish taking some of these brats out. Particularly the guy who calls himself Frankie Cheeks. Sheesh, if that guy were any more annoying then his name would most likely be Chris Kattan.Anyway, this is a movie that's very easy to review. Did you like the first two entries in the "Final Destination" franchise? Do you like to watch irritating characters meet unseemly demises? If so then you'll love it. If not then save your money. I don't want to hear any complaining.Personally, I morbidly enjoyed it. The movie starts off with a cringe-inducing roller coaster disaster, one that will likely make you think twice about setting foot in an amusement park again, and it rarely slows down for a breather. The filmmakers set out to ensure that the viewer, like a child at Neverland Ranch, is never at ease, and that goal is accomplished as each scene leaves the viewer nervously anticipating who is going to die next.Yeah, yeah, Wendy and Kevin are desperately trying to save their peers from Death's cruel hand, but come on. We all know somebody's head is about to be turned into ground beef or somebody will be on the receiving end of a dismemberment soon. We wait ... wait ... wait ... and then BAM! Gory kill. I should probably feel guilty for laughing out loud at some of these fatalities, but since these are silly little characters that didn't die in real life I've decided not to let it weigh on my conscience.A new element to the franchise is that clues are being left as to how the characters will die. Using her nifty digital camera, Wendy was busy taking pictures for the yearbook on that fateful night. After the accident, she begins examining the pictures and realizes that she has taken at least one picture of each survivor. A little more studying reveals that she might be able to use the photos to help the characters escape Death. Is this a case of Death playing a sadistic game with Wendy and Kevin, or is there some sort of benevolent life force that's trying to help them save their friends? The filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to decide.This is a nice touch that keeps the viewer actively involved in the cinematic proceedings. It gives us the chance to try to interpret the clues and guess who might be Death's next victim and how they'll be violently killed. Perhaps that's not exactly an activity you want to participate in so keep it in mind before laying your money down.One thing that really gauges whether a movie connects with its target audience is the crowd's reaction, and I have to say that "Final Destination 3" got the loudest, most involved reaction I've witnessed in quite a while. While the deaths were being thrown at us fast and hard, the audience was oohing and ahhing with every single one. During one particularly brutal scene a girl behind me let out a high-pitched shriek so loud that I had to turn around and make sure Chris Tucker hadn't wandered into the theater.No one goes to see a "Final Destination" movie with the expectation of great acting and high brow art. They just want to be scared or freaked out. Love it or hate it, there's no denying that "Final Destination 3" at least forces you to have an opinion about it. It'll make you cringe, it'll make you turn your head in disgust, but at least it's original and creative enough to make you feel something other than absolute boredom like some other so-called horror movies out there COUGHwhenastrangercallsHACK.If just one person decides not to ride a roller coaster the next time they're at an amusement park then the filmmakers have done their job.

Final Destination 3 is basically the same film as Final Destination only this time its a roller coaster crash not a plane exploding that disrupts deaths plan.With some cool and very gory death scenes, an all new cast, and the same creepy, death's coming to get you feel as the first two films. This turns out to be way better than i would have expected.I highly recommend you see the first 2 films as well, even if they aren't required viewing as far as understanding the plot goes.6/10 its the worst of the three, but only because it no longer has the freshness and originality, it is still just as much fun to watch.

I'm not gonna lie to ya, i wasn't looking forward to final destination 3.Just seeing a roller coaster full of screaming people on the poster made me roll my eyes and assume that this franchise has run out of steam .So you can imagine my surprise to find that final destination 3 is a entertaining , funny and shocking thriller that proves that horror sequels can be pretty darn good if handled properly .Directed by james wong with style and a pace that hits the ground running ,the film is very much like a roller coaster in its self - fast,packed full of laughs and most importantly full of frights .The film is essentially a remake of the first film only with a different cast, gorier deaths and a higher level of self awareness.But this is a rare case in which copying the original isn't a bad thing- it keeps that sense of inventiveness and wit that made the first one great. It may be a clone , but its a very good one !Final destination 3 is gory ,homourous and clever fun that will make me think twice about my horror sequel prejudice....

While it was not a great or perfect film (particularly in the dialogue, ending and some of the acting), the first 'Final Destination' was entertaining and effective (especially with its terrific opening plane sequence and the creative deaths) with a fascinating idea done well.The bigger and bolder 'Final Destination 2' had its flaws but was just as good and perhaps the best of the four sequels. 'Final Destination 3' is just as big and bold, as well as gorier, and is also as good. Second sequels or third instalments of a franchise don't always fare well, especially in horror and comedy, 'Final Destination 3' is one of the better examples in a genre where sequels have a patchy history. The novelty has not yet worn off and in a way is more refined.Sure, the story is more of the same and formulaic. Meanwhile, there is too much dull downtime between deaths where dialogue and exposition can be clumsy at times.The special effects are not always brilliant and the characters are as shallow as ever.However, 'Final Destination 3' is as atmospheric and stylish as its previous two films. The music has a haunting eeriness and James Wong does a more than competent job in the director's chair, showing a genuine understanding of the concept and the horror genre, breathing atmosphere, fun and freshness into a tried and tested formula and not losing what made his direction work in the first film.Like the second, although there is a little too much of an over-reliance on gore, not all of it necessary, the death scenes are bolder, more elaborate and more creative (faring even better in this regard actually). The tanning bed and nail gun deaths were particularly good and two of the best and most imaginative of the series. The script has some wonderful humour that is black and ironic and has just as much tension and a sense of dread. The amusement park/roller-coaster scene is not as good as the opening scenes in the previous films, especially visually, but it's still very scary. The photo record is surprising and there is an intricacy in places.'Final Destination 3' has the best ending perhaps of the series, to me it's the least contrived and more logical than the one in particularly the second film. In the acting stakes, it fares favourably too. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good.Overall, a good deadly ride that's worth getting on board for, as long as one knows what to expect. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance is incredible, most of the black comedy is effective and the death scenes are creative and memorablegive. Giving you the feeling of death being everywhere despite also having a more cartoonish vibe. People scared of rollercoasters sure as hell aren't changing their minds anytime soon if they see this movie. Not to mention the occasional moments of intelligence in the script regarding death's design. Part 3 is far from the perfect slasher sequel and not as good as part 2 but it's still entertaining enough to make it a cut above the rest when it comes to slasher movies.

First off how can 35% say this is a "10" there is no original concept here at all and surely the acting is not worthy to push it that high. What we have here is the third installment of a decent concept thriller movie that literally falls flat on its face- and meets its death.The actors (outside of the female lead) are dry, stale and frankly, much too old to play teenagers. The deaths themselves are downright miracles which would fail to happen even in anyones worst nightmare. What kept FD1 and FD2 on target with the audience is that most of the deaths, "tragedies" if you will possibly could happen, from plane crashes to highway accidents, etc.. Well FD3 has NONE of that. Firstly, a roller-coaster is not going to lose every wheel and fly off in segments before some kind of security system is in effect. We can clearly see on the roller-coaster control board that there are a plethora of buttons and controls- surely one of which shuts the ride down, stops the power, etc. Anyway, after this we have two stupid 20 somethings playing cheerleader type prissies that get "locked" in their tanning beds and fry by one single wooden board. They do everything under the sun but DO NOT try to remove this board which is stuck between the two beds and could clearly be seen from the inside of the tanning beds by BOTH girls. Keep going, there are more including absurdity in a wharehouse where a NAIL GUN penetrates the skull (BUllspit) to weights coming off a bench press and squashing a guys head. This movie was thrown together without little regard for what made FD1 and FD2 fathomable: A chilling visage of reality gone wrong.. Well this movie has no threads of reality, and thanks to FD3, no threads of continuing the FD line.3/10 primarily for lead female acting (worth a point) and background scenery

Once you've seen Final Destination there's not much more of the story to tell, or twist, or reveal. All three films could actually be compiled together to make one long film, in other words, the story is told and the scene is set in part one, the two that follow just get more creative with how messy, bloody, and bazaar each person is slaughtered. And thats why I love these films.Final Destination 3 is really no different than the two before it, except the creepy bald morgue guy who seemed to have a fetish for death does not make an appearance in this one. There's not much to say, if I told you how each person were sliced, diced, smashed, crushed, impaled...you get the point, then I would be revealing the only reason any of us purchased a ticket. There is no denying those who seen this one in theaters were there just to see how bad death could be dealt. Let me tell ya, "There's some really sick and twisted ways these people die." Anyway, for those who enjoy gross and disturbing this one is worth checking out. Enjoy!

Just got back from the world premiere of Final Destination 3 at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and I must say that this film was surprisingly good. Definitely one of the gorier films that I have seen in quite some time, but very well put together and quite suspenseful. In fact, about half way through the film (during one particularly gory scene) about five audience members had to excuse themselves from the theatre. I have not seen either of the first two movies but was still able to enjoy this film so I'm sure I missed out on soem references that would have likely enhanced the experience. Still, I was quite pleased (especially because I expected the movie to be stupid) that Final Destination 3 was enjoyable for those who were not familiar with the original story. I also had the opportunity to speak with director James Wong to congratulate him a job well-done. He seems like a very nice guy.

Entertaining follow-up and again with horrifying killings . Eerie chiller with portentous special effects and results to be a nasty piece of work . This sequel of successful original by James Wong deals with a beautiful student of a High School senior named Wendy Christensen ( Maria Elizabeth Winstead ) who along with her friends go to a theme park and decide to go on a large roller coaster . There Wendy has a vision and aware which by avoiding it, she and others ( Ryan Merryman , Texas Battle, Chelan Simmons , Amanda Crew ..) around her have saved but soon begin dying in bizarre accidents . The girl's premonition of a deadly roller-coaster ride saves her life and a lucky few, but not from death itself which seeks out those who escaped their fate . Amusement and entertainment resides from attempting to guess which of the ludicrously over-determined potential hazards will deliver the creepy killings .In this third installment of the ¨Final Destination¨ series appears none character repeating from former entries , it displays suspense, tension, thrills, and creepy deaths . The chief excitement lies in seeing what new and astonishing victim can be dreamt by the believable FX technicians . Movie exist for only aim of murdering its protagonists and all around in terrifying realistic detail . Death seem to dispatch new weird killing every few minutes of movie, throughout crashing, beheading , blowing up , crushing, burning , etc . Here death is a mere computer generator FX , the ultimate gross-out show . It's frightening and entertaining though predictable but we have seen the original with similar and interesting premise . Although its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting of protagonists and all around . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Robert McLachlan . Thrilling musical score fitting to action and suspense by Shirley Walker . The motion picture is written by Glen Morgan and professionally directed by James Wong , though without originally because of going on the similar argument to former outings , being a fresh fodder . Wong has a long career as writer , producer : X-files and finally filmmaker , directing Box office success such as ¨The one¨, ¨Final destination¨ and the flop ¨Dragon ball¨. Followed by more sequels.

No, sir, I did not like it.+++Ok, there are plenty of SPOILERS below for all 3 Final Destination films, it could not be avoided. There is also some angry ranting. Be warned.+++ Final Destination has a great premise. Hard to go wrong with it, in fact. Many of the major horror franchises thrive on original and over the top deaths and with FD the possibilities are infinite.Final Destination 2 was a great sequel. It took much of the best features of the first film and cranked it up a notch or two.Final Destination 3 is an example of a wonderful premise and a good franchise being squandered. The deaths, which this series lives by, were uninspiring in comparison to the previous instalments. The 'Big Sequence' of the Roller Coaster ride was fairly uneventful, in truth. Most of the deaths in that sequence were off camera (People falling out) or, due to the coaster's speed, a case of blink-and-you-miss-it. Compare that to the stellar Car Crash sequence in the second film and you realise that a Roller Coaster From Hell might sound great on paper, but it is an extremely linear ride, in all senses.Then there are the slow build deaths. The first film had the long, drawn out death of the teacher. The second had the Kitchen -> Fire Escape sequence. Both of which kept you guessing right until the end. Extremely engaging film making. All the deaths in this came across as either 'BAM!' out of nowhere or blatantly obvious. The Tanning Sequence was indeed long and drawn out, but you could see where it was going right from the off. (And don't get me started on that 'Warning: Must'nt go over 250' Sticker. Suspension of disbelief collapsed in an instant.) The only attempts to throw you off the scent were in the Gym Sequence, however with no-knowledge of the design of that Gym Machine, I couldn't possibly have seen it coming (nor do I understand why those weights swung down like they did: Why were the wires keeping them out? What purpose would it serve letting them swing down at all? Why not bolt them?).Is it just me or did they break their own rule when killing McKinley too? The way it seems to work is that you can only save yourself or others through premonition. The trio ducked the fireworks (Which Death had set in motion) easily and they ended up killing McKinley. So what? By ducking they skipped Wendy? No, since McKinley was supposed to kill her. They killed McKinley and so that saved Wendy? No, if anyone killed McKinley it was Death and his Fireworks. Gah! The idea of McKinley being Death's chosen method was an excellent one, but the execution (in more ways than one) was disappointing.+++END SPOILERS+++ If you haven't seen it, this is not the comment for you. I cannot express my rage at this film without revealing details of it. Please save your money, go see something else. Go pick up FD1 & 2. Please.

Ghoulish sickening very good sequel, might not be appreciated as much the original but I love it! The way everything plays out is great, the music, sound effects, characters, and the deaths are awesome to me! I absolutely love the madness in Final Destination 3 it's quite different. James Wong's versions are the best despite any flaws they have. Mystery and suspense are such a great aspect.

To be honest, I hadn't expected too much from "Final Destination 3" as the 2nd installment disappointed me. While the 1st part was refreshing and suspenseful, the following one was repetitive and went over the top. What about "Final Destination 3"? It's a some kind of combination of two previous installments. In the film seriousness coexists with comedy, while the latter is more frequent than the first. Comedy, most of all, stems from characters with very low IQ. One of them shouts with superiority something like "death will never defeat me" and then dies in most ridiculous way. Thus, the film is intentionally laughable at times. What's more, the flick abounds with awesome deaths and these quality gore scenes are probably the biggest virtues of this horror movie. Besides, the script is rather superficial and repetitive. I only liked an idea of photos depicting how victims will die. That's it. Other feature ideas were taken from previous parts. To sum up, this flick is worth watching especially with your mates.

I remember when the first Final destination came out, it was original and pretty damn cool. Then the second one came out, it was wicked, ten times better and better deaths and even a conclusive ending... then came word of a 3rd final destination, i couldn't wait to see it, but when i did, I wish I had't...it was a waste of time. now, I don't expect too much from this kind of movie, however, I'd like to see more than a cut down almost gore less remake of the first movie. whoever said this movie had cool deaths and good gore to me was lying. I've seen way better, The movie is pretty much a tired excuse for lame gore. there was absolutely nothing else to this, main character rushes to save the next victim and watches them die somehow. Now I might have been able to accept those flaws if the ending wasn't so utterly pointless and stupid. pretty much the ending tells you "you just wasted your money, because if you can't escape death, you won't", thus meaning you already knows what happens to every character that was suppose to die.... that's right they die. this movie is just about the details of their deaths and they're not the greatest details either... This movie did not need to be made, rent the first two instead, then watch the first one again but fast forward all the character development scenes and the cop scenes and the scenes in the cemetery..in fact just watch the premonition scene then watch the deaths.... that's equivalent of final destination 3, oh and add your own crappy ending.

I remember seeing this film for the first time in TV without prior knowledge that it was the third in the franchise. The premise was so interesting and unique. I have not watched anything like it that time. The acting performances was good enough with no irritating main actor playing the protagonist. The visual effects and production design, though mediocre but colorful, was one of the best things about the film: it offered a kind of contrasting environment of color and danger. It went well with the cinematography. In terms of the action sequences, it was effective enough and the gory details were "gory" enough.

I was pleasantly surprised by the 3rd installment of the FINAL DESTINATION series! The worst part of the movie is the beginning and the whole roller-coaster accident, the CGI was so obvious and not real good. The first death scene was lacking any imagination and not particularly gory so it was a let down, but after that it took it up a couple notches and really won me over!! Let's face the facts we go see these types of movies for the gore factor! These types of movies aren't scary so the gore better be good and this one was! If you go in expecting great gore below average acting and a so-so story line then you won't be disappointed! I loved it for what it is supposed to be! I would recommend seeing it, buying it and showing it to your friends if you are all fans of this genre!!!

The foul loudmouthed black character was the most annoying of all the characters so naturally I squealed with delight like a little girl when he finally got his. Too bad he wasn't the first to go. I usually don't watch predictably mindless teen horror flicks, but The Final Destination series was better than most and this one was particularly worth watching, especially when the black guy got his. (Did I mention how annoying he was?) Tony Todd, as usual, slinks in and out of the movie as some vague, all-knowing, all-seeing character who understand how death operates. Hopefully there will be a future sequel where a group of Trump's cult gets wiped out at a rally. One can hope.

Having seen the first Final Destination I knew what to expect. Unfortunately this did not disappoint as yet again all the characters supposedly die although like the first one we never really see their deaths at the end. I went into this movie thinking that it would be frightening instead found it extremely boring and too predictable. Moreover the gore in this movie was just a little too extreme and almost completely impossible. One person's head is completely smashed by a weight set (you have to be in an odd position with the weights completely loaded down for that to even be possible) If you want to see Final Destination 3 I recommend saving some money and finding the first or second one on television.

Wendy is just about to step onto a rollercoaster with her friends, but just before the ride starts, she has a premonition, in which she sees the ride coming off its rails, causing many deaths. Once again, death refuses to be cheated.Final Destination 3 is still very entertaining, it's gory, it's funny, it provides plenty of unexpected moments. It's very much the same plot as the last two, but it's more outlandish, there is nothing subtle here, it's way over the top.It's funny, it's one of the only franchises I can think of, where there isn't a clear favourite, many love the first, but there are lots of fans for the others, I've asked several friends, they all favour this one.At this time I had a definite sunbed addiction, this film truly snapped me out of it, that scene is horrendous.Frankie provides a few laughs, the type of character that would pop up in the early 2000's, now likely to be massively toned down, he's such an idiot.Death casts a long shadow.7/10.

I've already seen the first two Final Destination films, so naturally I had no interest in seeing this one...but what can you do when you're with a bunch of friends that all want to watch it? I guess it's a bit pointless to point out all the ineptitudes of this film, but since I've wasted ninety minutes of my life on it; I feel that I've earned the right. The 'Special Edition' DVD contains a feature that allows the viewer to change the order that the characters die in; and director James Wong obviously had this in mind when making the film, as the ridiculously over the top death scenes are just that; scenes in which someone is clearly and obviously going to die. The film is basically a very thin and highly unoriginal plot thread, which is peppered with such scenes, and the characters that manage to survive so they make it to the next scene don't have any effect on this whatsoever....thus making it all a little pointless, as the film is basically just a collection of sequences that see people die in gory and stupid ways. This may be OK for some people, but for anyone who takes their horror seriously; Final Destination 3 is a travesty.The plot is exactly the same as the other two films, in that we start with an over the top scene in which a lot of people escape death, and then see them all get their comeuppance later on. The stupidity of the plot shines through more in this film than in the two previous ones, and the idea of death coming back to claim it's intended victims is pathetic, as if 'death' really is an all powerful force...why would it go to the trouble of setting up a bizarre sequence of events to decapitate/burn/crush these people, when it could simply give them a heart attack or some other less strenuous method of death? Of course, this series is renowned for its death scenes...but by part three, it really has run its course and this film is completely needless. The gore isn't bad, however, but most of the special effects look hokey and silly, which doesn't do a film that is already hokey and silly many favours. The film rips off many better films, such as The Omen, and every time there's a stolen idea; it just reminds the audience how bad this film is. Overall, fans of the original will probably like this as well...but it's not recommended to anyone over the age of 14.

What could you expect from this series except for more of the same? There are premonitions, violent and graphic death scenes, and teenagers running around looking pretty. For my first watch of the select your fate option on the DVD I ran through selecting all the left hand options as my DVD player wouldn't let me do anything else. Still I liked the idea of having a different path through the movie each time you watch it. The kills are quite memorable, especially the chaotic opening disaster. I think that if you have enjoyed the first two then you really cannot go wrong here. Some nice toplessness near the beginning. Later on I went back and selected the right path and wanted to add that this is quite stylishly made but only makes very minor differences! Pick the theatrical version, choosing their fate is not as much fun as it should be. It is fun because it has a nice story and lots of imaginative gory deaths.

It's hard to believe that the director/writer of the original Final Destination made this awful third sequel. The original movie was a great new take on horror films. Unfortunately, this third installment is a huge disappointment. The only thing half-way good about it is the location of the amusement park. Besides that, there's nothing inventive or scary about it. The actors all suck, except for the lead girl Wendy, who is just okay. At least she's not as unlikable as the others. Unlike FD2, which was a good surprise, this was a really bad one. All the deaths are lame and uninteresting. I had high hopes after FD2 but this makes me not look forward to the upcoming 3D venture. Let's hope that's better.

i have seen this film, and thought it was great i just love it, but it not for the faint hearted as there are some scenes which some people might find upsetting.Its a great film, so if you love action/thrillers then this is the film for you.I hope they make another, even thought some people say that making too much of one film is a bad thing but i think this was great and i would definitely see the next one, and i think many other people would agree. But there ain't many people left to play the characters (only joking ha ha)

With no villain and impossible yet plausible deaths, final destination has a high octane creep factor that will keep you on edge for weeks after. The third installment is no exception. Wild deaths, decent acting, and no storyline necessary. This movie screams the 2000s, a girl with her flip phone and highlights.

For horror film enthusiasts, Final Destination and Final Destination II were a pleasant surprise. The original film presented a youthful but talented cast. It also offered a remarkably original premise injected with a bit of dark humor. Quite a treat! Moreover, while Final Destination II had a thinner plot, the technical effects were completely unexpected -- utterly groundbreaking. The mature casting granted the film an interesting sense of plausibility. So phenomenal a visual-spectacle is the second installment of this film that I shared it with my film class! Onto Final Destination 3. Not only are the actors ridiculously inexperienced (this is the first foray into acting for some), they seem to be utterly unaware of their less-than-mediocre talents. This is not a problem of editing, this a serious problem with casting. These actors literally have their foundation in television-acting (check the bios) ... and we are talking bad, bad cable acting (or the WB). The talent is so heinous that you hope for these actors deaths. The problem: the deaths lack creativity. The first two installments of this franchise used viewer-misdirection to shock its audience with appalling death-scenes. In this instance, the deaths are both predictable and obvious. A tremendous disappointment, indeed.And, for those Final Destination fans who think they are going to see a slightly dumbed-down echo of the first two films. ... think REALLY dumbed-down. The grotesque caricatures of teens, the ridiculously vulgar humor, the gratuitous nudity, and the excruciating writing was shocking. It is unusual to see a director deliberately ignore a film's cult-following. Not only did the director ignore the intended audience for the film, but Wong insulted that audience.For all horror enthusiasts: be prepared to leave the film angry (the SLOPPY, SLOPPY conclusion only contributes to the desire for a refund.) Trust me. This is not Final Destination 3 . . . This is Friday the Thirteenth Part 40 . . . it is base, it is amateurish, and it is an utter disgrace.

It's appropriate that the film's opening death-event sequence is a rollercoaster, because this movie doesn't take itself all too seriously and knows exactly what tone to take at the right moments. As a fan of the Final Destination movies, this is the one that managed to absolutely nail every good element of a Final Destination movie and even improve in some areas: fun kills and gore, a bit of character drama, cut out the police subplot, and even add in a human villain (who really isn't all that much of a threat, but he's a fun enough Christian Slater from Heathers knockoff to just barely work). Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also giving a Class A performance as the protagonist character and might have more star power than any of the other series protagonists combined, hence why she went on to have the profile she did. If you're looking for a cheap mid-2000's Halloween thrill ride to watch with your friends while drunk, you can't really do much better than this.
