I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like "Mr. Woodcock" and "Good Luck Chuck," movies with no real craft to any of their jokes."Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!" "He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!" No. Die.Knocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works.

I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, not having seen the trailer, and two hours later I felt I had seen a decent movie, quite funny at times, but I couldn't figure out what everyone was making such a big deal about. Compared to a lot of what passes for comedy in the cinema these days, Knocked Up is great, but it's hardly the "instant classic" that I've seen it called in many professional and IMDb reviews. It's certainly worth seeing, but maybe at a discount matinée instead of a full-price evening show.Much of what is wrong with Knocked Up is simply an over-reliance on Seth Rogen to deliver the laughs. To be sure, Rogen is a funny guy - he handled the jump from second-tier supporting actor (a la 40 Year Old Virgin) to leading man surprisingly well, appearing confident and charismatic. The problem is that as the film goes on, he just doesn't get a whole lot to work with from his supporting cast. Rogen doesn't have enough in him at this point to carry an entire film on his shoulders, but often he is forced into that role, providing the only humor in many scenes (especially in the second half of the movie). At times it almost seems as if Rogen has landed in the wrong film, delivering clever quips and laughs while the barely-likable characters around him remain too serious. Paul Rudd manages to break this up, taking some of the burden off Rogen, but Katherine Heigl and Leslie Mann's unfunny and quasi-sympathetic characters drag them down.To be sure, the first half of Knocked Up is great, but by the second half the script becomes mired in slow, cliché drama. Marital dissatisfaction and the loss of youth are interesting themes to explore, but in doing so, Knocked Up fails to establish a consistent tone. As the film trudges past the 90-minute mark, it is sometimes humorous, sometimes dour, often clichéd, all resulting in an awkward mix of styles.Overall, Knocked Up was a good effort, but a little more editing of the script would have helped a lot. I don't mind long movies at all, but 20 minutes could have been trimmed from this film to good effect.

I enjoyed the show to be very honest
What I never liked was the total over the top excessive vulgar language which the characters blasted out Willy nilly
Several of the scenes were totally wasted and unnecessary and gives the feeling that they were just put in to puff out the movie to the over two hours
I would have given the movie a good 8 but the totally vile language that was sprouted makes me grade it actually as a 6
However what saves the day is the relevance of the subject and having experienced some of the things shown to he's a raw nerve with me
I did not enjoy the multitude of four letter words which in my opinion was very. Excessive
Why directors think that using four letter words and certain parts of a woman's anatomy is right or justified beggars belief
Using language like that just shows that the directors and writers are ignorant and that is the maximum of their thinking capacity
While the topics are relevant and identifiable and there are positive lessons to be taken out of the movie the bad language reduces the show to a free for all crude language grade C movie.Baby on Board with Heather Graham and Jerry O Connel was also rude and crude with some bad language several scenes of nudity but the message there was ultra clear and is a show I recommend when I talk snout the dangers of assumption
That show I would recommend a hundred times over Knocked Up
There are powerful messages that one can learn from in the movies but it's the rude crude and bad language that kills this movie for me
Another. Show that also involves bad language is THATS MY BOY with Adam Sandler
One of the least enjoyable shows of his
In many of his movies he also has bad language but not as bad as this show
It's worth watching if you can get past the bad language because it does have a decent and r elegant plot dealing with relationships though.

When Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is promoted in E! Television, she goes to a night-club to celebrate with her older married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). Alison meets the pothead reckless Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) and while having a small talk with him, Debbie's husband Pete (Paul Rudd) calls her to tell that their daughter has chickenpox. Debbie immediately leaves the place but Allison stays with Ben, drinking and dancing along all night; completely wasted, they end up having a one night stand. Ben does not use condom and eight weeks later, Allison discovers that she is pregnant. She calls Ben and they decide to try to stay together and have the baby. But the immatures Ben needs to grow-up first to raise a family of his own."Knocked Up" is a funny comedy and an entertaining romance with a charming cast. Seth Rogen and the gorgeous Katherine Heigl show a perfect chemistry with their charismatic characters, very well supported by Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, and I laughed a lot with the most hilarious situations. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Ligeiramente Grávidos" ("Slightly Pregnants")

"Knocked Up" is a well-made, enjoyable comedy about the consequences of an unprotected one-night stand. It has dual lessons for its lead characters: Seth Rogen has to learn to grow up and accept responsibility and Katherine Heigl has to choose between a professional life as a television interviewer or a possibly less rewarding (as she sees it) life as a stay-at-home mom.And because it's Judd Apatow, he handles the sex gags carefully and with enough maturity that it doesn't become another stale sex comedy. But I think some people jumping on the Apatow bandwagon are so eager to praise him as the "Savior" of the sex-comedy genre that they are overlooking some of the film's flaws.First of all, if we're going to be picky, the comedy isn't very consistent. Which is OK - I'd prefer it that way - but when you see reviews touting it as "the funniest movie of the year," expectations can't help but build.I didn't think the acting was as good as in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." Seth Rogen is a great supporting actor - but I find him rather irritating as a lead character. His revelation at the end of the film, too, isn't very believable - they spend so much time focusing on his life as a slacker that the transition between him being a man-child and accepting responsibility is as realistic as a "Rocky" training montage; he has a heartfelt talk with his dad (Harold Ramis) and suddenly he's 100% willing to become committed. Okay.I'm not a big Heigl fan, but she fit the role well here. Paul Rudd was the real scene-stealer, though. But he's thrown off-balance by the casting of Apatow's wife - can he PLEASE stop putting her in all his movies? She can't act.Overall, this is an OK comedy - better than most of its genre - and the drama is more realistic than most sex comedies, but some people were so willing to jump on it as a "masterpiece" of its genre before it even came out that the hype just killed it for me.

'Knocked-Up' was far better than I had hoped. I was not impress with the '40 Year-Old Virgin' or 'Superbad' which were crass and uninspiring. 'Knocked-Up' in stark contrast still maintains the adolescence humor of '40 Year-Old Virgin' or 'Superbad' but is far more intelligent and witty, bordering at times on comedic brilliance. It is also able to match the comedy with a sincere thread throughout, which is hard to achieve. Seth Rogen is great as the expectant father, I am unsure how much of the script was improvised but there were many moments of laugh-out-loud originality, the whole cast delivers on the acting front. At times the jokes can be a little too crude, but overall they are well managed. Special mention to the scene in the Las Vegas hotel between Rogen and Paul Rudd, high on mushrooms their interplay is spot-on and it is moments like this which make it memorable.The one criticism I do have is the last 30 minutes, the gags do not seem to work as well due to the more serious tone, and the film lumbers a little. I respect that the film wanted to make an emotional punch at the end but it dallied a little too long.'Knocked-Up' is an enjoyable film and I recommend that you make an effort to watch it.

Greetings again from the darkness. "Freaks and Geeks" lives on through multiple tie-ins - not the least of which is writer/director and producer Judd Apatow (best known for his smash hit "40 Year Old Virgin"). This is a sharp comedy and cutting insight thanks to a terrific script, excellent comedic timing from Seth Rogen and Apatow's feel for a scene.Rogen plays Ben Stone, a slacker who spends all his time smoking pot with his friends and conceptualizing an "informational" web site. One evening, while hanging with his buds in a club, he stumbles onto a ridiculously beautiful and ripe for the taking Katherine Heigl (Izzie from Grey's Anatomy). One thing leads to another and the next thing we know Heigl's character, Alison, is knocked up.It would be easy to classify this as a slapstick comedy in the mode of "Wedding Crashers", but in fact, Apatow's script offers up some insightful commentary on marriage, family and relationships of all types. Apatow's real life wife, Leslie Mann, plays Heigl's sister who dreams of the perfect marriage, but is crushed when she discovers her husband's secret (not what you think). Mann's "cheating" husband is played brilliantly by Paul Rudd ... who flashes a very nice DeNiro impersonation.The only weaknesses of the film are the shortage of scenes between Heigl and Rogen, and the fact that the film probably lasts 15 minutes too long. The whole Las Vegas sequence could have been cut. Still, this is not your typical comedy and please be prepared for some harsh (and loud) language and some very graphic visuals ... it is rated R for more than one reason! Apatow is creating his own look and feel and shows flashes of brilliant comedy writing. He could challenge the Cohen Brothers in the near future for the throne of off-beat comedy. Don't miss the fine songs from Loudon Wainwright III - especially the one playing over the closing credits.

A "fairly unattractive" man. Who smokes weed. Has no life. Living off a compensation benefit. Meets a "pretty" woman. At a club. They both get drunk. Have sex. Woman becomes pregnant...You get the drift, I could actually write this review in the same context all the way through. This is probably as close as to how the film has been constructed.I can't say that I enjoyed the "40 Year Old Virgin" in fact, I thought it was boring, crap storyline, segments were funny, with random scenes and locations which had no relevance to the film to fill in extra minutes for your money, and so on, so forth. This is EXACTLY what happens in "Knocked Up".What annoys me, is the fact that this film could of been so good. I wanted it to make that extra yard to make me fall out of my seat, so, so, so much. It just reminded me of crap sex, an ongoing ordeal that you think will come to something, and just when you think things are going your way, it all flops down.I can't completely slag this film though, as Seth Rogan shows what a talented actor he can be in funny situations. I think he will be one to watch out for in the future for sure. He has some brilliant one liners it has to be said! Katherine Heigl also done a blinding performance, its such a shame, because the storyline and little plot-holes completely screwed them both over. They are big actors for the big comic bound occasion, its a shame they were blindfolded and given shocking scenario's to work with.Of course it has its moments, but nothing that makes you go to pub with your mates and chat about it. I was very whole-heartedly disappointed with this film. So much speculation ruins a good thing ya' know? Possibly the most over-rated comedy of 2007. Yes. Down to the shoddy direction of the film. Absolutely. Possibly showcasing the new coming talent of comedies for the future. Maybe. With the right ingredients.

In director Judd Apatow's follow-up to his 2005 sleeper hit "The 40-year old virgin", Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a young and sexy TV presenter find herself pregnant after a one night-stand with Ben Stone, a twenty-something overweight unemployed pothead and looser living without any revenue with his stone-slackers roommates. Despite their differences, they try to make the best of the situation.Alfred Hitchcock once describe a kind of movie which are pleasant to watch and leave you satisfied when you go out from the theater but then, at midnight, when you open your fridge for a snack and think a little bit more about it, you realize it didn't really make sense and was nowhere as good as you thought it was. "Knocked up" is this kind of movie.It is entertaining, funny and well played but, on a second thought not very good. Part of the problem comes from the fact that Alison and Ben don't belong to the same movie. Alison and her family remain believable characters even though some aspects of their life and personalities are exaggerated for comedic purpose. On the other hand, Ben's entourage looks like castaways from "Napoleon dynamite" or some other over-the-top comedy and are totally unrealistic. This is particularly problematic for the character of Ben who interacts with both groups: hence, he sometimes appears as an outrageous caricature (as when he doesn't realize that it might not be very wise on a first date with a woman way out of your league to mention that you and your pothead friends are currently working on building a porn website. But since the porn website is how Alison later finds back Ben's trail, I suppose we can simply attribute that to lazy screen writing), other times as a more mature and reality-grounded character.Another problem is that Apatow seems to run out of ideas midway through the movie. Once Alison and Ben decide to keep the baby, they start dating and things go well. But ultimately, Alison breaks up with Ben. At this point, the movie just run into free wheels, Apatow wasting his time with comedic fillers bringing nothing to the plot so that, when it's time to come back to the plot, what should have been major development in the story are rushed out: when Ben finally graduates from retarded teenager to responsible adult, it is through a montage and, when it's time for Allison to give birth, Ben and her simply goes back together as if Alison's reasons for breaking from Ben in the first place never really mattered, a simple device to keep the plot boiling.Finally, this is probably the first movie where I saw product placement for another movie playing at the same time in the theater: "Spiderman 3", also produced by Sony and released just a few week before "Knocked up" in theaters, is referenced twice, the characters expressing their urgent desire to see it, and James Franco, who stars in "Spiderman 3", makes a cameo, appearing in Alison's TV show where he discusses, you guessed it, his role in "Spiderman 3"!

After watching Knocked Up I left with a feeling that I wanted SOMETHING more. Yes, it sure had good bits of that 40 Year Old Virgin type humor, and it was also a lot sweeter and more serious than 40 YOV...but that is where I think it failed. The movie had no identity.I wasn't sure how to handle the characters. Was I supposed to identify with them and take them seriously? Or was I supposed to laugh at how goofy they were? There was a little bit of both, but because of that I was never really able to get into the groove of it. In this case two halves did NOT make a whole.Sure, it was good for a few laughs, the acting was fine (not outstanding), the production was fine (again, not outstanding)...but I don't think it was worth seeing in the theaters. It just left me in limbo...I couldn't really get into the comedy because these were SERIOUS issues they explored, and I also couldn't take the characters and their problems as seriously as I wanted to because of the wacky 40 YOV humor. Knocked Up tried to be two things at once, and because of that it lost lots of power on both sides of the coin.Maybe people like this new kind of "half comedy"...but I couldn't really get into it. And it just seemed to drag ON AND ON. Especially because from what I heard there was supposed to be constant gut busting humor...but to be honest, I don't think this is nearly as good as 40 YOV, because it takes itself too seriously. You knew what 40 YOV was from the start, right up the goofy song ending...they kept you in that comedy mode. But Knocked Up seemed to get caught in no man's land to me...and just couldn't satisfy either my want for comedy or my want for romance/drama.Overall it's not a bad film, but I'd wait for it on DVD and a lazy, rainy day :)

Granted there are a few funny moments in this film, but it really lacks the warmth (and dare I say heart) of say, 40 Year Old Virgin. Seth Rogen is too grimy to ever really be likable, the rest of the performances are average at best. As a whole the flimsy storyline is pretty darn bad, let's face it.What worries me is the film's messages. 1. That it's OK to smoke bongs all day and be a perpetual underachiever, and 2. that unplanned pregnancies end happily ever after.Sorry, but a film whose laughs come from a 6 year a old girl saying "penis" and "prick" is an insult to everyone's intelligence.

Knocked Up did its applaudably, insightfully wise job. It lured its conventional teen target consumers into a hard-to-miss universal social commentary. It is stunningly enlightening and intelligent, not in a vernacular or high-brow sense but emboldeningly sharp in its assertion of wisdom and sensibility within the mainstream American culture of regular pop culture-driven people of today.Judd Apatow is so honest and wise in his portrayal of the all-American knocked-up situation, that everything makes sense despite how stupid things are. Take for example the most obvious and necessary scene in the movie, which is when Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl get drunk and wind up at her house having sex. Rogen is battling to maintain an erection and fit a condom on while keeping the pace. Heigl gets impatient and says, "Just do it!" Of course, she's trying to speed up the fastening of the condom. But also of course, he interprets that as "Forget the condom, let's go." This clearly pivotal moment in the movie could so easily have been botched.Apatow is very much above the stick figure story. See, a lot of the time when Hollywood wants to make a commercial movie with a message pertaining to an oft-confronted conflict in or because of American culture, they simply take a classic scenario and fill in the blanks, which would just be character names, place, et cetera. Knocked Up begins with its characters. It also sets the stage for hilarity at their expense. Rogen is not just a horny American Pie party animal. He's an immature Jewish Canadian who is building a website of all the great nudie film scenes with his LA pothead friends. He lives there and doesn't pay taxes, living on an injury settlement. Heigl is a competent, together, motivated woman who is promoted anchorwoman for E! TV and lives with her sister, who is married with a family. She goes to a nightclub because she is rewarding herself with a good time and he goes to the same nightclub because he and his friends spontaneously decided to go. This pairing is an extremely socially and psychologically perceptive comic manipulation. Their occupations and immediate social personalities are specifically and deeply opposing.It's not just a farce, however. It takes itself seriously. Seth Rogen's character's personality is actually a good model for describing the climate of the film. It's hilarious with a whip-smart sense of timing and comeback, yet it isn't simply a breezy clown because there's so much aggression and passion behind it's sense of humor. This leaves room for the most comfortable and considerate poignancy in a Hollywood movie directed at young people in years. All of the couple's fears and mutually irritating idiosyncracies naturally threaten the delicate situation that they try so hard to take with a grain of salt, and their own friends and family become infected with the same feelings between each other. Heigl's sister, played by Leslie Mann, is in the most typical hetero marriage in the world: an unhappy one. And because of their close sibling relationship, their instabilities and uncertainties complement each other.Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen are hilarious together and Jonah Hill, whose natural over- the-topness works well in the subsequent Apatow/Rogen film Superbad, here playing one of Rogen's stoner friends, whips out many a razor-sharp laugh line. The dialogue in this film is so absorbing, hilarious, smart, rhythmic and quotable that David Mamet, Quentin Tarantino, Neil Simon, and Dashiell Hammett are surely seeking to visit Apatow for inspiration. No, I wouldn't rank Knocked Up with the likes of Glengarry Glen Ross, Pulp Fiction, The Goodbye Girl or To Have and Have Not, but it's certainly the cinematic speech beat for the present American pop culture. It has its fingers vigorously pressing against its pulse.I know I'm building this film up a wee bit, and I should in all fairness report that the movie struggles to begin. The first five minutes or so strike dread into one's heart because the rap blaring over the soundtrack, the shots of Rogen and his buddies partying, and Heigl's existing-condition life look like one's in for a simple coasting through Hollywood 16-to-25 age group fluff. Nevertheless it certainly overpowers its brief early expectation by a landslide.

Probably because there is something fundamentally poignant about watching people you deem hopeless stumbling toward responsibility, this movie reminds me of the old Natalie Wood/Steve McQueen dramedy, 1963's "Love With the Proper Stranger", about a Macy's salesgirl who gets impregnated by a ne'er-do-well jazz musician during a one-night stand and then tracks what happens afterward. However, this is the 21st century, and the girl is now an interviewer on E!, and the guy is a very non-McQueen-like slacker in this uproarious and quite humane 2007 comedy, the latest work from writer/director Judd Apatow ("The 40-Year-Old Virgin"). In both comedies, he manages an amazing balancing act between a raunchy, post-frat hilarity and a shrewdly observed social commentary. Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.The story looks at the outset like your standard Hollywood opposites-attract rom-com as it centers on the burgeoning relationship between Ben Stone, the perfectly named definition of a slacker, and Alison Scott, the beautiful entertainment reporter. They meet at a trendy LA bar where she is celebrating her promotion to on-air personality. Ben buys her a beer, and she is impressed enough by his unexpected chivalry to keep him company. One thing leads to another, and you can guess the rest. But what you can't guess so easily is how these characters respond to the situation and to each other. There is also a surrounding gallery of characters offering their own opinions about what is developing, in particular, Alison's acerbic older sister Debbie, who is facing a crisis of her own as the control-freak wife of passively dissatisfied husband Pete. Their story intertwines nicely with the main plot line to the point where each makes the other more resonant.Familiar faces from "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" return in this movie beginning with Seth Rogen, who proves he can carry a movie as Ben. Despite outward appearances to the contrary, his shaggy-dog demeanor and sometimes piercing self-deprecation provide much of the heart in the picture. As a last-minute substitute for Anne Hathaway, Katherine Heigl proves she can translate her natural likability on "Grey's Anatomy" to the big screen with ease. As Alison, she shows herself to be the rare actress who can be drop-dead gorgeous, smartly aware and genuinely non-judgmental. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann, who memorably demanded French toast while driving drunkenly through LA in "Virgin", is terrific as Debbie, an often-irritating mass of neuroses whom you somehow like despite herself. She has a great self-revelatory scene with a bouncer outside the same bar we see at the beginning. Paul Rudd plays Pete in his deceptively casual manner with a standout scene stoned in a Vegas hotel room.Harold Ramis has a nice small scene as Ben's proud dad, while Ben's friends are an assortment of slacker-types played out like a well-tuned improv troupe. My one complaint about the film is just some of the sluggish pacing toward the last third of the film, the same problem I had with "Virgin". A running time of 129 minutes seems a bit long for the story being told here, though the birthing scene is hilariously executed, in particular, a scene-stealing bit by Ken Jeong as the passive-aggressive gynecologist called on to deliver the baby at the last minute. One other minor irritant are the deliberate references to "Virgin" in some of the dialogue between Ben and Pete. Regardless, this is one smart, heartfelt character-driven farce that far exceeded my expectations.

Allison (Katherine Heigl) is a rising star in the entertainment television news business. Having just been promoted to an on-camera role, she is ready to party hearty and celebrate. Her sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann) is glad to help out, so the two of the them get dolled up and head for a trendy nightclub. Once there, Allison goes to the bar to buy some drinks but she has difficulty attracting the bartender's attention. Enter Ben (Seth Rogen). He helps Allison by arranging for her to get her beers without delay. Allsion is grateful and heads back to her table. Ben also returns to his circle of friends, where his pals chide him for not making more of a play for the obviously beautiful Allison. Bolstered by their suggestions, he approaches Allison again and they make a connection, albeit one that works better because of Allison's growing intoxication. They somehow end up spending the night together. But, in the morning, reality rears its ugly face. Allsion is a pretty lady with a great job and Ben is a consummate slacker with no ambitions or desire to change his present circumstances. Although they go their separate ways, fate throws them a curveball. Eight weeks later, Allsion learns that she is pregnant. Is there any possible future for Allison and Ben, that includes a baby? This is a very funny film, although the humor is as eyebrow-raising as it comes. The cast, quite large, is very nice, with Rogen doing a great job as the less-than-perfect suitor for Allison. Special mention should also be extended to Paul Rudd for his simply tremendous performance as Debbie's husband, a performance of humor and empathy. The whole production looks great, with well-picked costumes, scenery, and photography. Again, the script is the true champion here, as the story shines a bright, probing light on the realities of marriage, casual sex, money, and success. Although one would have to say, in the final analysis, that the film's conclusion is unrealistic, it is a very upbeat one, indeed. In essence, this is the brave new world of romantic comedy, told from the male perspective, as exhibited in such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin. As such, it is supremely funny and insightful but, if you prefer fun that is good and clean, you should pick another film, for this one treads into the limits of raunchiness.

As I lived part of my life in the US, both coasts. I was able to read between the lines of the dubbed-into-Italian breakthrough Judd Apatow comedy and laugh. Most people dismissed it at the movie theater in Rome where I saw it. Thought it was vulgar and old hat. Vulgar? The Italians of the Massimo Boldi comedies thought it was vulgar?! "Knocked Up", besides making me laugh out loud and amusing me no end taught me a really important cultural lesson. We, in Italy, ride a very high (non existent) horse. I think the time has come for us to get off the horse and start looking at ourselves for what we really are - like we used to in Dino Risi, Pietro Germi and Mario Monicelli's films. "Knocked Up" is ultra sophisticated and yet, it reached a vast audience in the States because the sophistication is so amazingly smart. Seth Rogen is a real find. His eyes when he realizes Katherinre Heigl is going to stay with him that first and fatal night made me fall in love with his unlikely character. Katherine Heigl is another incredible discovery. Superb and stunning and classy to boot. Now, all this praise and I haven't even seen it in its original English version. I can't wait.

I don't know. Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing 40 Year Old Virgin, and seeing the rating on this site. There were a lot of funny lines in the movie, but no hilarious ones. There weren't really any super funny scenes. No rich set-ups and pay-offs. No innovative photography. Was there a message? Must have missed it.Don't get me wrong, overall, I enjoyed it. I like the quirky quasi-ad-libbed style; it worked in The 40 Y.O.V., e.g. the donkey in Tijuana conversation. The problem is that this entire movie is scripted (or not) this way. I think it made the movie lose direction at times.My biggest disappointment was that I wanted to see a great comedy, but ended up seeing a so-so relationship movie.

I saw this recently and left with a stomach ache from laughing so hard. I watched 40 Year Old Virgin again to make a fair assessment, and i found this to be funnier. Don't get me wrong, I love all of Judd Apatow's work, but this to me was the best thing since Freaks & Geeks. Apatow has a brilliant way of letting the audience get to know all of the characters(anyone who has seen his stuff will know that it is a lot and usually the same people)which gives you the feeling that you are a part of what's going on, and makes you interested. By now, I am sure everyone is familiar with the plot summary. Couple meets, hooks up and surprise she's pregnant. I find it amusing that some of the previous comments mention that it it such an unbelievable concept. Well of course it is, it's a movie!!! But come on, is it not entirely true that someone would hook up on a celebratory night out with someone they normally wouldn't? Of course they would! Thus, the meeting of Alison( Ketherine Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen)seems so genuine and awkward. The aftermath is the best part though. Since this is a movie, trying to make the best out of a bad situation is a given. The getting to know someone AFTER they have gotten you pregnant, meeting family and friends, realizing the many differences you have, etc. All of this is explored is very realistic fashion, especially the emotion and the trying to have sex while six months along!! Of course the whole thing can't be comedy. With so many other characters to help take the focus off the main two, there will be parts of the story that are more "serious". True is the case towards the end with Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) having a falling out. This is a very nice, but what seems eternally long, scene about the importance of understanding in a relationship. Could that be the moral of our story Alison and Ben, understanding and acceptance? I think so. Naturally the only thing left is birth and the happily ever after. The hospital scene is definitely NOT for the squeamish. I really hope those parts are not cut from the movie, because they received some of the most reactions. I found this whole seen to be painfully realistic, more so than any other movie has dared to be. Finally, the happy ending is upon us and the closing credits are filled with family snapshots and even childhood photos of cast and crew, very cute. So to you the potential viewer I say that this is an exceptional comedy. It is definitely the funniest thing I have seen this year. I will definitely be seeing it again to see all the parts I missed while laughing. And I must say I was absolutely delighted to see both Martin Starr (do NOT leave the theater during the scenes with his girlfriend) and Loudon Wainwright. Put one more in the win column for Judd Apatow.

As it is irreverently and grossly hilarious, don't make the mistake of watching this with your parents. Seth Rogen (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) plays ultimate slacker Ben who gets the camera-friendly and otherwise level-headed E! News correspondent Alison (played by Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy) pregnant. Astonishingly, Alison decides to try and make it work with Ben despite having zilch in common, for their baby's sake.Rogen plays his character well, with no insecurity and with a wicked amount of confidence playing Heigl's unlikely beau. The kids who play Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete's (Paul Rudd) children are Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow's (the director) real children, and they are incredibly charming and deliver their lines without any annoying trace of self-consciousness.While Knocked Up is marketed as a comedy grossfest, it is surprisingly also much more. For the most part, it is shockingly funny but some might feel tricked to discover that there are more pockets of drama and romance than the target audience would normally sign up for.

My 17 year old daughter and I had been looking forward to the release of this movie for quite some time and we went on opening day. Both of us like Katherine Hiegl and we were looking forward to a witty, funny film. Instead, we both thought that there was a negative edge to all of the humor that relentlessly followed the cast of characters from scene to scene. The main male and his friends were all unkempt slackers and it was hard to find something to like about them. The drug use was annoying and excessive - are there adults out there who really behave like this? Every negative stereotype about pregnant women and women not accepting their aging gracefully had to be dragged into the plot. The one nice male seemed to love his spouse but was unable to communicate his interests or feelings toward her and seemed like such a wimp. Even the two studio executives were tired stereotypes that denigrate women. Did the characters really have to be so cynical and negative? With the exception of the two sisters, it didn't seem like any of the characters really liked each other or really wanted to be around the others. I think the excessive drug use and nasty attitude toward sex was annoying. It is interesting to see that both males and females under 45 are rating this film very closely and much higher than both males and females over 45. It's certainly not a movie that we will see again.

I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like "Mr. Woodcock" and "Good Luck Chuck," movies with no real craft to any of their jokes."Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!" "He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!" No. Die.Knocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works.

Although the subject matter wasn't really appealing to me, the critics and general audience reviews are right: this is a very well made movie. The acting is great, the plot fast-paced, the characters believable and the dialog witty and clever. It reminds me of Superbad - another movie that I would never normally see, but one which wins you over by it's sheer (albeit crude) brilliance.The basic premise is simple: a young TV reporter celebrates a promotion by getting drunk and inadvertently pregnant. The father-to-be is a good natured, pot-head slacker who has no money. When she decides to have the baby, she's not sure what her relationship with the father should be... and the movie progresses from there.It's a simple plot but the dialog is what makes this movie shine. No matter the scene, it was always fun to hear what the characters were going to say. Even though most of them were one-dimensional, the dialog made them seem human and easy to relate to. A fast-movie plot also kept the movie moving along - something was always happening and there was never a dull moment.While there is a certain level of crudity throughout, the movie is generally lighthearted and innocent. It's a fun movie to see.

I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, not having seen the trailer, and two hours later I felt I had seen a decent movie, quite funny at times, but I couldn't figure out what everyone was making such a big deal about. Compared to a lot of what passes for comedy in the cinema these days, Knocked Up is great, but it's hardly the "instant classic" that I've seen it called in many professional and IMDb reviews. It's certainly worth seeing, but maybe at a discount matinée instead of a full-price evening show.Much of what is wrong with Knocked Up is simply an over-reliance on Seth Rogen to deliver the laughs. To be sure, Rogen is a funny guy - he handled the jump from second-tier supporting actor (a la 40 Year Old Virgin) to leading man surprisingly well, appearing confident and charismatic. The problem is that as the film goes on, he just doesn't get a whole lot to work with from his supporting cast. Rogen doesn't have enough in him at this point to carry an entire film on his shoulders, but often he is forced into that role, providing the only humor in many scenes (especially in the second half of the movie). At times it almost seems as if Rogen has landed in the wrong film, delivering clever quips and laughs while the barely-likable characters around him remain too serious. Paul Rudd manages to break this up, taking some of the burden off Rogen, but Katherine Heigl and Leslie Mann's unfunny and quasi-sympathetic characters drag them down.To be sure, the first half of Knocked Up is great, but by the second half the script becomes mired in slow, cliché drama. Marital dissatisfaction and the loss of youth are interesting themes to explore, but in doing so, Knocked Up fails to establish a consistent tone. As the film trudges past the 90-minute mark, it is sometimes humorous, sometimes dour, often clichéd, all resulting in an awkward mix of styles.Overall, Knocked Up was a good effort, but a little more editing of the script would have helped a lot. I don't mind long movies at all, but 20 minutes could have been trimmed from this film to good effect.

This film is about a successful TV presenter who gets pregnant after a drunken one night stand."Knocked Up" tells a story that a lot of people fear, and a lot of people can relate to. The two individuals in the spotlight are very incompatible with each other, and yet they try to be in a relationship for the sake of the unborn baby. The film s funny at times, but most of the time the five pot heads are far too annoying to be entertaining. Watching them acting irresponsibly like spoiled teenagers is not my idea of comedy.I cannot help compare "Knocked Up" with "This Is 40", which is the sequel of this. I found "This Is 40" funny but fragmented; "Knocked Up" is cohesive but not so funny. I think it is over-hyped. If it wasn't for Katherine Heigl's charm and Leslie Mann's attitude, "Knocked Up" would have been a bore.

I enjoyed the show to be very honest
What I never liked was the total over the top excessive vulgar language which the characters blasted out Willy nilly
Several of the scenes were totally wasted and unnecessary and gives the feeling that they were just put in to puff out the movie to the over two hours
I would have given the movie a good 8 but the totally vile language that was sprouted makes me grade it actually as a 6
However what saves the day is the relevance of the subject and having experienced some of the things shown to he's a raw nerve with me
I did not enjoy the multitude of four letter words which in my opinion was very. Excessive
Why directors think that using four letter words and certain parts of a woman's anatomy is right or justified beggars belief
Using language like that just shows that the directors and writers are ignorant and that is the maximum of their thinking capacity
While the topics are relevant and identifiable and there are positive lessons to be taken out of the movie the bad language reduces the show to a free for all crude language grade C movie.Baby on Board with Heather Graham and Jerry O Connel was also rude and crude with some bad language several scenes of nudity but the message there was ultra clear and is a show I recommend when I talk snout the dangers of assumption
That show I would recommend a hundred times over Knocked Up
There are powerful messages that one can learn from in the movies but it's the rude crude and bad language that kills this movie for me
Another. Show that also involves bad language is THATS MY BOY with Adam Sandler
One of the least enjoyable shows of his
In many of his movies he also has bad language but not as bad as this show
It's worth watching if you can get past the bad language because it does have a decent and r elegant plot dealing with relationships though.

When Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is promoted in E! Television, she goes to a night-club to celebrate with her older married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). Alison meets the pothead reckless Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) and while having a small talk with him, Debbie's husband Pete (Paul Rudd) calls her to tell that their daughter has chickenpox. Debbie immediately leaves the place but Allison stays with Ben, drinking and dancing along all night; completely wasted, they end up having a one night stand. Ben does not use condom and eight weeks later, Allison discovers that she is pregnant. She calls Ben and they decide to try to stay together and have the baby. But the immatures Ben needs to grow-up first to raise a family of his own."Knocked Up" is a funny comedy and an entertaining romance with a charming cast. Seth Rogen and the gorgeous Katherine Heigl show a perfect chemistry with their charismatic characters, very well supported by Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, and I laughed a lot with the most hilarious situations. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Ligeiramente Grávidos" ("Slightly Pregnants")

"Knocked Up" is a well-made, enjoyable comedy about the consequences of an unprotected one-night stand. It has dual lessons for its lead characters: Seth Rogen has to learn to grow up and accept responsibility and Katherine Heigl has to choose between a professional life as a television interviewer or a possibly less rewarding (as she sees it) life as a stay-at-home mom.And because it's Judd Apatow, he handles the sex gags carefully and with enough maturity that it doesn't become another stale sex comedy. But I think some people jumping on the Apatow bandwagon are so eager to praise him as the "Savior" of the sex-comedy genre that they are overlooking some of the film's flaws.First of all, if we're going to be picky, the comedy isn't very consistent. Which is OK - I'd prefer it that way - but when you see reviews touting it as "the funniest movie of the year," expectations can't help but build.I didn't think the acting was as good as in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." Seth Rogen is a great supporting actor - but I find him rather irritating as a lead character. His revelation at the end of the film, too, isn't very believable - they spend so much time focusing on his life as a slacker that the transition between him being a man-child and accepting responsibility is as realistic as a "Rocky" training montage; he has a heartfelt talk with his dad (Harold Ramis) and suddenly he's 100% willing to become committed. Okay.I'm not a big Heigl fan, but she fit the role well here. Paul Rudd was the real scene-stealer, though. But he's thrown off-balance by the casting of Apatow's wife - can he PLEASE stop putting her in all his movies? She can't act.Overall, this is an OK comedy - better than most of its genre - and the drama is more realistic than most sex comedies, but some people were so willing to jump on it as a "masterpiece" of its genre before it even came out that the hype just killed it for me.

Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) at a bar, they get drunk and have a little fun afterward, then they part ways. That is, until a few weeks later, Alison discovers she's pregnant and Ben is the father. This simple story makes up the hilarious film Knocked Up. I really enjoyed this, it has a lot of great laughs and it also has a lot of heart spread throughout.Seth Rogen does an excellent job, I'm glad he's been given the chance to be the lead in such a big film. And Katherine Heigl is equally entertaining. The two of them are so great together, they're just so much fun to watch on screen. The supporting actors are also wonderful. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are perfect together. And I think Kristen Wiig steals the show with her small yet hysterical role as one of the workers at E!.When people go to see this they'll want to compare it with 40 Year Old Virgin. Though I'm not a big fan of comparing movies to other movies, I guess I'll have to go through with it. For me, 40 Year Old Virgin is a funnier movie, but Knocked Up is a better written film and it has more heart to it. Both films based their story on a simple premise (a nerdy 40 year old hasn't had sex, a guy has a one night stand and gets the woman pregnant), but it seems like 40 Year Old Virgin used its idea to just get laughs. Knocked Up, on the other hand, uses its set up and continues the story throughout the film, developing its characters.So, Knocked Up is a very enjoyable film, it has some big laughs (I particularly love the side story with the bearded roommate) but its also very sweet at times. I'm sure people will love it. See the movie and you'll get more than just laughs.

'Knocked-Up' was far better than I had hoped. I was not impress with the '40 Year-Old Virgin' or 'Superbad' which were crass and uninspiring. 'Knocked-Up' in stark contrast still maintains the adolescence humor of '40 Year-Old Virgin' or 'Superbad' but is far more intelligent and witty, bordering at times on comedic brilliance. It is also able to match the comedy with a sincere thread throughout, which is hard to achieve. Seth Rogen is great as the expectant father, I am unsure how much of the script was improvised but there were many moments of laugh-out-loud originality, the whole cast delivers on the acting front. At times the jokes can be a little too crude, but overall they are well managed. Special mention to the scene in the Las Vegas hotel between Rogen and Paul Rudd, high on mushrooms their interplay is spot-on and it is moments like this which make it memorable.The one criticism I do have is the last 30 minutes, the gags do not seem to work as well due to the more serious tone, and the film lumbers a little. I respect that the film wanted to make an emotional punch at the end but it dallied a little too long.'Knocked-Up' is an enjoyable film and I recommend that you make an effort to watch it.

From the title I expected an idiot-teen comedy, but it was quite a grown-up comedy. I envision teen boys liking the first 10 minutes (a chubby slacker gets to nail a hot chick after meeting her in a bar), then fleeing when the movie gets into REAL "adult themes". Uh-oh. She's pregnant. Now what happens? This movie kept the audience laughing throughout. Most comedies tend to fall apart part-way through, but this one kept the laughs going. It constantly surprises and never settles for the clichéd joke.There's more sex and nudity in this movie than you usually see in comedies, but it just makes the comedy more real. It's real -- so it's real funny. We've all found ourselves in awkward, yet hilarious, sexual situations like this. (Well, if you're lucky!) All the actors are comedy experts -- many of them from Judd Apatow's other ventures: "Undeclared" and "Freaks and Geeks". Steve Carell, star of Judd's "40 Year Old Virgin" has a cameo. As does Ryan Seacrest who plays himself as a total asshole. (Makes you wonder why he agreed to do this.) Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader from SNL are great in their small roles.Seth Rogan at first glance seems an unlikely leading man. But as the movie goes on, you grow to like him more. We see what the girl comes to see in him: he's funny and supportive and has a loving heart.She's a 10 and he's a 5, so at first you don't think they could make it as a couple, but looks can be deceiving.Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan at Cirque d'Soleil in an altered state is a hilarious scene. (That's how Cirque makes me feel when I see it anyway! Like a bad trip.)

Well, this flick IS better and more original than your average Hollywood fare. That's not saying much, though. I saw previews for five summer movies before seeing this film and all of them looked horrible. After seeing The 40-Year-Old Virgin I had high hopes for this movie, but it didn't measure up. I wasn't expecting them to be alike, but I hoped that Knocked Up would be as touching and funny.Unfortunately I found this movie inconsistent and the main relationship didn't make sense to me. The relationship between the two main characters seemed like wish fulfillment on the male director's or writer's part. I couldn't see her with him and I couldn't see her tolerating his teenage stoner lifestyle, however sweet he might be. It reminded me of that Seinfeld episode when George Costanza tells an attractive woman in the diner "I'm unemployed and I live with my parents" and she turns to him with interest and says "Hiiii!" or something like that.In contrast, the relationship in The 40-Year-Old Virgin was sweet, quirky, enjoyable and much more realistic. All the characters were great and the jokes in that movie came thick and fast. There were a number of very funny moments in this film too, but there were also scenes that were very unrealistic or boring--i.e., the one with the bouncer outside the club, and part of the Vegas scene. I really wanted to smack the married sister and tell her to get a life. If I were Paul Rudd's character I would have been out of there pronto.I did like it when the guys started to get into the back-and-forth insults that they used in TFYOV--I just wish there had been more of that. The two are both basically movies that accept and welcome nerdiness, quirkiness and difference, which is great. This one just didn't pull it off so well. I'd say, however, that if you're a teenage boy who likes to toke, you're going to love it!

Greetings again from the darkness. "Freaks and Geeks" lives on through multiple tie-ins - not the least of which is writer/director and producer Judd Apatow (best known for his smash hit "40 Year Old Virgin"). This is a sharp comedy and cutting insight thanks to a terrific script, excellent comedic timing from Seth Rogen and Apatow's feel for a scene.Rogen plays Ben Stone, a slacker who spends all his time smoking pot with his friends and conceptualizing an "informational" web site. One evening, while hanging with his buds in a club, he stumbles onto a ridiculously beautiful and ripe for the taking Katherine Heigl (Izzie from Grey's Anatomy). One thing leads to another and the next thing we know Heigl's character, Alison, is knocked up.It would be easy to classify this as a slapstick comedy in the mode of "Wedding Crashers", but in fact, Apatow's script offers up some insightful commentary on marriage, family and relationships of all types. Apatow's real life wife, Leslie Mann, plays Heigl's sister who dreams of the perfect marriage, but is crushed when she discovers her husband's secret (not what you think). Mann's "cheating" husband is played brilliantly by Paul Rudd ... who flashes a very nice DeNiro impersonation.The only weaknesses of the film are the shortage of scenes between Heigl and Rogen, and the fact that the film probably lasts 15 minutes too long. The whole Las Vegas sequence could have been cut. Still, this is not your typical comedy and please be prepared for some harsh (and loud) language and some very graphic visuals ... it is rated R for more than one reason! Apatow is creating his own look and feel and shows flashes of brilliant comedy writing. He could challenge the Cohen Brothers in the near future for the throne of off-beat comedy. Don't miss the fine songs from Loudon Wainwright III - especially the one playing over the closing credits.

A "fairly unattractive" man. Who smokes weed. Has no life. Living off a compensation benefit. Meets a "pretty" woman. At a club. They both get drunk. Have sex. Woman becomes pregnant...You get the drift, I could actually write this review in the same context all the way through. This is probably as close as to how the film has been constructed.I can't say that I enjoyed the "40 Year Old Virgin" in fact, I thought it was boring, crap storyline, segments were funny, with random scenes and locations which had no relevance to the film to fill in extra minutes for your money, and so on, so forth. This is EXACTLY what happens in "Knocked Up".What annoys me, is the fact that this film could of been so good. I wanted it to make that extra yard to make me fall out of my seat, so, so, so much. It just reminded me of crap sex, an ongoing ordeal that you think will come to something, and just when you think things are going your way, it all flops down.I can't completely slag this film though, as Seth Rogan shows what a talented actor he can be in funny situations. I think he will be one to watch out for in the future for sure. He has some brilliant one liners it has to be said! Katherine Heigl also done a blinding performance, its such a shame, because the storyline and little plot-holes completely screwed them both over. They are big actors for the big comic bound occasion, its a shame they were blindfolded and given shocking scenario's to work with.Of course it has its moments, but nothing that makes you go to pub with your mates and chat about it. I was very whole-heartedly disappointed with this film. So much speculation ruins a good thing ya' know? Possibly the most over-rated comedy of 2007. Yes. Down to the shoddy direction of the film. Absolutely. Possibly showcasing the new coming talent of comedies for the future. Maybe. With the right ingredients.

It's amazing to me how average low brow comedies like this show up in the top 250 ahead of real deserving movies such as "The Odd Couple", "Plains, Trains, and Automobiles", and "The Naked Gun", but I would guess thats because a lot of the teenage and college movie goers rate this one high . Anyway, I went to see this the other night and got a few laughs and a chuckle or two every once in a while. But it was hard for me to get past the notion that this beautiful, successful, career woman would want anything to do with a dopey, unemployed, bonghead who doesn't shave once in the entire movie. Just the fact that he tossed his condom away right before the moment and didn't tell her and she only gets a little upset and still wants to be with this guy? Ridiculous! Anyways if you want a few sophomoric laughs and decent acting, this is OK.

In director Judd Apatow's follow-up to his 2005 sleeper hit "The 40-year old virgin", Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a young and sexy TV presenter find herself pregnant after a one night-stand with Ben Stone, a twenty-something overweight unemployed pothead and looser living without any revenue with his stone-slackers roommates. Despite their differences, they try to make the best of the situation.Alfred Hitchcock once describe a kind of movie which are pleasant to watch and leave you satisfied when you go out from the theater but then, at midnight, when you open your fridge for a snack and think a little bit more about it, you realize it didn't really make sense and was nowhere as good as you thought it was. "Knocked up" is this kind of movie.It is entertaining, funny and well played but, on a second thought not very good. Part of the problem comes from the fact that Alison and Ben don't belong to the same movie. Alison and her family remain believable characters even though some aspects of their life and personalities are exaggerated for comedic purpose. On the other hand, Ben's entourage looks like castaways from "Napoleon dynamite" or some other over-the-top comedy and are totally unrealistic. This is particularly problematic for the character of Ben who interacts with both groups: hence, he sometimes appears as an outrageous caricature (as when he doesn't realize that it might not be very wise on a first date with a woman way out of your league to mention that you and your pothead friends are currently working on building a porn website. But since the porn website is how Alison later finds back Ben's trail, I suppose we can simply attribute that to lazy screen writing), other times as a more mature and reality-grounded character.Another problem is that Apatow seems to run out of ideas midway through the movie. Once Alison and Ben decide to keep the baby, they start dating and things go well. But ultimately, Alison breaks up with Ben. At this point, the movie just run into free wheels, Apatow wasting his time with comedic fillers bringing nothing to the plot so that, when it's time to come back to the plot, what should have been major development in the story are rushed out: when Ben finally graduates from retarded teenager to responsible adult, it is through a montage and, when it's time for Allison to give birth, Ben and her simply goes back together as if Alison's reasons for breaking from Ben in the first place never really mattered, a simple device to keep the plot boiling.Finally, this is probably the first movie where I saw product placement for another movie playing at the same time in the theater: "Spiderman 3", also produced by Sony and released just a few week before "Knocked up" in theaters, is referenced twice, the characters expressing their urgent desire to see it, and James Franco, who stars in "Spiderman 3", makes a cameo, appearing in Alison's TV show where he discusses, you guessed it, his role in "Spiderman 3"!

After watching Knocked Up I left with a feeling that I wanted SOMETHING more. Yes, it sure had good bits of that 40 Year Old Virgin type humor, and it was also a lot sweeter and more serious than 40 YOV...but that is where I think it failed. The movie had no identity.I wasn't sure how to handle the characters. Was I supposed to identify with them and take them seriously? Or was I supposed to laugh at how goofy they were? There was a little bit of both, but because of that I was never really able to get into the groove of it. In this case two halves did NOT make a whole.Sure, it was good for a few laughs, the acting was fine (not outstanding), the production was fine (again, not outstanding)...but I don't think it was worth seeing in the theaters. It just left me in limbo...I couldn't really get into the comedy because these were SERIOUS issues they explored, and I also couldn't take the characters and their problems as seriously as I wanted to because of the wacky 40 YOV humor. Knocked Up tried to be two things at once, and because of that it lost lots of power on both sides of the coin.Maybe people like this new kind of "half comedy"...but I couldn't really get into it. And it just seemed to drag ON AND ON. Especially because from what I heard there was supposed to be constant gut busting humor...but to be honest, I don't think this is nearly as good as 40 YOV, because it takes itself too seriously. You knew what 40 YOV was from the start, right up the goofy song ending...they kept you in that comedy mode. But Knocked Up seemed to get caught in no man's land to me...and just couldn't satisfy either my want for comedy or my want for romance/drama.Overall it's not a bad film, but I'd wait for it on DVD and a lazy, rainy day :)

Granted there are a few funny moments in this film, but it really lacks the warmth (and dare I say heart) of say, 40 Year Old Virgin. Seth Rogen is too grimy to ever really be likable, the rest of the performances are average at best. As a whole the flimsy storyline is pretty darn bad, let's face it.What worries me is the film's messages. 1. That it's OK to smoke bongs all day and be a perpetual underachiever, and 2. that unplanned pregnancies end happily ever after.Sorry, but a film whose laughs come from a 6 year a old girl saying "penis" and "prick" is an insult to everyone's intelligence.

Knocked Up did its applaudably, insightfully wise job. It lured its conventional teen target consumers into a hard-to-miss universal social commentary. It is stunningly enlightening and intelligent, not in a vernacular or high-brow sense but emboldeningly sharp in its assertion of wisdom and sensibility within the mainstream American culture of regular pop culture-driven people of today.Judd Apatow is so honest and wise in his portrayal of the all-American knocked-up situation, that everything makes sense despite how stupid things are. Take for example the most obvious and necessary scene in the movie, which is when Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl get drunk and wind up at her house having sex. Rogen is battling to maintain an erection and fit a condom on while keeping the pace. Heigl gets impatient and says, "Just do it!" Of course, she's trying to speed up the fastening of the condom. But also of course, he interprets that as "Forget the condom, let's go." This clearly pivotal moment in the movie could so easily have been botched.Apatow is very much above the stick figure story. See, a lot of the time when Hollywood wants to make a commercial movie with a message pertaining to an oft-confronted conflict in or because of American culture, they simply take a classic scenario and fill in the blanks, which would just be character names, place, et cetera. Knocked Up begins with its characters. It also sets the stage for hilarity at their expense. Rogen is not just a horny American Pie party animal. He's an immature Jewish Canadian who is building a website of all the great nudie film scenes with his LA pothead friends. He lives there and doesn't pay taxes, living on an injury settlement. Heigl is a competent, together, motivated woman who is promoted anchorwoman for E! TV and lives with her sister, who is married with a family. She goes to a nightclub because she is rewarding herself with a good time and he goes to the same nightclub because he and his friends spontaneously decided to go. This pairing is an extremely socially and psychologically perceptive comic manipulation. Their occupations and immediate social personalities are specifically and deeply opposing.It's not just a farce, however. It takes itself seriously. Seth Rogen's character's personality is actually a good model for describing the climate of the film. It's hilarious with a whip-smart sense of timing and comeback, yet it isn't simply a breezy clown because there's so much aggression and passion behind it's sense of humor. This leaves room for the most comfortable and considerate poignancy in a Hollywood movie directed at young people in years. All of the couple's fears and mutually irritating idiosyncracies naturally threaten the delicate situation that they try so hard to take with a grain of salt, and their own friends and family become infected with the same feelings between each other. Heigl's sister, played by Leslie Mann, is in the most typical hetero marriage in the world: an unhappy one. And because of their close sibling relationship, their instabilities and uncertainties complement each other.Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen are hilarious together and Jonah Hill, whose natural over- the-topness works well in the subsequent Apatow/Rogen film Superbad, here playing one of Rogen's stoner friends, whips out many a razor-sharp laugh line. The dialogue in this film is so absorbing, hilarious, smart, rhythmic and quotable that David Mamet, Quentin Tarantino, Neil Simon, and Dashiell Hammett are surely seeking to visit Apatow for inspiration. No, I wouldn't rank Knocked Up with the likes of Glengarry Glen Ross, Pulp Fiction, The Goodbye Girl or To Have and Have Not, but it's certainly the cinematic speech beat for the present American pop culture. It has its fingers vigorously pressing against its pulse.I know I'm building this film up a wee bit, and I should in all fairness report that the movie struggles to begin. The first five minutes or so strike dread into one's heart because the rap blaring over the soundtrack, the shots of Rogen and his buddies partying, and Heigl's existing-condition life look like one's in for a simple coasting through Hollywood 16-to-25 age group fluff. Nevertheless it certainly overpowers its brief early expectation by a landslide.

Probably because there is something fundamentally poignant about watching people you deem hopeless stumbling toward responsibility, this movie reminds me of the old Natalie Wood/Steve McQueen dramedy, 1963's "Love With the Proper Stranger", about a Macy's salesgirl who gets impregnated by a ne'er-do-well jazz musician during a one-night stand and then tracks what happens afterward. However, this is the 21st century, and the girl is now an interviewer on E!, and the guy is a very non-McQueen-like slacker in this uproarious and quite humane 2007 comedy, the latest work from writer/director Judd Apatow ("The 40-Year-Old Virgin"). In both comedies, he manages an amazing balancing act between a raunchy, post-frat hilarity and a shrewdly observed social commentary. Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.The story looks at the outset like your standard Hollywood opposites-attract rom-com as it centers on the burgeoning relationship between Ben Stone, the perfectly named definition of a slacker, and Alison Scott, the beautiful entertainment reporter. They meet at a trendy LA bar where she is celebrating her promotion to on-air personality. Ben buys her a beer, and she is impressed enough by his unexpected chivalry to keep him company. One thing leads to another, and you can guess the rest. But what you can't guess so easily is how these characters respond to the situation and to each other. There is also a surrounding gallery of characters offering their own opinions about what is developing, in particular, Alison's acerbic older sister Debbie, who is facing a crisis of her own as the control-freak wife of passively dissatisfied husband Pete. Their story intertwines nicely with the main plot line to the point where each makes the other more resonant.Familiar faces from "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" return in this movie beginning with Seth Rogen, who proves he can carry a movie as Ben. Despite outward appearances to the contrary, his shaggy-dog demeanor and sometimes piercing self-deprecation provide much of the heart in the picture. As a last-minute substitute for Anne Hathaway, Katherine Heigl proves she can translate her natural likability on "Grey's Anatomy" to the big screen with ease. As Alison, she shows herself to be the rare actress who can be drop-dead gorgeous, smartly aware and genuinely non-judgmental. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann, who memorably demanded French toast while driving drunkenly through LA in "Virgin", is terrific as Debbie, an often-irritating mass of neuroses whom you somehow like despite herself. She has a great self-revelatory scene with a bouncer outside the same bar we see at the beginning. Paul Rudd plays Pete in his deceptively casual manner with a standout scene stoned in a Vegas hotel room.Harold Ramis has a nice small scene as Ben's proud dad, while Ben's friends are an assortment of slacker-types played out like a well-tuned improv troupe. My one complaint about the film is just some of the sluggish pacing toward the last third of the film, the same problem I had with "Virgin". A running time of 129 minutes seems a bit long for the story being told here, though the birthing scene is hilariously executed, in particular, a scene-stealing bit by Ken Jeong as the passive-aggressive gynecologist called on to deliver the baby at the last minute. One other minor irritant are the deliberate references to "Virgin" in some of the dialogue between Ben and Pete. Regardless, this is one smart, heartfelt character-driven farce that far exceeded my expectations.

Allison (Katherine Heigl) is a rising star in the entertainment television news business. Having just been promoted to an on-camera role, she is ready to party hearty and celebrate. Her sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann) is glad to help out, so the two of the them get dolled up and head for a trendy nightclub. Once there, Allison goes to the bar to buy some drinks but she has difficulty attracting the bartender's attention. Enter Ben (Seth Rogen). He helps Allison by arranging for her to get her beers without delay. Allsion is grateful and heads back to her table. Ben also returns to his circle of friends, where his pals chide him for not making more of a play for the obviously beautiful Allison. Bolstered by their suggestions, he approaches Allison again and they make a connection, albeit one that works better because of Allison's growing intoxication. They somehow end up spending the night together. But, in the morning, reality rears its ugly face. Allsion is a pretty lady with a great job and Ben is a consummate slacker with no ambitions or desire to change his present circumstances. Although they go their separate ways, fate throws them a curveball. Eight weeks later, Allsion learns that she is pregnant. Is there any possible future for Allison and Ben, that includes a baby? This is a very funny film, although the humor is as eyebrow-raising as it comes. The cast, quite large, is very nice, with Rogen doing a great job as the less-than-perfect suitor for Allison. Special mention should also be extended to Paul Rudd for his simply tremendous performance as Debbie's husband, a performance of humor and empathy. The whole production looks great, with well-picked costumes, scenery, and photography. Again, the script is the true champion here, as the story shines a bright, probing light on the realities of marriage, casual sex, money, and success. Although one would have to say, in the final analysis, that the film's conclusion is unrealistic, it is a very upbeat one, indeed. In essence, this is the brave new world of romantic comedy, told from the male perspective, as exhibited in such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin. As such, it is supremely funny and insightful but, if you prefer fun that is good and clean, you should pick another film, for this one treads into the limits of raunchiness.

As I lived part of my life in the US, both coasts. I was able to read between the lines of the dubbed-into-Italian breakthrough Judd Apatow comedy and laugh. Most people dismissed it at the movie theater in Rome where I saw it. Thought it was vulgar and old hat. Vulgar? The Italians of the Massimo Boldi comedies thought it was vulgar?! "Knocked Up", besides making me laugh out loud and amusing me no end taught me a really important cultural lesson. We, in Italy, ride a very high (non existent) horse. I think the time has come for us to get off the horse and start looking at ourselves for what we really are - like we used to in Dino Risi, Pietro Germi and Mario Monicelli's films. "Knocked Up" is ultra sophisticated and yet, it reached a vast audience in the States because the sophistication is so amazingly smart. Seth Rogen is a real find. His eyes when he realizes Katherinre Heigl is going to stay with him that first and fatal night made me fall in love with his unlikely character. Katherine Heigl is another incredible discovery. Superb and stunning and classy to boot. Now, all this praise and I haven't even seen it in its original English version. I can't wait.

I don't know. Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing 40 Year Old Virgin, and seeing the rating on this site. There were a lot of funny lines in the movie, but no hilarious ones. There weren't really any super funny scenes. No rich set-ups and pay-offs. No innovative photography. Was there a message? Must have missed it.Don't get me wrong, overall, I enjoyed it. I like the quirky quasi-ad-libbed style; it worked in The 40 Y.O.V., e.g. the donkey in Tijuana conversation. The problem is that this entire movie is scripted (or not) this way. I think it made the movie lose direction at times.My biggest disappointment was that I wanted to see a great comedy, but ended up seeing a so-so relationship movie.

I saw this recently and left with a stomach ache from laughing so hard. I watched 40 Year Old Virgin again to make a fair assessment, and i found this to be funnier. Don't get me wrong, I love all of Judd Apatow's work, but this to me was the best thing since Freaks & Geeks. Apatow has a brilliant way of letting the audience get to know all of the characters(anyone who has seen his stuff will know that it is a lot and usually the same people)which gives you the feeling that you are a part of what's going on, and makes you interested. By now, I am sure everyone is familiar with the plot summary. Couple meets, hooks up and surprise she's pregnant. I find it amusing that some of the previous comments mention that it it such an unbelievable concept. Well of course it is, it's a movie!!! But come on, is it not entirely true that someone would hook up on a celebratory night out with someone they normally wouldn't? Of course they would! Thus, the meeting of Alison( Ketherine Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen)seems so genuine and awkward. The aftermath is the best part though. Since this is a movie, trying to make the best out of a bad situation is a given. The getting to know someone AFTER they have gotten you pregnant, meeting family and friends, realizing the many differences you have, etc. All of this is explored is very realistic fashion, especially the emotion and the trying to have sex while six months along!! Of course the whole thing can't be comedy. With so many other characters to help take the focus off the main two, there will be parts of the story that are more "serious". True is the case towards the end with Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) having a falling out. This is a very nice, but what seems eternally long, scene about the importance of understanding in a relationship. Could that be the moral of our story Alison and Ben, understanding and acceptance? I think so. Naturally the only thing left is birth and the happily ever after. The hospital scene is definitely NOT for the squeamish. I really hope those parts are not cut from the movie, because they received some of the most reactions. I found this whole seen to be painfully realistic, more so than any other movie has dared to be. Finally, the happy ending is upon us and the closing credits are filled with family snapshots and even childhood photos of cast and crew, very cute. So to you the potential viewer I say that this is an exceptional comedy. It is definitely the funniest thing I have seen this year. I will definitely be seeing it again to see all the parts I missed while laughing. And I must say I was absolutely delighted to see both Martin Starr (do NOT leave the theater during the scenes with his girlfriend) and Loudon Wainwright. Put one more in the win column for Judd Apatow.

As it is irreverently and grossly hilarious, don't make the mistake of watching this with your parents. Seth Rogen (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) plays ultimate slacker Ben who gets the camera-friendly and otherwise level-headed E! News correspondent Alison (played by Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy) pregnant. Astonishingly, Alison decides to try and make it work with Ben despite having zilch in common, for their baby's sake.Rogen plays his character well, with no insecurity and with a wicked amount of confidence playing Heigl's unlikely beau. The kids who play Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete's (Paul Rudd) children are Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow's (the director) real children, and they are incredibly charming and deliver their lines without any annoying trace of self-consciousness.While Knocked Up is marketed as a comedy grossfest, it is surprisingly also much more. For the most part, it is shockingly funny but some might feel tricked to discover that there are more pockets of drama and romance than the target audience would normally sign up for.

My 17 year old daughter and I had been looking forward to the release of this movie for quite some time and we went on opening day. Both of us like Katherine Hiegl and we were looking forward to a witty, funny film. Instead, we both thought that there was a negative edge to all of the humor that relentlessly followed the cast of characters from scene to scene. The main male and his friends were all unkempt slackers and it was hard to find something to like about them. The drug use was annoying and excessive - are there adults out there who really behave like this? Every negative stereotype about pregnant women and women not accepting their aging gracefully had to be dragged into the plot. The one nice male seemed to love his spouse but was unable to communicate his interests or feelings toward her and seemed like such a wimp. Even the two studio executives were tired stereotypes that denigrate women. Did the characters really have to be so cynical and negative? With the exception of the two sisters, it didn't seem like any of the characters really liked each other or really wanted to be around the others. I think the excessive drug use and nasty attitude toward sex was annoying. It is interesting to see that both males and females under 45 are rating this film very closely and much higher than both males and females over 45. It's certainly not a movie that we will see again.
