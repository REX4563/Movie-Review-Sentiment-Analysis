8MM is a very dark, disturbing film that isn't for everyone. Nicolas Cage puts in an excellent performance as a private detective named Tom Welles who is hired to investigate whether a snuff film is real or acted.  His journey takes him farther and farther into the realm of pornography. Every minute of this film is suspenseful and riveting.  I also found Joaquin Phoenix's performance to be outstanding as well.  This movie does a wonderful job of creating a dark mood and exploring the motives and drives behind its characters.  One of Cage's best, and a severely under-rated film.

Firstly, this film is hugely under-rated. For those reviewers who call this film a "waste of time" or place it in the "hall of shame", maybe they should go back to watching more obvious and simple films. 8mm focuses on "snuff" movies and follows Nicholas Cage as he ventures into the dark underworld of the pornographic industry. I'm not a great fan of Nicholas Cage (I still wonder how he ever made it as a movie star), but in 8mm felt he redeemed himself from past performances. Other actors in the film put on great performances, notably Joaquin Pheonix, and James Gandolfini (of Sopranos).What makes the film worth watching though is the emotion, dark imagery and tense moments throughout the film. The storyline too is very well thought out although does have a few holes and untouched areas that may have helped develop the film further. There is no Hollywood ending, forced propaganda, or marketing. What you do get is graphic scenes, moderate violence, and an insight into "snuff" movies (which really is quite disturbing).Having said that this movie is not for the faint hearted, so if you're a "puppy-dogs and ice-cream" kind of person I'd suggest watching something else. If however, you feel you will be able to stomach such a film then prepare yourself for a moving film, which will leave you feeling that little bit darker at the end.I highly recommend this film. 8/10

When I watched 8 MM, I didn't know what to expect, but I noticed that Joel Schumacher directed it and I am a fan of his. Also it stars two other terrific actors like Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, so usually that equals a great film. 8 MM turned out to be a terrific dark drama that I'm not so sure that I understand it's low rating. I was actually expecting it to be in the 7.0 range when I went to check it out on IMDb, but it's in the low 6.0's. I understand that it's an extremely dark movie that not too many people would wanna take a look at, but for what it was, I thought it was great. It took us into the deep dark world of porn and what some sick people get off on. It's not just about that, but also it takes us into a detective type of drama that makes it into a scary type of thriller.Tom Welles is a detective that is given a strange short movie called a "snuff film", where a beautiful young girl is being brutally raped and then murdered on film. While it's supposed to be fake, it looks incredibly real and terrifying. Her relative asks him to find out wither it is fake or real and if she's still alive. This means he has to go deep into a world of brutal porn that is out of his league. With the help of a porn salesman, Max, they go to find out if this girl is really alive or not, but end up getting into some serious trouble when the directors and "actors" find out about them.8 MM is in no way for the faint of heart, there are some extremely disturbing images that I really wouldn't like to see again, I'm sure most wouldn't either, but this is a great dark drama that I would recommend for a watch. Nicholas did a great job, but Joaquin really takes the show here. He made his character incredibly believable and almost sympathetic. Joel really made me believe the story, he shot it wonderfully and didn't over do anything. I would recommend this film for a watch, it's a great thriller that is impressive as well as scary.8/10

I walked into the movie theater last Friday not expecting at all what I was about to see. I'd heard about it, thought "Oh, another Seven". Same screenwriter, but I was way off track. I can stomach a lot, having no problem stuffing down popcorn during very graphic scenes. In 8MM, my coke had trouble going down. 8MM did not have consistent gory/violent scenes, but the way the movie was made made you fill in the blanks of what the makers of the movie could not screen. And if you pay attention and immerse yourself, you fill in more blanks than you really think you could, or want. As Max put it: "the devil changes you." The perversity and deep rottenness of the human minds displayed in 8MM is what disturbs you. Then you realize, that "snuff"-movies are real, that there are individuals twisted enough to endorse/enjoy/take part in it. And worst of all, that these individuals don't look like monsters, they're perhaps just overweight nearsighted men who look like your dad, your son, your brother, even yourself. And if you don't look out,(no matter how secluded you think you are in your suburban home, with a wife, a daughter, and a dog named Shep) you dive into the pit of perversion and rottenness as well, finding no way out. In conclusion: excellent music, acting very sufficient, the plot: a must see. Just don't bring popcorn, and prepare to walk out of the movie theatre disturbed, asking questions, and a little bit more suspicious of those walking around you, and yourself.

Every time I think of Joel Schumacher I cringe. Is Batman & Robin really so bad that it makes me want to disregard the rest of his films? He's not a bad director, hell I enjoy some of his work, yet I still cringe when I hear his name. Let's take a look at 8MM, something that is the polar opposite of B&R.It stars Nic Cage as a private investigator, hired to find out if the content on an 8MM tape found in a safe of a recently deceased millionaire is real. The tape is referred to as a snuff film, which is a pornographic film that ends with the murder of the female. So, already we have ourselves a pretty dark and disturbing film here. Yet, as I watched it I felt that is played it a little too safe.Upon research you will find out the writer and the director had a falling out over the film. The studio wanted it to be a bit lighter, and the director agreed. While the writer, who also wrote Se7en, wanted to keep the gritty disturbing feel he had originally wrote. The final product is a film that tries to be more hardcore then it actually is.Nic Cage really seemed to be playing by the numbers here. He is more monotone then usual I thought and didn't really seem invested in his character. Joaquin Phoenix on the other hand immerses himself into this world. Playing the sidekick who is smarter then he looks. The supporting cast also includes James Gandolfini, doing what he does best and Peter Stormare. Both stretch out beyond the page and embody their characters. With Gandolfini, we've seen him do this character before. But with every performance there is just one little thing that makes them all seem different every time.I was really underwhelmed with this flick. It was a bit longer then it needed to be, just over 2 hours. You go along for the investigative ride and are interested with the story, but at the end you just feel empty. Never connecting with the relationship between the main character and his wife he neglects. Some scenes that were meant to be powerful came off as comedic to me, specifically the "Give me permission to hurt them" bit near the end.I did enjoy the film, but wanted more. The ingredients were there to make a really good film, but the final product falls a bit flat. It's a rental, or if you are really a big fan of anyone involved . I will say this though, I wouldn't mind if Cage went back to making movies like this instead of the filler he's been cranking out the last few years.

Some sensitive-minded people may surely be disturbed by the dark revenge and self-justice in this film, but "Se7en"-author Andrew Kevin Walker has done another fine work with his script! Although the storyline is obviously taken from Paul Schrader´s "Hardcore" (1974,?) the film is suspense-packed, violent and endowed with good performances of its actors, especially Peter Stormare did a brilliant job with playing the weird bondage-porn director Dino Velvet! I also was truly surprised how good director Joel Schumacher had created a morbid atmosphere, just in unhappy memory of his disastrous "Batman & Robin"-flick..! Another pleasant fact is, that "8MM" doesn´t deal with the Hollywood-typical stereotypes and clichés, so finally we´ve got something we could really call a dirty mainstream production - or at least a nice try of it!

Wow, this is a tough subject but not as sordid a film as I figured it would be, although be warned the last 30 minutes are really rough in spots. Speaking of spots, this is a bloody movie in spots, too and very profane after the first 40 minutes. Yet, despite the unpleasant nature of the story (making a "snuff film" - filming the killing of people) it's a riveting one, well-acted and doesn't overdo the violence. The characters in here are some of the most despicable you could find - killer and porn kings.Even our hero here, played by Nicholas Cage, starts off as a clean-cut fairly straight dude, and changes for the worst, too. Joaquin Phoenix has a good line in here, with the prophetic statement, "The devil doesn't change; he changes you."James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare play characters about as bad you'll ever find in a movie. This film is not, as they say, for all tastes. It will turn off a lot of people but it is interesting and good revenge story, if you like that sort of thing and know what you're in for before watching this.

When it came out, "8mm" became notorious for its dark and perverted subject matter. Any and all warnings that are given in association with this film are warranted: this is a dark, dark, thriller, and one that revels in a lot of sordid subject matter. How this was never threatened with an NC-17 is beyond me.Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a well-respected private detective. One day, he gets a call from a recently widowed, and exceedingly wealthy woman named Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter). It seems that when Mrs. Christian was going through her husbands things, she came across a film reel that appears to be a "snuff film" (a "snuff film is where someone is actually murdered on screen, not merely acting like it). Tom is hired to find out if the film is actually real.Andrew Kevin Walker wrote the suspense hit "Seven," and the two films bear a number of similarities. Both deal with grisly and bizarre subject matter, and take no prisoners when they show it all. But "Seven" had something that "8mm" doesn't: a sense of atmosphere. Try as he might, director Joel Schumaker can't establish an ominous atmosphere, which mutes the film's impact.The acting varies. Nicholas Cage is effective as Tom Welles, though that's to be expected because this is a role that Cage could play in his sleep. Joaquin Phoenix shines as Max California, the porn star clerk who becomes Tom's sidekick. The rest of the cast is not so great. James Gandolfini is okay as Eddie Poole, but Peter Stormare (Dino Velvet, a mysterious hard-core porn producer), Anthony Heald as Mrs. Christian's lawyer, Daniel Longdale, (looking strikingly similar to Geraldo Rivera) and Catherine Keener (Tom's neurotic wife)are awful."8mm" works, but it's not masterpiece. The story is easy to follow, as long as you don't stop to think about how the film gets from one scene to the next. But the final 20 minutes are bad; they're not credible, and everyone acts like they've lost their brains."Seven" contained an ingenious twist ending, and while "8mm" doesn't offer that, it takes a few unexpected turns, and the story is not formulaic.This is a good film, but not a great one. Recommended, if you can get it for cheap.

I'll never forget first seeing this film in the theater.  When I heard that this film was written by the same writer as "Seven", I expected a truly sick and twisted film.  Now don't get me wrong, this most certainly is a sick and twisted film, but it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected.  Maybe that is due to this film having a different director, but nonetheless the film wasn't as graphic as I'd expected.  With that said, and having watched this film a number of times, I still wouldn't recommend this film to everyone. If you like thrillers and can handle the subject of pornography and "snuff" films, then you should definitely give this film a chance.I'm a little surprised that this film has such a low rating on IMDB.  I can see why someone wouldn't like it, but I can't see why it would have such a low rating.  I would assume that most viewers couldn't handle the subject and therefore gave the film a low rating.All of the actors involved in this film did a very good job.  Nicholas Cage was great as always (sometimes a little over-acting, but most of the time he was great).  James Gandolfini, Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Storemare, Anthony Heald, Catherine Keener, and the rest of the supporting cast all pulled off solid performances.Joel Schumacher really needs to stick with films like this.  He really does a great job with thriller/drama type films (and needs to steer clear of certain super-hero films).  Joel did a great job with this film and I look forward to his next work.The only complaint I have about the film is the music.  There were some times were the music was perfect or tolerable, but there were others where it was just horrible and detracted from the film.  Some of the music in the film was too bizarre and didn't fit with the film.Like I said, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I thought this was an excellent film.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris

This movie deserves higher than a 6.5/10.This is a very dark and disturbing movie. Along the lines of Se7en. This honestly makes a good companion piece to it. This is the dark underbelly of the world. This is evil.The movie keeps you invested throughout.The soundtrack is very unusual at parts and doesn't go with the movie at all.Sidenote: has James Gandolfini ever not played a scumbag?

"8MM" starts off strong but implodes at the end, unfortunately defeating the credit most of the film offers.Nicholas Cage plays Tom Welles, a Private Investigator hired by the widow of an industrial magnate (Myra Carter) and her lawyer (Anthony Heald) to examine if a "snuff" film found in her late husband's safe is real. The snuff is terrifying; it features a man in a leather mask stabbing a young teen (Jenny Powell), who has been reported missing. In order to discover the truth, Welles must enlist aid from Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), a porn store clerk, as they travel through the depths of human perversion and encounter villains in the "alternative" porn industry, including Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini), and Machine (Christopher Bauer), a twisted S&M fetish killer.Max California is by far the most interesting character in "8MM." Both the script and Phoenix's acting allow the audience to peer into the mind of the smut store worker, whom we sympathize with because he is good comic relief and a lonely type, working in this wasteland only to support his unsuccessful music career. Max delivers some lines expressing how the pornography industry lured him into this hell and how it is impossible to escape. In fact, Max upstages Cage's detective Welles, who is possibly the most boring person in the film. The script provides no back-story or personality for our protagonist, nor any insights into his mind. Welles's only redemption is Cage's able acting.Another great role is that of Machine, a psycho who wears a crude leather mask. Before we learn anything about Machine, he makes a fascinating maniac. Is he an evil freak with a mental illness? Is he a seemingly everyday man with a split personality? Either way, Machine is an ominous monster. Then, the screenplay goes so far as to ruin our intrigue. Rather than leave his identity to the imagination, we actually get to see Machine for who he really is. In an anti-climatic fight for life, the haunting mask is removed, accompanied with cartoonish, moronic dialogue that was intended to be witty. The revelation of Machine for who he really was is intended to be ironic and surprising, but this cliched scene was so not clever that I felt a surge of disappointment and anger at how "8MM" had degraded since it began. "8MM" mainly succeeds at presenting a disturbing, sickening tour through the corrupted minds of pornography addicts. Welles and Max actually go to a secret subterranean dungeon where illegal porn trade is dealt. Stunning and horrifying are two adjectives that describe this culture of filth. Almost every type of sex is produced and purchased here: bestiality, child porn, mutilation, fake and gory snuff, hermaphrodites, brutal S&M, etc. In one scene, several men masturbate to a female doctor, breasts exposed, stabbing a man in the buttocks with a syringe. A blow to one's mind and stomach are packaged into this film. It's overwhelming to realize that in the chasms of civilized human society, there are a few vile minds who resort to this abhorrent "entertainment" for pleasure.However, all of this powerful terror collapses in the last 45 minutes. All the villains come together against Welles in an over-the-top, half-witted battle with lame, corny gothic overtones. Everyone hugely overacts this scene, most noticeably Peter Stormare's Dino Velvet who has some cheesy lines to deliver ("Kill them, Machine! Kill them all!). Also, one person's appearance as an adversary is not the least bit shocking. In fact, the first time this character was introduced I said to myself, "He's a bad guy." This big rendezvous, no matter how poorly executed, should have ended the film. Instead, Welles runs away to his house rather than killing the unarmed bad guys. When the screenplay finally calls upon our protagonist to wrap up the movie, your interest has already faltered because the film should have ended 20 minutes ago. There's once scene when Welles has a killer tied up. The good guy has a gun, the bad guy is helpless. During this episode, the killer incessantly and obnoxiously explodes into outbursts of bloodthirsty insults about his killing of an innocent. Welles is being tortured by the taunts, but he doesn't shoot the murderer. What he does is runs to his car and moans. This is a perfect example of painfully stupid false endings "8MM" offers.Eventually, the phony conclusions, over-acting, naïve showdowns, predictability, and boring personas bring "8MM" down.

There is a lot to be said about skill. Joel Schumacher is responsible for Batman & Robin, one of the most horrendously made movies in the past 15 years. One could have said upon leaving the theater in 1997 that Joel Schumacher is one of the worst directors working today. Two years later, Schumacher creates something, albeit with commercial sensibilities, that succeeds on many levels. 8mm is a murky, scuzzy passage through the miserable, dystopian criminal world of snuff films, taken on by a private investigator who is dismayed and scarred by what he unearths. It probes the resources of violent exploitation films, but not as a violent exploitation film. It would more accurately turn your stomach than amuse. Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote Seven, and again establishes a protagonist who confronts evil and nearly loses his sanity in an effort to understand its reasons. The answer comes almost at the end of the film, from its most vicious character, but his rationale wittingly refrains from going as deep as the psychological world of his deeds. Joel Schumacher has an attraction to sinister, perhaps Gothic environments, even if his previous films that follow that pattern aren't so great, like The Lost Boys. Here, with Mychael Danna's sorrowful score and the great Robert Elswit's guilty, peeping camera, he fashions an impression of apprehension even in the few scenes where the story takes solace in Cage's home life. One director would not be wrong to shock us with a comparison to the unsuspecting atmosphere of Cage's residential street or the opening airport shot, but Schumacher perceives the looming subterranean goings-on beneath the unsuspecting.The intent of the story is to consider a rather everyday individual and provoke him into such a troubling conflict with pure evil that he himself is pushed to torture and murder. He lives an unexciting but mostly happy life with his wife Catherine Keener and their infant daughter. He went to a good school on an academic scholarship, however while his contemporaries went through the most conventional motions to become lawyers, doctors, bankers, he chose a line of work comprised of following, shadowing, investigating, staking out, watching. For the sake of a comfortable living, he accommodates an upper crust circle of socialites and politicians. Nevertheless, this case which he almost does not take is unique. He is sent for by the attorney of a rich widow whose husband has just died. Whilst rummaging through the inside of her husband's safe, she and the lawyer find an 8 mm film of what seems to be the vicious slaying of a teenage girl by a large masked man. Cage convinces himself that the film, while horrifying, is simulation, but the widow wants him to confirm this for sure.8mm doesn't consider the story's dilemmas merely as opportunity for money-making set pieces like action scenes. When Cage has the chance to take revenge, he doesn't have the command of his motivation because he does not have the same capacity for murder that his prospective victims have, and he essentially calls a character wounded by this person and provokes her to talk him into it. That is a novel approach the protagonist's vengeful turning point, and it elicits subliminal moral uncertainty that the audience has to take in hand.8mm is a conventional studio thriller, but it is a real movie. It is all content and the suitable approach to that content. It is about human's aptitude for malevolence, conjecturing just deep it can go and how little we care to know of it in ourselves.

"8mm" sucks you in from the moment you watch the snuff film with Nicholas Cage, not letting you go until the very end, where it spits you out encased in a cocoon of bloody phlegm.The director successfully creates a gritty atmosphere that remains constant right up until the end, but the plot isn't so lucky. As others have pointed out, things get ridiculous towards the films finale, which if crafted with more tact could have made "8mm" a great film rather than simply an entertaining one.Cage gives a good, rather sombre performance as the private investigator hired to determine the authenticity of a snuff film found in the late husband of a senator's safe. From there on he's plopped into the festering world of deviant pornography, forced to explore the seedy bowels of stomach-churningly filthy underground sexual practices. Amy Morton's performance as Mary Ann's mother is perfect, conveying the emotions of a distraught, depressed mother beautifully. Joaquin Pheonix steals the show as the charismatic owner of a sex-shop.Full of suspense, this film should at least entertain you as you watch with disgust and repulsion some of the dirtiest human habits imaginable.7 out of 10.

Any movie with a plot about a wealthy pervert paying one million dollars to pornographers to produce a 1992 snuff movie with a jumpy and grainy hand held 8mm movie camera should be an early warning that this film must be as defective as the cameraman (with obvious advanced Parkinson's disease) who operated the camera while the victim was being killed. The movie had a horror comic book style with its background of Gotham City slums, retro-technology and cartoonish characters. The bad guys have adopted sleeze as a total life style, i.e., they not only have sleezy jobs, they wear sleezy clothes, decorate their offices with junk store discounts, and prefer to live in urban slums. Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a private eye who is able to learn the identity of the snuff film victim with a lot of improbable good luck. He plods through the film with the energy of someone with low blood pressure! The film is neither disturbing or exciting. It is boring and stupid!

The intensely intriguing storyline of 8MM follows the haunting search by a private investigator (played superbly by Nicolas Cage) for the makers of a grotesque and disturbing snuff film in which a young woman is murdered. Starting by looking through endless missing persons files (in an attempt to identify the victim), Cage ultimately follows leads to the world of underground seaze films and the people who are involved in making them. Throughout his creepy investigation, Cage becomes more and more disturbed by the Snuff film and stops at nothing in an attempt to track down answers to what really happened.  This film is So intriguing and suspenseful, there are scenes that will leave your heart pounding in anticipation of what's to come.  I don't know if I have ever seen such an intriguing and suspenseful Drama/Thriller ever before!  This film is so realistic, there are times when you feel as if what is going on is real, and you begin to feel more for the characters than you usually do in a film.  The last 20 minutes of the film are heart pounding and breathtaking!  Director Joel Schumacher delivers one of the most mind haunting dramas you will ever see and gives us a story that won't be easy to forget.  It's dark, moody, creepy, brilliant, and disturbing!  And when all the pieces finally come together, you'll be glad you went along for the ride.  Wow, It's a sick world we live in!!  I give this movie 4 out of 4 stars!

8MM / (1999) ***Starring: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare, Catherine Keener, and Amy Morton Directed by Joel Schumacher. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker. Running time: 123 minutes. Rated R (for strong sexual content, nudity, violence, and for strong language).By Blake French:	Joel Schumacher's new disquieting thriller, "8MM," is the kind of movie that starts out hesitantly calm, but contains an atmosphere where potentially detestable material may become apparent, as if the film is preparing us for something much more bellicose. Sure enough, a half hour into the picture, we take possession of plot points regarding subjects beyond human imagination. Our very effective condition propels us into a sleazy world of hard core adult contents. "8MM" is a tense, dramatic production with tantalizing dialogue and a driving theme of action. There is a scene in the film in which a character explains a relative, although somewhat overlooked, concept. "When you dance with the devil, you don't change the devil--the devil changes you," he declares as he walks down a long, dark ally with another character. 	Nicolas Cage stars as Tom Welles, a highly acclaimed private detective living with his wife Amy (Catherine Keener), and their newborn son in a homey, relaxed country house. As the film opens, he is called upon by the widow of an important political man, Mrs. Mathews (Amy Morton). This elderly woman has discovered the contents of her late husband's secret safe and his extremely concerned about some of them. Most of the objects found in the safe are normal. One in particular, however, a film strip, is not what you would call ordinary, but suspicious and concealed. Mrs. Mathews explains to Tom what he will see on this tape is something of unimaginable terror. Tom views the 8mm tape, watching in horror as  a young girl is raped and brutally beaten to death in front of a camera operator, a silent viewer, and a muscular man wearing all sorts of S&M clothing. The well-developed conflict brought to our attention at this point: Mrs. Matthews is requiring Tom to find out if the tragic events that occur on tape are real or not, and if her husband had anything to do with this atrocity. Welles opens a missing person's case and reports to his wife that he will be away for a few weeks on duty. He first searches through countless files containing young kidnapping victims. The results: a fifteen year old girl named Marianne who ran away from home six years ago with the company of her boyfriend as they were heading towards Hollywood, California. Next, he converses with several key characters including her depressed mother, a scruffy acquaintance, and her so called boyfriend who is now serving time in prison. He claims Marianne ran off to work at a strip club. These characters point Tom in the direction of an underworld of "snuff" movies, where he meets an adult book store clerk named Max California (Joaquin Phoenix). He and Max become friends. After some negotiating, our fellow porn genius agrees to share his knowledge with Tom and lead him to the makers of the 8mm snuff film. There we meet Eddie Poole, a perverted photographer, (James Gandolfini), Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), a disquieted man who believes smut to be a form of art, and The Machine, the man in the S&M mask who murdered Marianne in the video Mrs. Mathews found. "8MM" has an excellently developed setup. A setup that indicates us on the snuff film, as well as the setting, character motives, personalities, dramatic premise, and plot points. The only component that is missing is the history and or in depth elaboration on Tom Welles. With such an important character, one who drives the entire narrative through line, we need to feel a lot of empathy so that we may root for him. Unfortunately, the filmmakers present the audience with only the minimum introduction. The side characters are also descriptive. In their own presence, contribute to both the story and atmosphere. Director Joel Schumacher's work has always been some of my favorite. With movies like "Falling Down," "Flawless," and "Batman & Robin," I was never expecting him to construct a dark, grim, film such as "8MM." This feature is tasteless and nasty, repulsive and unsettling--while all these bases are relentless within the context of the plot. No doubt many audiences will be offended throughout, perhaps even to the point of where they walk out of the theater. This is a production on the verge of an NC-17 rating and is adult in every atom of its being. The perverse and gritty character motives and mature subject matters all fitted appropriately here, but the film still goes over the top in many areas. Some of the movie's characters are a bit too obvious. The villain, for instance, I could predict from the first five minutes he is on screen. Whenever there is a character who seems to have no cause or purpose in the plot, he is normally the bad guy. Here, although the character twists are effective and the casting is brilliant, we receive several clinches that many views will be able to detect immediately.Nicolas Cage is obviously  the right choice for Tom Welles, a man who is more submissive than brutal, but is placed in a situation where deep down he desires bloodshed, but knows his morals challenge him otherwise. "8MM" is a movie that frolics with this character's emotions and values, and at the same time lives up to a premise that is way out of his league.

Private eye Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) has a regular family life with his wife (Catherine Keener) and a baby. Daniel Longdale (Anthony Heald) is a lawyer of recently widowed Mrs. Christian. She found a shocking snuff film in her husband's possessions and she wants Welles to check its authenticity. He is hired to find the missing girl. He finds a missing report for Mary Ann Mathews which leads to California. He enlists the help of porn store clerk musician Max (Joaquin Phoenix). The trail leads to pornographer Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) and then Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare).I really like the moody feel at the start but the L.A. stuff is borderline silly. Some of the investigation is a bit too old school. I get a sense that director Joel Schumacher is trying to hard-boiled this thriller more than necessary as a style choice. Nicolas Cage is able to keep this train on track with his intensity. Phoenix adds a good dash of color. This movie is like one of those serial killer movies. It is both disturbing and compelling.

This is a quite chilling film with a tendency to go a little over the top at times. Nicholas Cage is characteristically ghost-like in his portrayal of a man sucked into the world of fetishistic porn. On the whole it works as an intriguing thriller but not as an education in this subspeciality of sexual deviance.

Eight millimeter is a gritty and disturbing look into the world of underground illegal pornography with a wonderful performance from the supporting cast including James Gandolfini(the sopranos) who play's a sleazy porn star agent, and Peter Stormare(Fargo) a twisted pornographer with the delusion of artistic genius. the film to say the least is fantastic but certainly not for the easily offended or faint hearted. starting with the discovery of a snuff film in a deceased business mans secret safe, a private investigator portrayed by Nicholas Cage(Raising Arizona)goes on a physically and emotionally draining journey to find out the authenticity of the film and who was involved in its production definitely a film that has to be seen to be truly appreciated i suggest not watching it to late at night. i give this film a definite 8.5 out of ten.Gritty, Disturbing and fantastic, definitely take a shower after watching this.

Despite a lack of concrete evidence to support its existence, the snuff movie has endured for decades as an urban legend simply because the idea is so perversely intriguing and downright plausible; surely someone, somewhere has been murdered on film purely for the purpose of entertainment. This is the central theme of Joel Schumacher's 8MM, a thrilling descent into the grimy world of extreme pornography which sees Nicolas Cage as private detective Tom Welles, who is hired by a wealthy widow to find out whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe is really what it appears to be—a snuff movie!Cage gives one of the best performances of his career as a man forced to confront pure evil as he submerses himself in a world of fetish, porn and violence, and discovers precisely what a sick and disturbing place the world can be. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker of SE7EN fame, this is unrelentingly grim stuff made all the more provoking by its gritty sense of realism, the classy direction from Schumacher, and the excellent supporting cast, which includes standout turns from James Gandolfini as porn casting agent Eddie Poole, Joaquin Phoenix as sex-shop cashier Max California, and Peter Stormare as deviant director Dino Velvet.

This film is quite a let down.  Its depiction of the S&M scene is nothing other than cliche.  It appears that the script may have had some potential. However, the film makers chose the easy way out and kept everything on the predictable level.  The characters are all flat flavorless bores. Especially Cage's.  It's a prime example of one dimensionality.  The film takes no risks, although the marketing will have you thinking the movie delves deep into the dark side of the human psyche.  In reality, it's nothing more than a waste of 2 1/2 hours.The best part for me was during the big climactic scene as Cage is creeping in the big bad evil guy's house, the projector died and the lights came on. Best laugh in the whole movie...

In the list of my 10 preferred films 8MM occupies the fifth place. This film is simply perfect. To begin the music is excellent, it contributes to give an at the same time sad, strange and beautiful particular environment. Then the actors whose initially Nicolas Cage are all very talented, especially Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfini. The scenario writer Andrew Kevin Walker who had largely proved reliable with Se7en did an extraordinary work. But what I enjoyed me the most in this film it is that there is a morals. In its investigation Nicolas Cage tests each minute more and more compassion for the wildly assassinated young girl whom it ends up making the decision not only to find all the authors of the snuff but of all to kill them.That's what I call a hero. This film is not on violence or sadomasochism but on the punishment. If in the true life each time that a snuff is carried out all passed as in 8MM,it would be a large thing.For me it is the best film of Schumacher which is at all events one of the largest realizers of the world. 10/10

I want to make this clear: overall, I thought this was a good movie.  Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a private investigator hired to find the victim of what appears to be a snuff film, found by a widow after her rich husband's demise.  In order to track it down he has to make his way into the deep world of violent and horrific porn.You really have to know what you're getting into.  It's the same thing with any movie that's disturbing - if you get taken by surprise you can have a really unpleasant experience.  Se7en was like that.  Schindler's List was like that.  Closetland (a much more obscure movie) was also like that.  But if you don't mind, or you're ready for it, you can get through it much more easily.The climactic scenes are worth the wait.  Cage becomes vengeance incarnate, and the dialogue is gripping.By now you're probably wondering about that "boring" part from the summary. Okay.  I can't stand when a movie tries to take the easy way out of anything, especially something as important as character development. Catherine Keener plays Amy Welles, Tom's wife.  Tom also has a baby.  This movie was LONG.  This movie had a lot of plot to get through, and the wife and baby were there purely to make it look like Tom cared about his family. He didn't.  They never have any effect on him, you never expect him to sacrifice anything of his work for them, and he doesn't.  The movie would've been far better if they just hadn't been there to weight the plot down with pointlessness.  It's like they didn't trust Nicholas Cage to be a good enough actor to portray being a good person.  He did that fine, generally. In his scenes with Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) he shows great empathy and compassion.It bothered me a lot.  It bothered my girlfriend even more, and so she *didn't* like watching this movie.  But all in all I'd still have to give it a thumbs-up.  I just wish they'd trimmed the fat a bit.

Disturbing images; but empty of substance. Promising gritty realism, this film delivers visually, but fails colossally to achieve any plot points. The audience is submerged into a dark detestable world, but this world ultimately becomes simply another angle on the traditional horror formula. But worse: IT NEVER TRIES TO DELVE INTO ITS VILLAINS. SPOILER- Why do these guys do those things? Cuz they're BAD. Literally no time is spent developing the bad guys; they're just scum. I'm not saying I wanted to care about them, but how about casting some light on these important (pseudo)characters? Even remotely?I expected more. "Silence of the Lambs," "Seven": these movies bring you into the minds of monsters. That's why they're important and unforgettable.8mm had the potential to mimic true horror but wasted it by going the easy route of manipulative shock-value drama. What a disappointment.

8MM is a very dark, disturbing film that isn't for everyone. Nicolas Cage puts in an excellent performance as a private detective named Tom Welles who is hired to investigate whether a snuff film is real or acted.  His journey takes him farther and farther into the realm of pornography. Every minute of this film is suspenseful and riveting.  I also found Joaquin Phoenix's performance to be outstanding as well.  This movie does a wonderful job of creating a dark mood and exploring the motives and drives behind its characters.  One of Cage's best, and a severely under-rated film.

Firstly, this film is hugely under-rated. For those reviewers who call this film a "waste of time" or place it in the "hall of shame", maybe they should go back to watching more obvious and simple films. 8mm focuses on "snuff" movies and follows Nicholas Cage as he ventures into the dark underworld of the pornographic industry. I'm not a great fan of Nicholas Cage (I still wonder how he ever made it as a movie star), but in 8mm felt he redeemed himself from past performances. Other actors in the film put on great performances, notably Joaquin Pheonix, and James Gandolfini (of Sopranos).What makes the film worth watching though is the emotion, dark imagery and tense moments throughout the film. The storyline too is very well thought out although does have a few holes and untouched areas that may have helped develop the film further. There is no Hollywood ending, forced propaganda, or marketing. What you do get is graphic scenes, moderate violence, and an insight into "snuff" movies (which really is quite disturbing).Having said that this movie is not for the faint hearted, so if you're a "puppy-dogs and ice-cream" kind of person I'd suggest watching something else. If however, you feel you will be able to stomach such a film then prepare yourself for a moving film, which will leave you feeling that little bit darker at the end.I highly recommend this film. 8/10

When I watched 8 MM, I didn't know what to expect, but I noticed that Joel Schumacher directed it and I am a fan of his. Also it stars two other terrific actors like Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, so usually that equals a great film. 8 MM turned out to be a terrific dark drama that I'm not so sure that I understand it's low rating. I was actually expecting it to be in the 7.0 range when I went to check it out on IMDb, but it's in the low 6.0's. I understand that it's an extremely dark movie that not too many people would wanna take a look at, but for what it was, I thought it was great. It took us into the deep dark world of porn and what some sick people get off on. It's not just about that, but also it takes us into a detective type of drama that makes it into a scary type of thriller.Tom Welles is a detective that is given a strange short movie called a "snuff film", where a beautiful young girl is being brutally raped and then murdered on film. While it's supposed to be fake, it looks incredibly real and terrifying. Her relative asks him to find out wither it is fake or real and if she's still alive. This means he has to go deep into a world of brutal porn that is out of his league. With the help of a porn salesman, Max, they go to find out if this girl is really alive or not, but end up getting into some serious trouble when the directors and "actors" find out about them.8 MM is in no way for the faint of heart, there are some extremely disturbing images that I really wouldn't like to see again, I'm sure most wouldn't either, but this is a great dark drama that I would recommend for a watch. Nicholas did a great job, but Joaquin really takes the show here. He made his character incredibly believable and almost sympathetic. Joel really made me believe the story, he shot it wonderfully and didn't over do anything. I would recommend this film for a watch, it's a great thriller that is impressive as well as scary.8/10

I walked into the movie theater last Friday not expecting at all what I was about to see. I'd heard about it, thought "Oh, another Seven". Same screenwriter, but I was way off track. I can stomach a lot, having no problem stuffing down popcorn during very graphic scenes. In 8MM, my coke had trouble going down. 8MM did not have consistent gory/violent scenes, but the way the movie was made made you fill in the blanks of what the makers of the movie could not screen. And if you pay attention and immerse yourself, you fill in more blanks than you really think you could, or want. As Max put it: "the devil changes you." The perversity and deep rottenness of the human minds displayed in 8MM is what disturbs you. Then you realize, that "snuff"-movies are real, that there are individuals twisted enough to endorse/enjoy/take part in it. And worst of all, that these individuals don't look like monsters, they're perhaps just overweight nearsighted men who look like your dad, your son, your brother, even yourself. And if you don't look out,(no matter how secluded you think you are in your suburban home, with a wife, a daughter, and a dog named Shep) you dive into the pit of perversion and rottenness as well, finding no way out. In conclusion: excellent music, acting very sufficient, the plot: a must see. Just don't bring popcorn, and prepare to walk out of the movie theatre disturbed, asking questions, and a little bit more suspicious of those walking around you, and yourself.

Every time I think of Joel Schumacher I cringe. Is Batman & Robin really so bad that it makes me want to disregard the rest of his films? He's not a bad director, hell I enjoy some of his work, yet I still cringe when I hear his name. Let's take a look at 8MM, something that is the polar opposite of B&R.It stars Nic Cage as a private investigator, hired to find out if the content on an 8MM tape found in a safe of a recently deceased millionaire is real. The tape is referred to as a snuff film, which is a pornographic film that ends with the murder of the female. So, already we have ourselves a pretty dark and disturbing film here. Yet, as I watched it I felt that is played it a little too safe.Upon research you will find out the writer and the director had a falling out over the film. The studio wanted it to be a bit lighter, and the director agreed. While the writer, who also wrote Se7en, wanted to keep the gritty disturbing feel he had originally wrote. The final product is a film that tries to be more hardcore then it actually is.Nic Cage really seemed to be playing by the numbers here. He is more monotone then usual I thought and didn't really seem invested in his character. Joaquin Phoenix on the other hand immerses himself into this world. Playing the sidekick who is smarter then he looks. The supporting cast also includes James Gandolfini, doing what he does best and Peter Stormare. Both stretch out beyond the page and embody their characters. With Gandolfini, we've seen him do this character before. But with every performance there is just one little thing that makes them all seem different every time.I was really underwhelmed with this flick. It was a bit longer then it needed to be, just over 2 hours. You go along for the investigative ride and are interested with the story, but at the end you just feel empty. Never connecting with the relationship between the main character and his wife he neglects. Some scenes that were meant to be powerful came off as comedic to me, specifically the "Give me permission to hurt them" bit near the end.I did enjoy the film, but wanted more. The ingredients were there to make a really good film, but the final product falls a bit flat. It's a rental, or if you are really a big fan of anyone involved . I will say this though, I wouldn't mind if Cage went back to making movies like this instead of the filler he's been cranking out the last few years.

Some sensitive-minded people may surely be disturbed by the dark revenge and self-justice in this film, but "Se7en"-author Andrew Kevin Walker has done another fine work with his script! Although the storyline is obviously taken from Paul Schrader´s "Hardcore" (1974,?) the film is suspense-packed, violent and endowed with good performances of its actors, especially Peter Stormare did a brilliant job with playing the weird bondage-porn director Dino Velvet! I also was truly surprised how good director Joel Schumacher had created a morbid atmosphere, just in unhappy memory of his disastrous "Batman & Robin"-flick..! Another pleasant fact is, that "8MM" doesn´t deal with the Hollywood-typical stereotypes and clichés, so finally we´ve got something we could really call a dirty mainstream production - or at least a nice try of it!

Wow, this is a tough subject but not as sordid a film as I figured it would be, although be warned the last 30 minutes are really rough in spots. Speaking of spots, this is a bloody movie in spots, too and very profane after the first 40 minutes. Yet, despite the unpleasant nature of the story (making a "snuff film" - filming the killing of people) it's a riveting one, well-acted and doesn't overdo the violence. The characters in here are some of the most despicable you could find - killer and porn kings.Even our hero here, played by Nicholas Cage, starts off as a clean-cut fairly straight dude, and changes for the worst, too. Joaquin Phoenix has a good line in here, with the prophetic statement, "The devil doesn't change; he changes you."James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare play characters about as bad you'll ever find in a movie. This film is not, as they say, for all tastes. It will turn off a lot of people but it is interesting and good revenge story, if you like that sort of thing and know what you're in for before watching this.

When it came out, "8mm" became notorious for its dark and perverted subject matter. Any and all warnings that are given in association with this film are warranted: this is a dark, dark, thriller, and one that revels in a lot of sordid subject matter. How this was never threatened with an NC-17 is beyond me.Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a well-respected private detective. One day, he gets a call from a recently widowed, and exceedingly wealthy woman named Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter). It seems that when Mrs. Christian was going through her husbands things, she came across a film reel that appears to be a "snuff film" (a "snuff film is where someone is actually murdered on screen, not merely acting like it). Tom is hired to find out if the film is actually real.Andrew Kevin Walker wrote the suspense hit "Seven," and the two films bear a number of similarities. Both deal with grisly and bizarre subject matter, and take no prisoners when they show it all. But "Seven" had something that "8mm" doesn't: a sense of atmosphere. Try as he might, director Joel Schumaker can't establish an ominous atmosphere, which mutes the film's impact.The acting varies. Nicholas Cage is effective as Tom Welles, though that's to be expected because this is a role that Cage could play in his sleep. Joaquin Phoenix shines as Max California, the porn star clerk who becomes Tom's sidekick. The rest of the cast is not so great. James Gandolfini is okay as Eddie Poole, but Peter Stormare (Dino Velvet, a mysterious hard-core porn producer), Anthony Heald as Mrs. Christian's lawyer, Daniel Longdale, (looking strikingly similar to Geraldo Rivera) and Catherine Keener (Tom's neurotic wife)are awful."8mm" works, but it's not masterpiece. The story is easy to follow, as long as you don't stop to think about how the film gets from one scene to the next. But the final 20 minutes are bad; they're not credible, and everyone acts like they've lost their brains."Seven" contained an ingenious twist ending, and while "8mm" doesn't offer that, it takes a few unexpected turns, and the story is not formulaic.This is a good film, but not a great one. Recommended, if you can get it for cheap.

I'll never forget first seeing this film in the theater.  When I heard that this film was written by the same writer as "Seven", I expected a truly sick and twisted film.  Now don't get me wrong, this most certainly is a sick and twisted film, but it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected.  Maybe that is due to this film having a different director, but nonetheless the film wasn't as graphic as I'd expected.  With that said, and having watched this film a number of times, I still wouldn't recommend this film to everyone. If you like thrillers and can handle the subject of pornography and "snuff" films, then you should definitely give this film a chance.I'm a little surprised that this film has such a low rating on IMDB.  I can see why someone wouldn't like it, but I can't see why it would have such a low rating.  I would assume that most viewers couldn't handle the subject and therefore gave the film a low rating.All of the actors involved in this film did a very good job.  Nicholas Cage was great as always (sometimes a little over-acting, but most of the time he was great).  James Gandolfini, Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Storemare, Anthony Heald, Catherine Keener, and the rest of the supporting cast all pulled off solid performances.Joel Schumacher really needs to stick with films like this.  He really does a great job with thriller/drama type films (and needs to steer clear of certain super-hero films).  Joel did a great job with this film and I look forward to his next work.The only complaint I have about the film is the music.  There were some times were the music was perfect or tolerable, but there were others where it was just horrible and detracted from the film.  Some of the music in the film was too bizarre and didn't fit with the film.Like I said, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I thought this was an excellent film.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris

This movie deserves higher than a 6.5/10.This is a very dark and disturbing movie. Along the lines of Se7en. This honestly makes a good companion piece to it. This is the dark underbelly of the world. This is evil.The movie keeps you invested throughout.The soundtrack is very unusual at parts and doesn't go with the movie at all.Sidenote: has James Gandolfini ever not played a scumbag?

"8MM" starts off strong but implodes at the end, unfortunately defeating the credit most of the film offers.Nicholas Cage plays Tom Welles, a Private Investigator hired by the widow of an industrial magnate (Myra Carter) and her lawyer (Anthony Heald) to examine if a "snuff" film found in her late husband's safe is real. The snuff is terrifying; it features a man in a leather mask stabbing a young teen (Jenny Powell), who has been reported missing. In order to discover the truth, Welles must enlist aid from Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), a porn store clerk, as they travel through the depths of human perversion and encounter villains in the "alternative" porn industry, including Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini), and Machine (Christopher Bauer), a twisted S&M fetish killer.Max California is by far the most interesting character in "8MM." Both the script and Phoenix's acting allow the audience to peer into the mind of the smut store worker, whom we sympathize with because he is good comic relief and a lonely type, working in this wasteland only to support his unsuccessful music career. Max delivers some lines expressing how the pornography industry lured him into this hell and how it is impossible to escape. In fact, Max upstages Cage's detective Welles, who is possibly the most boring person in the film. The script provides no back-story or personality for our protagonist, nor any insights into his mind. Welles's only redemption is Cage's able acting.Another great role is that of Machine, a psycho who wears a crude leather mask. Before we learn anything about Machine, he makes a fascinating maniac. Is he an evil freak with a mental illness? Is he a seemingly everyday man with a split personality? Either way, Machine is an ominous monster. Then, the screenplay goes so far as to ruin our intrigue. Rather than leave his identity to the imagination, we actually get to see Machine for who he really is. In an anti-climatic fight for life, the haunting mask is removed, accompanied with cartoonish, moronic dialogue that was intended to be witty. The revelation of Machine for who he really was is intended to be ironic and surprising, but this cliched scene was so not clever that I felt a surge of disappointment and anger at how "8MM" had degraded since it began. "8MM" mainly succeeds at presenting a disturbing, sickening tour through the corrupted minds of pornography addicts. Welles and Max actually go to a secret subterranean dungeon where illegal porn trade is dealt. Stunning and horrifying are two adjectives that describe this culture of filth. Almost every type of sex is produced and purchased here: bestiality, child porn, mutilation, fake and gory snuff, hermaphrodites, brutal S&M, etc. In one scene, several men masturbate to a female doctor, breasts exposed, stabbing a man in the buttocks with a syringe. A blow to one's mind and stomach are packaged into this film. It's overwhelming to realize that in the chasms of civilized human society, there are a few vile minds who resort to this abhorrent "entertainment" for pleasure.However, all of this powerful terror collapses in the last 45 minutes. All the villains come together against Welles in an over-the-top, half-witted battle with lame, corny gothic overtones. Everyone hugely overacts this scene, most noticeably Peter Stormare's Dino Velvet who has some cheesy lines to deliver ("Kill them, Machine! Kill them all!). Also, one person's appearance as an adversary is not the least bit shocking. In fact, the first time this character was introduced I said to myself, "He's a bad guy." This big rendezvous, no matter how poorly executed, should have ended the film. Instead, Welles runs away to his house rather than killing the unarmed bad guys. When the screenplay finally calls upon our protagonist to wrap up the movie, your interest has already faltered because the film should have ended 20 minutes ago. There's once scene when Welles has a killer tied up. The good guy has a gun, the bad guy is helpless. During this episode, the killer incessantly and obnoxiously explodes into outbursts of bloodthirsty insults about his killing of an innocent. Welles is being tortured by the taunts, but he doesn't shoot the murderer. What he does is runs to his car and moans. This is a perfect example of painfully stupid false endings "8MM" offers.Eventually, the phony conclusions, over-acting, naïve showdowns, predictability, and boring personas bring "8MM" down.

There is a lot to be said about skill. Joel Schumacher is responsible for Batman & Robin, one of the most horrendously made movies in the past 15 years. One could have said upon leaving the theater in 1997 that Joel Schumacher is one of the worst directors working today. Two years later, Schumacher creates something, albeit with commercial sensibilities, that succeeds on many levels. 8mm is a murky, scuzzy passage through the miserable, dystopian criminal world of snuff films, taken on by a private investigator who is dismayed and scarred by what he unearths. It probes the resources of violent exploitation films, but not as a violent exploitation film. It would more accurately turn your stomach than amuse. Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote Seven, and again establishes a protagonist who confronts evil and nearly loses his sanity in an effort to understand its reasons. The answer comes almost at the end of the film, from its most vicious character, but his rationale wittingly refrains from going as deep as the psychological world of his deeds. Joel Schumacher has an attraction to sinister, perhaps Gothic environments, even if his previous films that follow that pattern aren't so great, like The Lost Boys. Here, with Mychael Danna's sorrowful score and the great Robert Elswit's guilty, peeping camera, he fashions an impression of apprehension even in the few scenes where the story takes solace in Cage's home life. One director would not be wrong to shock us with a comparison to the unsuspecting atmosphere of Cage's residential street or the opening airport shot, but Schumacher perceives the looming subterranean goings-on beneath the unsuspecting.The intent of the story is to consider a rather everyday individual and provoke him into such a troubling conflict with pure evil that he himself is pushed to torture and murder. He lives an unexciting but mostly happy life with his wife Catherine Keener and their infant daughter. He went to a good school on an academic scholarship, however while his contemporaries went through the most conventional motions to become lawyers, doctors, bankers, he chose a line of work comprised of following, shadowing, investigating, staking out, watching. For the sake of a comfortable living, he accommodates an upper crust circle of socialites and politicians. Nevertheless, this case which he almost does not take is unique. He is sent for by the attorney of a rich widow whose husband has just died. Whilst rummaging through the inside of her husband's safe, she and the lawyer find an 8 mm film of what seems to be the vicious slaying of a teenage girl by a large masked man. Cage convinces himself that the film, while horrifying, is simulation, but the widow wants him to confirm this for sure.8mm doesn't consider the story's dilemmas merely as opportunity for money-making set pieces like action scenes. When Cage has the chance to take revenge, he doesn't have the command of his motivation because he does not have the same capacity for murder that his prospective victims have, and he essentially calls a character wounded by this person and provokes her to talk him into it. That is a novel approach the protagonist's vengeful turning point, and it elicits subliminal moral uncertainty that the audience has to take in hand.8mm is a conventional studio thriller, but it is a real movie. It is all content and the suitable approach to that content. It is about human's aptitude for malevolence, conjecturing just deep it can go and how little we care to know of it in ourselves.

"8mm" sucks you in from the moment you watch the snuff film with Nicholas Cage, not letting you go until the very end, where it spits you out encased in a cocoon of bloody phlegm.The director successfully creates a gritty atmosphere that remains constant right up until the end, but the plot isn't so lucky. As others have pointed out, things get ridiculous towards the films finale, which if crafted with more tact could have made "8mm" a great film rather than simply an entertaining one.Cage gives a good, rather sombre performance as the private investigator hired to determine the authenticity of a snuff film found in the late husband of a senator's safe. From there on he's plopped into the festering world of deviant pornography, forced to explore the seedy bowels of stomach-churningly filthy underground sexual practices. Amy Morton's performance as Mary Ann's mother is perfect, conveying the emotions of a distraught, depressed mother beautifully. Joaquin Pheonix steals the show as the charismatic owner of a sex-shop.Full of suspense, this film should at least entertain you as you watch with disgust and repulsion some of the dirtiest human habits imaginable.7 out of 10.

Any movie with a plot about a wealthy pervert paying one million dollars to pornographers to produce a 1992 snuff movie with a jumpy and grainy hand held 8mm movie camera should be an early warning that this film must be as defective as the cameraman (with obvious advanced Parkinson's disease) who operated the camera while the victim was being killed. The movie had a horror comic book style with its background of Gotham City slums, retro-technology and cartoonish characters. The bad guys have adopted sleeze as a total life style, i.e., they not only have sleezy jobs, they wear sleezy clothes, decorate their offices with junk store discounts, and prefer to live in urban slums. Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a private eye who is able to learn the identity of the snuff film victim with a lot of improbable good luck. He plods through the film with the energy of someone with low blood pressure! The film is neither disturbing or exciting. It is boring and stupid!

The intensely intriguing storyline of 8MM follows the haunting search by a private investigator (played superbly by Nicolas Cage) for the makers of a grotesque and disturbing snuff film in which a young woman is murdered. Starting by looking through endless missing persons files (in an attempt to identify the victim), Cage ultimately follows leads to the world of underground seaze films and the people who are involved in making them. Throughout his creepy investigation, Cage becomes more and more disturbed by the Snuff film and stops at nothing in an attempt to track down answers to what really happened.  This film is So intriguing and suspenseful, there are scenes that will leave your heart pounding in anticipation of what's to come.  I don't know if I have ever seen such an intriguing and suspenseful Drama/Thriller ever before!  This film is so realistic, there are times when you feel as if what is going on is real, and you begin to feel more for the characters than you usually do in a film.  The last 20 minutes of the film are heart pounding and breathtaking!  Director Joel Schumacher delivers one of the most mind haunting dramas you will ever see and gives us a story that won't be easy to forget.  It's dark, moody, creepy, brilliant, and disturbing!  And when all the pieces finally come together, you'll be glad you went along for the ride.  Wow, It's a sick world we live in!!  I give this movie 4 out of 4 stars!

8MM / (1999) ***Starring: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare, Catherine Keener, and Amy Morton Directed by Joel Schumacher. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker. Running time: 123 minutes. Rated R (for strong sexual content, nudity, violence, and for strong language).By Blake French:	Joel Schumacher's new disquieting thriller, "8MM," is the kind of movie that starts out hesitantly calm, but contains an atmosphere where potentially detestable material may become apparent, as if the film is preparing us for something much more bellicose. Sure enough, a half hour into the picture, we take possession of plot points regarding subjects beyond human imagination. Our very effective condition propels us into a sleazy world of hard core adult contents. "8MM" is a tense, dramatic production with tantalizing dialogue and a driving theme of action. There is a scene in the film in which a character explains a relative, although somewhat overlooked, concept. "When you dance with the devil, you don't change the devil--the devil changes you," he declares as he walks down a long, dark ally with another character. 	Nicolas Cage stars as Tom Welles, a highly acclaimed private detective living with his wife Amy (Catherine Keener), and their newborn son in a homey, relaxed country house. As the film opens, he is called upon by the widow of an important political man, Mrs. Mathews (Amy Morton). This elderly woman has discovered the contents of her late husband's secret safe and his extremely concerned about some of them. Most of the objects found in the safe are normal. One in particular, however, a film strip, is not what you would call ordinary, but suspicious and concealed. Mrs. Mathews explains to Tom what he will see on this tape is something of unimaginable terror. Tom views the 8mm tape, watching in horror as  a young girl is raped and brutally beaten to death in front of a camera operator, a silent viewer, and a muscular man wearing all sorts of S&M clothing. The well-developed conflict brought to our attention at this point: Mrs. Matthews is requiring Tom to find out if the tragic events that occur on tape are real or not, and if her husband had anything to do with this atrocity. Welles opens a missing person's case and reports to his wife that he will be away for a few weeks on duty. He first searches through countless files containing young kidnapping victims. The results: a fifteen year old girl named Marianne who ran away from home six years ago with the company of her boyfriend as they were heading towards Hollywood, California. Next, he converses with several key characters including her depressed mother, a scruffy acquaintance, and her so called boyfriend who is now serving time in prison. He claims Marianne ran off to work at a strip club. These characters point Tom in the direction of an underworld of "snuff" movies, where he meets an adult book store clerk named Max California (Joaquin Phoenix). He and Max become friends. After some negotiating, our fellow porn genius agrees to share his knowledge with Tom and lead him to the makers of the 8mm snuff film. There we meet Eddie Poole, a perverted photographer, (James Gandolfini), Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), a disquieted man who believes smut to be a form of art, and The Machine, the man in the S&M mask who murdered Marianne in the video Mrs. Mathews found. "8MM" has an excellently developed setup. A setup that indicates us on the snuff film, as well as the setting, character motives, personalities, dramatic premise, and plot points. The only component that is missing is the history and or in depth elaboration on Tom Welles. With such an important character, one who drives the entire narrative through line, we need to feel a lot of empathy so that we may root for him. Unfortunately, the filmmakers present the audience with only the minimum introduction. The side characters are also descriptive. In their own presence, contribute to both the story and atmosphere. Director Joel Schumacher's work has always been some of my favorite. With movies like "Falling Down," "Flawless," and "Batman & Robin," I was never expecting him to construct a dark, grim, film such as "8MM." This feature is tasteless and nasty, repulsive and unsettling--while all these bases are relentless within the context of the plot. No doubt many audiences will be offended throughout, perhaps even to the point of where they walk out of the theater. This is a production on the verge of an NC-17 rating and is adult in every atom of its being. The perverse and gritty character motives and mature subject matters all fitted appropriately here, but the film still goes over the top in many areas. Some of the movie's characters are a bit too obvious. The villain, for instance, I could predict from the first five minutes he is on screen. Whenever there is a character who seems to have no cause or purpose in the plot, he is normally the bad guy. Here, although the character twists are effective and the casting is brilliant, we receive several clinches that many views will be able to detect immediately.Nicolas Cage is obviously  the right choice for Tom Welles, a man who is more submissive than brutal, but is placed in a situation where deep down he desires bloodshed, but knows his morals challenge him otherwise. "8MM" is a movie that frolics with this character's emotions and values, and at the same time lives up to a premise that is way out of his league.

This is a quite chilling film with a tendency to go a little over the top at times. Nicholas Cage is characteristically ghost-like in his portrayal of a man sucked into the world of fetishistic porn. On the whole it works as an intriguing thriller but not as an education in this subspeciality of sexual deviance.

Private eye Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) has a regular family life with his wife (Catherine Keener) and a baby. Daniel Longdale (Anthony Heald) is a lawyer of recently widowed Mrs. Christian. She found a shocking snuff film in her husband's possessions and she wants Welles to check its authenticity. He is hired to find the missing girl. He finds a missing report for Mary Ann Mathews which leads to California. He enlists the help of porn store clerk musician Max (Joaquin Phoenix). The trail leads to pornographer Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) and then Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare).I really like the moody feel at the start but the L.A. stuff is borderline silly. Some of the investigation is a bit too old school. I get a sense that director Joel Schumacher is trying to hard-boiled this thriller more than necessary as a style choice. Nicolas Cage is able to keep this train on track with his intensity. Phoenix adds a good dash of color. This movie is like one of those serial killer movies. It is both disturbing and compelling.

Eight millimeter is a gritty and disturbing look into the world of underground illegal pornography with a wonderful performance from the supporting cast including James Gandolfini(the sopranos) who play's a sleazy porn star agent, and Peter Stormare(Fargo) a twisted pornographer with the delusion of artistic genius. the film to say the least is fantastic but certainly not for the easily offended or faint hearted. starting with the discovery of a snuff film in a deceased business mans secret safe, a private investigator portrayed by Nicholas Cage(Raising Arizona)goes on a physically and emotionally draining journey to find out the authenticity of the film and who was involved in its production definitely a film that has to be seen to be truly appreciated i suggest not watching it to late at night. i give this film a definite 8.5 out of ten.Gritty, Disturbing and fantastic, definitely take a shower after watching this.

Despite a lack of concrete evidence to support its existence, the snuff movie has endured for decades as an urban legend simply because the idea is so perversely intriguing and downright plausible; surely someone, somewhere has been murdered on film purely for the purpose of entertainment. This is the central theme of Joel Schumacher's 8MM, a thrilling descent into the grimy world of extreme pornography which sees Nicolas Cage as private detective Tom Welles, who is hired by a wealthy widow to find out whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe is really what it appears to be—a snuff movie!Cage gives one of the best performances of his career as a man forced to confront pure evil as he submerses himself in a world of fetish, porn and violence, and discovers precisely what a sick and disturbing place the world can be. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker of SE7EN fame, this is unrelentingly grim stuff made all the more provoking by its gritty sense of realism, the classy direction from Schumacher, and the excellent supporting cast, which includes standout turns from James Gandolfini as porn casting agent Eddie Poole, Joaquin Phoenix as sex-shop cashier Max California, and Peter Stormare as deviant director Dino Velvet.

This film is quite a let down.  Its depiction of the S&M scene is nothing other than cliche.  It appears that the script may have had some potential. However, the film makers chose the easy way out and kept everything on the predictable level.  The characters are all flat flavorless bores. Especially Cage's.  It's a prime example of one dimensionality.  The film takes no risks, although the marketing will have you thinking the movie delves deep into the dark side of the human psyche.  In reality, it's nothing more than a waste of 2 1/2 hours.The best part for me was during the big climactic scene as Cage is creeping in the big bad evil guy's house, the projector died and the lights came on. Best laugh in the whole movie...

In the list of my 10 preferred films 8MM occupies the fifth place. This film is simply perfect. To begin the music is excellent, it contributes to give an at the same time sad, strange and beautiful particular environment. Then the actors whose initially Nicolas Cage are all very talented, especially Joaquin Phoenix and James Gandolfini. The scenario writer Andrew Kevin Walker who had largely proved reliable with Se7en did an extraordinary work. But what I enjoyed me the most in this film it is that there is a morals. In its investigation Nicolas Cage tests each minute more and more compassion for the wildly assassinated young girl whom it ends up making the decision not only to find all the authors of the snuff but of all to kill them.That's what I call a hero. This film is not on violence or sadomasochism but on the punishment. If in the true life each time that a snuff is carried out all passed as in 8MM,it would be a large thing.For me it is the best film of Schumacher which is at all events one of the largest realizers of the world. 10/10

I want to make this clear: overall, I thought this was a good movie.  Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is a private investigator hired to find the victim of what appears to be a snuff film, found by a widow after her rich husband's demise.  In order to track it down he has to make his way into the deep world of violent and horrific porn.You really have to know what you're getting into.  It's the same thing with any movie that's disturbing - if you get taken by surprise you can have a really unpleasant experience.  Se7en was like that.  Schindler's List was like that.  Closetland (a much more obscure movie) was also like that.  But if you don't mind, or you're ready for it, you can get through it much more easily.The climactic scenes are worth the wait.  Cage becomes vengeance incarnate, and the dialogue is gripping.By now you're probably wondering about that "boring" part from the summary. Okay.  I can't stand when a movie tries to take the easy way out of anything, especially something as important as character development. Catherine Keener plays Amy Welles, Tom's wife.  Tom also has a baby.  This movie was LONG.  This movie had a lot of plot to get through, and the wife and baby were there purely to make it look like Tom cared about his family. He didn't.  They never have any effect on him, you never expect him to sacrifice anything of his work for them, and he doesn't.  The movie would've been far better if they just hadn't been there to weight the plot down with pointlessness.  It's like they didn't trust Nicholas Cage to be a good enough actor to portray being a good person.  He did that fine, generally. In his scenes with Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) he shows great empathy and compassion.It bothered me a lot.  It bothered my girlfriend even more, and so she *didn't* like watching this movie.  But all in all I'd still have to give it a thumbs-up.  I just wish they'd trimmed the fat a bit.

Disturbing images; but empty of substance. Promising gritty realism, this film delivers visually, but fails colossally to achieve any plot points. The audience is submerged into a dark detestable world, but this world ultimately becomes simply another angle on the traditional horror formula. But worse: IT NEVER TRIES TO DELVE INTO ITS VILLAINS. SPOILER- Why do these guys do those things? Cuz they're BAD. Literally no time is spent developing the bad guys; they're just scum. I'm not saying I wanted to care about them, but how about casting some light on these important (pseudo)characters? Even remotely?I expected more. "Silence of the Lambs," "Seven": these movies bring you into the minds of monsters. That's why they're important and unforgettable.8mm had the potential to mimic true horror but wasted it by going the easy route of manipulative shock-value drama. What a disappointment.
