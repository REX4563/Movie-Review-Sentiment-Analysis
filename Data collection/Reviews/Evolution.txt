While this film is far from a masterpiece, Evolution deserves better ratings than it currently enjoys here at IMDb. The cast and crew contribute superior work, and the storyline is quite inventive. The premise has been done a few times before, however, it has never been done quite as well as the treatment it receives here.Alien spores land here on Earth and begin to wreak havoc.I found this highly entertaining, cleverly witty, with a slick production quality which tends to draw in the audience, who finds its members laughing, sometimes in spite of themselves. You won't WANT to like this. There is a large amount of juvenile humor, which usually would detract from a work such as this, but this is a sci-fi comedy that WORKS.Again, it's no masterpiece, but it IS clever and fun, in spite of the sophomoric humor.It rates a 7.3/10 from...the Fiend :.

I can't say I suspected much from the previews.  I anticipated another lame comedy and a cheap imitation of "Men in Black."  "Evolution" can be compared to "MIB" in certain aspects, but it breaks new ground.I can't give a really scientific review, because quite frankly I was too busy laughing to weigh out the pros and cons.  This is a great popcorn movie!  (Metaphorically speaking, I was eating nachos) There are scary moments involving slimy creatures, so chances are if there are any females with you--they will be clinging onto your arms.  Ivan Reitman is the famed director of the "Ghostbusters" movies, and "Evolution" has much of the same charm and quirky sense of style and humor. David Duchovny (who really has a good sense of humor off-camera, but happens to get stuck with mostly serious roles) is terrific in a looser role that enables him to flaunt his knack for comedy.  Of course, Orlando Jones is the funniest in the bunch.  He has a terrific scene in which a bug crawls inside his skin and doctors have to get it out...rectally.  I have to say, that was the highlight of this offbeat comedy and had me on the floor!  Julianne Moore plays the clumsy assistant.  I can't say I found her role all that humorous.  Her pratfalls are pretty lame and predictable.  But that minor hint of cheap slapstick didn't ruin the overall experience. 
"Evolution" is great fun from start to finish (a very interesting finish with an innovative product placement)!  Sure, it's all low-brow, but it works and the crude humor is tamed down to a tolerant level (Well, compared to the average contemporary comedy).  This is not a movie to be studied or analyzed or discussed for hours at a time.  Just sit back and HAVE SOME FUN!!!  Because chances are (considering previous 2001 releases) you won't be having this much fun at the movies in quite a while.  I could be wrong, but better to be safe than sorry.My score:  7 (out of 10)

The first thing to say is that this review is written by a non-American. This is to say that a different set of principals are brought to bear on the subject matter. I'm sure that other in the U.S and around the world will(and have)expressed opinions, but this one comes from "a whole other country". Evolution is a very enjoyable film. It has been made in a summer of super event movies, and film/game conversions and I feel stands alone as the only comedy with an original source material (in sci-fi anyway).It is highly enjoyable. If you're paying 5 pounds (or $8.50) you need to find a film that refreshes your sentiments with regards to just what a big "money" film should be. As I sit here smoking a cigarette and drinking a 7up, I figure this film to be a winner. The principals act in a manner appropriate to the subject material, and although Mr. Duchovny is not a comedy actor, I feel he acquits himself admirably in an unfamiliar field. Mr. Jones is a relative newcomer to the cinema, and I reckon that over time he may very well ascend to the the same esteemed level as Eddie Murphy, or his latterday composite (of sorts) Will Smith.The plot is most sound, and although it draws some comparisons to "Ghostbusters" as other critics have noted, it stands alone as Summer 2001's most original comedy event movie. Mr Reitman, a veteran knows how to make films play easily, is one of the few directors who knows how to use good comedy actors. With this in mind, no one is underused, perhaps with the one exception of Mr. Dan Aykroyd, nowadays underrated for some insane reason, but who is extremely talented. It's a shame that Aykroyd's presence as a "big" man is more valued then his acting talent, because he's always a delight to watch.To cut in some sourness, there's not a lot of involvement with the central characters, and you do find yourself watching people being cheated into a state of reaction at the expense of the colourful effects, but that's the way it was made, and we can't change that.In all I would recommend this film to the less morose viewer, as it's cheerful, colourful, and does not require an over-critical view. Watch it, and the hell with the printed criticism - you'll enjoy it.

Let me say this: I was never a fan of Ghostbusters.  I guess I never got in on the bandwagon on that one.  I never found it to be as funny as a lot of people (tons of people actually) found it.  I thought parts of it were cool (like the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man), but most of the movie was too drab for me, for some reason.  Someday I'll write a review of it, but I'm too lazy to do it right now.  Why am I talking about Ghostbusters when I'm reviewing Evolution, some of you ask?  Well, it's simple.  The same man directs both movies (Ivan Reitman) and both movies have very similar plots.  Except that, in my opinion, Evolution is better.  Basically, think of Evolution as a remake of Ghostbusters only throw out the ghosts and put in aliens, which I like because aliens, in my opinion, are cooler and more realistic than ghosts.Let me mention some bad stuff, just to get it over with because I have to do at some point.  This movie misses some serious opportunities to be funny. Sometimes, when you are expecting a joke, there is none.  It's almost as if they really weren't trying.  Sometimes the jokes are a little corny.
One last bad note: some of the aliens suck.  The ending alien is a bit of a let down.  It kind of reminded me of Akira, if you've seen that movie. There is also this cute alien who turns out to be nasty via the "mouth within a mouth", a la Ridley Scott's Alien.Now on to some good stuff.  This movie is really funny in a happy kind of way.  I compare the mood of this movie to another Dreamworks alien-comedy, Galaxy Quest (a movie I thought was hilarious).  If you liked Galaxy Quest, and I think most people did, then you will like Evolution.Something else I would like to point out is how scientific Evolution is. The movie seems very intelligent as far as talking about how the aliens evolve.  I for one and happy to see a movie that isn't completely dumbed down for the uneducated.  I like alien stuff and space stuff, so this kind of science interests me.  Overall, I found Evolution to be very intriguing apart from being funny.Oh, I want to mention Orlando Jones.  He's the black guy from those 7-Up commercials.  I love this guy.  He steals the show in this movie.  I knew the guy was great ever since I saw the first of those 7-Up commercials.  He was also in the Replacements (that lame football comedy which was also somewhat entertaining), and he's probably been in some other stuff I haven't seen or can't remember.  But let me tell you, this guy is going places.  As for the other actors, they're decent.  I like the touch of having David Duchovny on board.  Julian Moore is a good actress, but she got shafted in the character department.  She has a basic "walking cardboard cutout" character with little personality.  Oh well.In conclusion, please do me a favor of not going into this movie expecting a great movie.  Why do people do that?  Every movie can't be the Godfather or 2001 or Saving Private Ryan, so why don't you just shut up and enjoy the movie.  You won't look back at Evolution at the end of the summer as you favorite summer movie this year, but you're not supposed to.  Evolution was made to be entertaining, not great.  It was made to give you your money's worth and put forth an enjoyable show.  I think it accomplishes its mission.7/10

A duo of small town college professors stumble upon a meteor with alien life present. This is great news for them, at least until they find out that the alien evolves and reproduces at a rapid rate, so much that the earth may be devoured in a matter of days.This film's strong point? David Duchovny. While the jokes are so-so and the plot is a pleasant variation of "The Blob", it is Duchovny that makes this film watchable. Without him, it would be easily forgettable and probably wouldn't have the underground geek following that it does. I also appreciated the brief appearance from Sarah Silverman.A few years later, the film "Slither" came out which once again tackles the idea of an evolving, blob-like life form. I think "Slither" is the better film: better effects, much more horror-oriented and still with a healthy dose of comedy. Though I wouldn't say it made "Evolution" entirely obsolete -- they are two distinct films with distinct charms that may appeal to different audiences.

A meteorite hits Earth causing the accelerated evolution of an alien life form.This is a silly comedy with some enjoyable moments.Evolution attempts to cash in on some established formula, such as the spectacle-driven comedy of Ghostbusters, David Duchovny hunting aliens in a buddy-buddy double act with comedian Orlando Jones, and the likes of Jullianne Moore and Sean William Scott also at the peak of their popularity.As with all comedy, it's beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so it depends on your sense of humour as to how much you will take from Evolution. There is nothing sophisticated about it, but if you appreciate a bit of light goofiness, involving relatively juvenile characters blundering through an extreme situation you might enjoy. You need a healthy appreciation for jokes involving the anus to get the most out of it.Duchovny leads it well with a fairly charming performance and displays some nice touches of humour. Fans of 'The X-Files' should have fun.Jones has most of the best lines and delivers them perfectly. The hospital scene is easily the funniest part of the movie.Scott feels shoehorned into the story to cash in on his popularity at the time. He has some good manic energy, but for me crosses the line into the realm of annoying.Moore has little to do other than a few slapstick moments and play an attractive love interest.The visuals were top drawer at the time of production, but the CGI looks slightly dated on contemporary viewing. It's not bad enough to spoil the experience.

'Evolution' is the movie equivalent of your tonsils: You're not sure why they were made, and once you're done with them you're left with only pain and discomfort.Director Ivan Reitman has made some good stuff, most notably 'Ghostbusters.' This movie is 'Gross Bluster.' Like Ghostbusters, the plot revolves around some misfit scientists who discover a paranormal (this time alien) threat to humanity. But rather than ensuing hi-jinx, Evolution is hi-junk.
David Duchnovy plays the 'Bill Murray wacky scientist' character with alarming comedic indifference. His sidekick, Orlando Jones, is sort of Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, and Dan Ayckroyd rolled into one annoying character. Ayckroyd himself even makes a cameo, just to remind us we're watching 'Ghostbusters,' only without the laughs, story, characters, script, or direction.Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott round out one of the most wasted groups of talent in recent film memory. Most of the jokes (and the plot) revolve around Reitman's seemingly endless obsession with rear ends. Fitting, since that seems to be where 'Evolution' crawled out from: Ivan Reitman's rear end. For him, this is definitely 'De-volution.'

Seldom does one see a film so awful. Even Baby Geniuses wasn't this bad. Duchovny's comic timing is terrible, and the witty repartee that one normally finds in buddy movies such as this is completely lacking between Duchovny and Orlando Jones; it's absolutely amazing, watch this movie and you'll see that there is zero chemistry between the main characters. I wonder if this was deliberate.Here's one reason this movie doesn't make any sense: a meteor crashes to earth and a community college instructor and his buddy discover that life is evolving from the meteor. So now that the most astounding scientific discovery in thousands of years has happened right under their noses, what happens? They casually go about their normal routine, taking students on a field trip to visit the meteor, sitting around chatting, basically ignorant of the miracle that is happening under their very noses. It's so stupid, it just wouldn't happen like this unless the main characters were made out to be stupid in the first place, but Reitman doesn't take this angle. He plays it seriously like a black comedy, but then pulls out something stupid like the golf course dude falling asleep at his fireman exam. The characters aren't well defined at all. Why should I care about any of them, Reitman doesn't take the time to flesh them out, he seems to be ridiculing their superficiality while simultaneously starving them of the witty dialogue necessary to pull off a black comedy. The result is a mishmash of facial expressions and clichés mined from one hundred years of comedy and vaudeville, all thrown together in an attempt to get something to stick. It's like taking everything in your refrigerator and mixing it all together and hoping it will taste good.It doesn't.I'll echo the sentiments of another reviewer who said the film lost him when they were taking the mosquito thing out of Jones. If that isn't bad enough, Jones hops up and threatens the doctor never to do that again. So? Next time the doctor will just leave the insect inside of him? This movie is painfully stupid.

This movie is pretty much just a remake/update of Ghostbusters, with aliens instead of ghosts. This pretty much proves that director Ivan Reitman can't really do anything but this type of films. The plot is stupid and poorly paced. The acting is pretty decent, but that's also the only good thing about this film. The characters are all clichés and stereotypes. Most of the actors portray pretty much the exact same type of character that they usually do, so I don't know how much it really took for the actors to get into character or act their parts. The humor is childish, cheesy and juvenile throughout. The special effects look hideous. The science fiction elements are poor. The whole thing is just so throughly unfunny and dull that it's hard to put into words. It's boring and cheesy, never particularly funny and never engaging, exciting or interesting. I doubt anyone but the biggest of fans of Reitman or the actors involved would find this even marginally interesting. The whole thing about the shampoo in the end was so stupid I could actually feel my IQ dropping drastically. So, in conclusion, if you are a fan of the newer, apparently popular, one-note childish, juvenile crude humor as seen on shows like Family Guy and (sadly) recent episodes of The Simpsons, look no further... or, maybe, look further, as even that type of humor is better in other films... but, anyway, if you aren't, stay away. Far away. I recommend this to big fans of Reitman or the various actors, and of the aforementioned type of humor. 3/10

This film is an easy watch for a Saturday afternoon with the kids and the folks. Silly in places, but not in a bad way and generally just good fun.
There are no stand out characters or performers, because they all just play their parts well.
If you're in the mood for an easy giggle, then this is the film for you.

These ratings are low. I'd give Evolution a 7.5 if I could. Dry humor goes over big w/my family; we laughed a lot.Many of the best scenes are the hilarious/creepy attacks by alien critters.David Duchovny and Orlando Jones have great bro chemistry as professors Ira Caine and Harry Bloch, joined by 3rd musketeer Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore) as they chase down alien science after a meteor hits AZ, throwing a Buick Riviera 200 feet in the air.Yes, it's campy. The Moore pratfalls were dumb and the evil general is a done-to-death trope. But I laughed over Moore and Duchovny talking Jones through Lamaze breathing, some gross and creative product placement, Dan Akroyd as a goofy power player, and a hilariously overacted cameo from a young Sarah Silverman. Plus Duchovny as an extra dry straight man throughout.Popcorn time!

"Evolution" stars David Duchovny and Julianne Moore with Seann William Scott. It is a typical fun, pointless summer movie where you're just supposed to sit back, enjoy your popcorn and watch the monsters run around. The simple and predictable (but again fun) plot has a meteorite crash into the Earth, and it predictably contains alien organisms that rapidly evolve and begin attacking humans. Duchovny and Orlando Jones are two college science teachers who learn about this meteorite and the alien life forms it contained, and they try to solve the problem only to run into the army and namely the commander who has a big problem with Duchovny who used to be in his unit until he was discharged due to a horrible mistake he made. This is where they meet Julianne Moore's CDC character who is the only one involved with the military's operation who might listen to them. It's a comedy with a lot of jokes and silliness with some great special effects for the kind of movie this is, silly summer fun that's worth watching for sure.

Evolution is quite a fun little film. As two college teachers struggle with government agents to get credit for discovering aliens, said aliens rapidly evolve into a menace. Shampoo to the rescue!The main thing I would fault this movie with is that it does not quite get the balance of slapstick humor and character-driven humor right. The CDC director falls a little too often; the mooning scene does nothing for Duchovny's character; and getting sucked into the anus of a cell (whatever that is) might get the 8 year-olds to laugh, but not much anyone else.That said, the film is a whole lot of guilty fun! As a scientist, I was particularly happy to see that they stuck some real science in it, even though things got stretched - a whole lot - to accommodate the zany plot. I saw it again recently while giving my wife a back rub, and even she had to snicker a few times, although she protested when I hinted she might actually have enjoyed parts of this movie. It had aged well, despite the somewhat early-vintage special effects. I think this really has the making of a sci-fi comedy cult classic, with unforgettable set pieces like a snobbish employer of one of the main characters getting dragged from a golf course into oblivion by a gator-like evolved critter. Or the oh-so-cute alien turning out to have a vicious tongue! And of course, the chemistry between the five main characters (three good, one who turns good, and one despicable general) is good - an important ingredient in any comedy worth its salt.So I give this 7 stars, usually reserved for films good enough that I might see them more than once - as I did in this case.

This movie is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen. Everything about is ridiculous and unrealistic, and yet it is not the least bit funny. ALthough the movie is engaging, and there is some suspense, I hate how this movie follows uses all of those silly Hollywood clichés and stereotypes; aka "crazy, funny black guys", "dumb blondes", "cocky scientists", "evil generals", "dumb fat guys", and the list goes on. The creatures are sickeningly faux. And of course, the plot is the most unrealistic thing I have ever seen presented as ""scientific"".Overall, this movie brings you on a roller-coaster ride of stupidity with no end.

I had a chance to see Evolution last night at a preview screening.  Overall, the movie was enjoyable.  It was a good comedy.  Not, bust a gut funny, but funny.  The story was cookie-cutter.  Citizen discovers aliens, government takes over, aliens turn bad, citizens try and save the world.My biggest problem was with the characters.  Duchovny, Jones, and Moore all played scientists and they were either clumsy, dim-witted, or anything but smart acting, most of the time.  Jones did show that besides being funny he can be serious.  Sean Scott I fear is geting typecast as a the dropout goofball, but he's still funny and one of my favorite young actors.It's worth the time ( and $$) in the theater.

WOW! Wow is all I can say about the reviews of this movie here on this site. I wasn't going to waste my time writing a comment on such a piece of garbage cinema but when I started to read the reviews already posted here, I had to add a sane piece of insight.  THIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I absolutely flipped over backwards as I read the reviews of this film here saying it was great.  There is nothing to offer in this movie; atrocious witting, terrible acting, boring generic music and terrible visuals.  This is the epitome of generic Hollywood garbage film making.

Evolution is a step up from most gross-out comedies. With a nice idea for a plot, it starts off quite serious before the stars show their comic talents off. David Duchovny has good comic timing that hasn't really been tapped before, Orlando Jones is far better here than in Double Take and Say It Isn't So and Seann William Scott is a damn fine comic actor who uses his goofy charm to his advantage. Julianne Moore's constant falling over isn't funny, but you can't have everything. It's a shame that it flopped in the US, because it's really good. The special effects are decent, the turns are likeable and the script is loaded with sharp wit. OK, maybe some jokes go dead but seeing Orlando Jones getting lubricated after a bug enters his body and Scott singing to a flying monster in a mall is reason enough to go see this excellent summer blockbuster.

This is not going to be a great classic  but if you want broad humour and a silly story  with a few laugh-out-loud jokes  then this is definitely the film for you.  It is always nice to see Julianne Moore and she shows her comic side at its best.  Her portrayal of Alison Reed, the clumsy scientist from the Center for Disease Control, is probably her best comedic turn to date. 
David Duchovny is out chasing aliens again and, in some ways, spoofs his `X-Files' character; he was a good bit of casting.  He has good comic timing and his deadpan delivery is perfect for the character.  He and Ms Moore have good screen chemistry and it would be nice to see them together again.More directors need to think of Orlando Jones when casting films  He really can act and, while the material in `Evolution' doesn't offer too many opportunities to do so, he takes the chances he is given and runs with them. Seann William Scott (Wayne Green) has the not-too-bright good guy' role down letter-perfect.  He has some of the better lines in the movie and, remembering that this is a farce, is probably the most believable character in the movie.The location photography is, at times, dazzling; however, some of the special effects looked very cheesy  very obvious green screen' shots  so obvious that I wondered if they were bad on purpose.  Unfortunately the sound track detracts from the overall end product: it seldom had anything to do with the action on the screen and sometimes was outright annoying.This is a good summer movie:  just go, laugh and don't think too much.

Rented this movie this past holiday weekend.  What a tragic waste.  The movie plot is disjointed.  The dialogue and acting weak.  Little to nothing is actually funny about the plot, characters, or their interactions with each other or the aliens.David Duchovny, who does an okay job in this unfunny movie, seems out of place trying to do comedy with an Xfiles-type investigative character.Julianne Moore play an uncoordinated government scientist.  Her character is neither engaging nor believable.The only saving grace of this movie is Orlando Jones who's character does deliver some funny lines.  But unfortunately his persona is unable to rescue this ill-made movie.

While this film is far from a masterpiece, Evolution deserves better ratings than it currently enjoys here at IMDb. The cast and crew contribute superior work, and the storyline is quite inventive. The premise has been done a few times before, however, it has never been done quite as well as the treatment it receives here.Alien spores land here on Earth and begin to wreak havoc.I found this highly entertaining, cleverly witty, with a slick production quality which tends to draw in the audience, who finds its members laughing, sometimes in spite of themselves.

I can't say I suspected much from the previews.  I anticipated another lame comedy and a cheap imitation of "Men in Black."

This is a simply good fun creature movie the acting was good the creatures were good the plot line good the comedy good in essence 90 minutes well spent.

When I first read about Evolution, the latest sci-fi scheme to come from DreamWorks, I was interested.  A story about aliens with humor, not bad. Then when I read that Ivan Reitman, the BEST comedic director of the 80's and one of the best of all time was at the helm, I was thrilled.  I mean, come on, after he was given duds like `Father's Day' and `Six Days, Seven Nights' to work with, isn't it about time that Hollywood gave him a project worth while (I won't even mention the bombastic disaster of `Junior'oh, I just did)?It begins with the introduction of Scott's character, Wayne Green, a wannabe fireman practicing for his fireman final (questionable at first, hilarious in the end).  Then he gets an unexpected visitor - a meteor, carrying alien organisms hits the heart of the Arizona desert. After a community college science professor, Ira Kane Duchovny, working with one screwed up screen name)and his eccentric geologist buddy, Harry Block (Jones) discover the meteor, they find that the `bleeding' rock starts to create these weird alien creatures and soon they begin to multiply.  Kane's nemeses, Gen. Woodman (Levine) and the military get involved, things get too out-of-control, so it's up to the teaming of Kane, Block, Green and government scientist Allison Reed (Moore) to stop the evolution.If you're a Reitman fan, the plot of this could make you go in expecting some kind of tribute to both `Ghostbusters'.  In a way it is, and is that a bad thing?  Hell no!  If you liked, or even loved (like me) `Ghostbusters', I can bet my clean pair of boxers that you'll get a hoot out of `Evolution'. But of course any film must maintain some distance from the films its being compared too, and `Evolution' does that.  The characters and situations are different, atmospherically.  Duchovny turns in a `cool' performance, by that meaning he wasn't Mr. Badass or Mr. Laugh-a-Minute, he was just, well, Duchovny and that itself is always pleasing to watch.  Jones is his usual funny self, delivering some funny lines. Moore's ability to do just about anything comes in handy here, playing the hottie-yet-clumsy love interest. Scott's acting resembles the other roles he's done in the past, and I've come to appreciate that (that thing he does w/ his eyebrow is getting funnier every time).  Can't say the same for Levine; his cliché performance as the bad-guy-who-doesn't-listen character gets annoying fast.A lot of the film makes me question what it is, and really what it could have been.  The script, penned by three writers, was originally written as a sci-fi THRILLER, not a sci-fi comedy.  There were a lot of laughs, but because of the script's origin, there could have been more.  But considering the script was originally a sci-fi thriller, the filmmakers, including Reitman, did a great job.  Can't say much for the ending, though: the ending looks and feels like a meshed-up result of what-could-have-been, and from that mushiness, the filmmakers poked at and took at least some of the good elements.  Thank god the film is a comedy; if it was its original idea, the ending would have been disastrous.`Evolution' is a overall crowd-pleaser with nice special effects and makeup (those dead aliens looked great).  It's a few laughs and comedic situations short of comedic greatness, but look on the bright side-Reitman is back in his lovable kick-ass form.  He's tapped into the present and how most comedies are made, but he didn't dare forget his roots: there is a sequence in the film where Duchovny, Jones and Scott chase down a flying creature in a mall.  The three, equipped with shotguns, dispose of it in true Ghostbusters style.  And with me being a big Ghostbusters fan, I fell in love with the it, plus its the best scene in the film. (The trio singing after their battle; nice touch).GRADE: B+

Let me say this: I was never a fan of Ghostbusters.  I guess I never got in on the bandwagon on that one.  I never found it to be as funny as a lot of people (tons of people actually) found it.  I thought parts of it were cool (like the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man), but most of the movie was too drab for me, for some reason.  Someday I'll write a review of it, but I'm too lazy to do it right now.  Why am I talking about Ghostbusters when I'm reviewing Evolution, some of you ask?  Well, it's simple.  The same man directs both movies (Ivan Reitman) and both movies have very similar plots.  Except that, in my opinion, Evolution is better.  Basically, think of Evolution as a remake of Ghostbusters only throw out the ghosts and put in aliens, which I like because aliens, in my opinion, are cooler and more realistic than ghosts.Let me mention some bad stuff, just to get it over with because I have to do at some point.  This movie misses some serious opportunities to be funny. Sometimes, when you are expecting a joke, there is none.  It's almost as if they really weren't trying.  Sometimes the jokes are a little corny.
One last bad note: some of the aliens suck.  The ending alien is a bit of a let down.  It kind of reminded me of Akira, if you've seen that movie. There is also this cute alien who turns out to be nasty via the "mouth within a mouth", a la Ridley Scott's Alien.Now on to some good stuff.  This movie is really funny in a happy kind of way.  I compare the mood of this movie to another Dreamworks alien-comedy, Galaxy Quest (a movie I thought was hilarious).  If you liked Galaxy Quest, and I think most people did, then you will like Evolution.Something else I would like to point out is how scientific Evolution is. The movie seems very intelligent as far as talking about how the aliens evolve.  I for one and happy to see a movie that isn't completely dumbed down for the uneducated.  I like alien stuff and space stuff, so this kind of science interests me.  Overall, I found Evolution to be very intriguing apart from being funny.Oh, I want to mention Orlando Jones.  He's the black guy from those 7-Up commercials.  I love this guy.  He steals the show in this movie.  I knew the guy was great ever since I saw the first of those 7-Up commercials.  He was also in the Replacements (that lame football comedy which was also somewhat entertaining), and he's probably been in some other stuff I haven't seen or can't remember.  But let me tell you, this guy is going places.  As for the other actors, they're decent.  I like the touch of having David Duchovny on board.  Julian Moore is a good actress, but she got shafted in the character department.  She has a basic "walking cardboard cutout" character with little personality.  Oh well.In conclusion, please do me a favor of not going into this movie expecting a great movie.  Why do people do that?  Every movie can't be the Godfather or 2001 or Saving Private Ryan, so why don't you just shut up and enjoy the movie.  You won't look back at Evolution at the end of the summer as you favorite summer movie this year, but you're not supposed to.  Evolution was made to be entertaining, not great.  It was made to give you your money's worth and put forth an enjoyable show.  I think it accomplishes its mission.7/10

A duo of small town college professors stumble upon a meteor with alien life present. This is great news for them, at least until they find out that the alien evolves and reproduces at a rapid rate, so much that the earth may be devoured in a matter of days.This film's strong point? David Duchovny. While the jokes are so-so and the plot is a pleasant variation of "The Blob", it is Duchovny that makes this film watchable. Without him, it would be easily forgettable and probably wouldn't have the underground geek following that it does. I also appreciated the brief appearance from Sarah Silverman.A few years later, the film "Slither" came out which once again tackles the idea of an evolving, blob-like life form. I think "Slither" is the better film: better effects, much more horror-oriented and still with a healthy dose of comedy. Though I wouldn't say it made "Evolution" entirely obsolete -- they are two distinct films with distinct charms that may appeal to different audiences.

A meteorite hits Earth causing the accelerated evolution of an alien life form.This is a silly comedy with some enjoyable moments.Evolution attempts to cash in on some established formula, such as the spectacle-driven comedy of Ghostbusters, David Duchovny hunting aliens in a buddy-buddy double act with comedian Orlando Jones, and the likes of Jullianne Moore and Sean William Scott also at the peak of their popularity.As with all comedy, it's beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so it depends on your sense of humour as to how much you will take from Evolution. There is nothing sophisticated about it, but if you appreciate a bit of light goofiness, involving relatively juvenile characters blundering through an extreme situation you might enjoy. You need a healthy appreciation for jokes involving the anus to get the most out of it.Duchovny leads it well with a fairly charming performance and displays some nice touches of humour. Fans of 'The X-Files' should have fun.Jones has most of the best lines and delivers them perfectly. The hospital scene is easily the funniest part of the movie.Scott feels shoehorned into the story to cash in on his popularity at the time. He has some good manic energy, but for me crosses the line into the realm of annoying.Moore has little to do other than a few slapstick moments and play an attractive love interest.The visuals were top drawer at the time of production, but the CGI looks slightly dated on contemporary viewing. It's not bad enough to spoil the experience.

'Evolution' is the movie equivalent of your tonsils: You're not sure why they were made, and once you're done with them you're left with only pain and discomfort.Director Ivan Reitman has made some good stuff, most notably 'Ghostbusters.' This movie is 'Gross Bluster.' Like Ghostbusters, the plot revolves around some misfit scientists who discover a paranormal (this time alien) threat to humanity. But rather than ensuing hi-jinx, Evolution is hi-junk.
David Duchnovy plays the 'Bill Murray wacky scientist' character with alarming comedic indifference. His sidekick, Orlando Jones, is sort of Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, and Dan Ayckroyd rolled into one annoying character. Ayckroyd himself even makes a cameo, just to remind us we're watching 'Ghostbusters,' only without the laughs, story, characters, script, or direction.Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott round out one of the most wasted groups of talent in recent film memory. Most of the jokes (and the plot) revolve around Reitman's seemingly endless obsession with rear ends. Fitting, since that seems to be where 'Evolution' crawled out from: Ivan Reitman's rear end. For him, this is definitely 'De-volution.'

Evolution is a decent goofy Sci-Fi movie about an alien invasion that strikes in the deserts of Arizona. A couple of community college professors discover microscopic life living in a meteor that strikes just outside of town. The catch? The life may be small, but it's complex structure allows it to evolve at billions of times the rate that life on earth does. Soon they and the quirky community they live in are dealing with prehistoric critters rapidly evolving up the ladder towards intelligence, and consuming everything in their path as they do so.Tl;dr, the film is decent but doesn't reach its full potential, and not all the humor/references in the film have aged gracefully, but if you can watch it for free on one of your streaming subscriptions it's not a bad lazy Sunday movie.The plot is reasonably interesting for a movie that you've probably never heard of. Part of that is that the movie was released just a few months before 9/11, but even before the national tragedy kind of killed everyone's interest in watching lighthearted comedies for a while the movie wasn't doing especially well. It wasn't bombing, it more or less just broke even in theaters. The problem is it doesn't land its jokes or big scenes very well. I don't know if it's the directing or editing or even the delivery, but a lot of moments that feel like they could have been fun are reduced to a 'meh' feeling.The comedic timing is often off, causing a lot of the big jokes to fall flat or only hit with a fraction of the energy it seems like they could have. Also, some of the jokes that were highlighted in previews at the time haven't aged well, like a scene in which David Duchovny's character states that he doesn't trust government agent types, a joke that references Duchovny's then-famous role as a government agent in the cultural phenomenon show 'The X-Files' . And finally, some of the cast like Dan Akroyd were clearly just doing someone a favor appearing in the movie and feel a little tacked on as their characters only appear in a few narrow scenes and aren't well integrated with the other characters stories.All of which is too bad, because if you get past those issues the plot of the movie is pretty original and interesting in a don't-take-it-too-seriously kind of way. Even when they are turning into monsters the critters are usually brightly colored and cute in an alien muppet way, keeping the horror aspects from overwhelming the comedic. And the CGI, while obviously not anywhere near modern levels of quality, is still pretty decent.The cast is also strong, including many actors who were relative unknowns when the movie was released but would go on to have successful careers. I liked the choice of making Duchovny and Jones scientific wannabees at a community college rather than Ivy league world famous types, which makes their characters more approachable, but I did feel that the movie left Moore a little underused. As the sole legitimate Ivy league world famous type, it might have been more fun to throw the big discoveries about the aliens to her and leave Duchovny and Jones in a more Rosencrantz and Guildenstern type of role, reacting to the big events rather than driving them. I might have also edited out Seann William Scott's role, or at least edited it to make him more integrated into the main characters lives. It seems obvious they wanted him as a third musketeer kind of thing but the connection between him and the professors feels super forced.So it didn't completely bore me, but it didn't blow me away either. In the end it felt like there was maybe a better movie hiding somewhere in it, but I don't regret rewatching it.

Seldom does one see a film so awful. Even Baby Geniuses wasn't this bad. Duchovny's comic timing is terrible, and the witty repartee that one normally finds in buddy movies such as this is completely lacking between Duchovny and Orlando Jones; it's absolutely amazing, watch this movie and you'll see that there is zero chemistry between the main characters. I wonder if this was deliberate.Here's one reason this movie doesn't make any sense: a meteor crashes to earth and a community college instructor and his buddy discover that life is evolving from the meteor. So now that the most astounding scientific discovery in thousands of years has happened right under their noses, what happens? They casually go about their normal routine, taking students on a field trip to visit the meteor, sitting around chatting, basically ignorant of the miracle that is happening under their very noses. It's so stupid, it just wouldn't happen like this unless the main characters were made out to be stupid in the first place, but Reitman doesn't take this angle. He plays it seriously like a black comedy, but then pulls out something stupid like the golf course dude falling asleep at his fireman exam. The characters aren't well defined at all. Why should I care about any of them, Reitman doesn't take the time to flesh them out, he seems to be ridiculing their superficiality while simultaneously starving them of the witty dialogue necessary to pull off a black comedy. The result is a mishmash of facial expressions and clichés mined from one hundred years of comedy and vaudeville, all thrown together in an attempt to get something to stick. It's like taking everything in your refrigerator and mixing it all together and hoping it will taste good.It doesn't.I'll echo the sentiments of another reviewer who said the film lost him when they were taking the mosquito thing out of Jones. If that isn't bad enough, Jones hops up and threatens the doctor never to do that again. So? Next time the doctor will just leave the insect inside of him? This movie is painfully stupid.

A lot has been said about what's good and bad in the movie. I won't revisit those comments. I thought the creatures were creative and hysterical.Sure they weren't logical or realistic, but they were fun in a fantasy sort of sense. I enjoyed the watching the entire alien "ecosystem" evolve.Fortunately, I'm the kind of person that understands a movie made to be predominantly a comedy doesn't require scientific accuracy, nor should the audience expect it. It was intentionally silly.One last thing. I thought David Duchovny did a great job playing a character that had a wry, dry sense of humor. He wasn't exactly a straight man, but it was clear to me, he was laughing at the world.Rating, I gave it 8/10 because it entertained me AND my wife, something many movies can't do.

OK, so it's not as good as "Independence Day," but at least it's not as bad as some less-than-B movies out there ("Mars Attacks!"). It wasn't the best acted, but it was fun to watch. The plot is stupid, the aliens are cheesy, and there are plot holes that you could drive a fire engine through (see the movie for why I chose that metaphor). But, the movie doesn't take itself seriously, and therefore if you watch it just for the fun of it, you won't be disappointed. David Duchovny is hilarious, poking fun at his character from the "X-Files," Fox Mulder, and Seann William Scott is what you would expect, although I thought casting him in the "American Pie" movies was more appropriate. Otherwise, the actors were listless (Julianne Moore), or cliché (Orlando Jones). But it was worth seeing, and I admit I laughed. I wouldn't consider this classic cinema, but if you have nothing to do one rainy afternoon, go see this funny and enjoyable movie.

This movie is pretty much just a remake/update of Ghostbusters, with aliens instead of ghosts. This pretty much proves that director Ivan Reitman can't really do anything but this type of films. The plot is stupid and poorly paced. The acting is pretty decent, but that's also the only good thing about this film. The characters are all clichés and stereotypes. Most of the actors portray pretty much the exact same type of character that they usually do, so I don't know how much it really took for the actors to get into character or act their parts. The humor is childish, cheesy and juvenile throughout. The special effects look hideous. The science fiction elements are poor. The whole thing is just so throughly unfunny and dull that it's hard to put into words. It's boring and cheesy, never particularly funny and never engaging, exciting or interesting. I doubt anyone but the biggest of fans of Reitman or the actors involved would find this even marginally interesting. The whole thing about the shampoo in the end was so stupid I could actually feel my IQ dropping drastically. So, in conclusion, if you are a fan of the newer, apparently popular, one-note childish, juvenile crude humor as seen on shows like Family Guy and (sadly) recent episodes of The Simpsons, look no further... or, maybe, look further, as even that type of humor is better in other films... but, anyway, if you aren't, stay away. Far away. I recommend this to big fans of Reitman or the various actors, and of the aforementioned type of humor. 3/10

Evolution is meant to be nothing but a fun flick and that what is. The fil is vein of Ghostbusters and has very funny moments. Seann William Scott makes this movie for me though. He's on the verge of being a superstar. The atcion sequences and direction also make this a good film. Check it out for a good time.

These ratings are low. I'd give Evolution a 7.5 if I could. Dry humor goes over big w/my family; we laughed a lot.Many of the best scenes are the hilarious/creepy attacks by alien critters.David Duchovny and Orlando Jones have great bro chemistry as professors Ira Caine and Harry Bloch, joined by 3rd musketeer Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore) as they chase down alien science after a meteor hits AZ, throwing a Buick Riviera 200 feet in the air.Yes, it's campy. The Moore pratfalls were dumb and the evil general is a done-to-death trope. But I laughed over Moore and Duchovny talking Jones through Lamaze breathing, some gross and creative product placement, Dan Akroyd as a goofy power player, and a hilariously overacted cameo from a young Sarah Silverman. Plus Duchovny as an extra dry straight man throughout.Popcorn time!

This film is an easy watch for a Saturday afternoon with the kids and the folks. Silly in places, but not in a bad way and generally just good fun.
There are no stand out characters or performers, because they all just play their parts well.
If you're in the mood for an easy giggle, then this is the film for you.

"Evolution" stars David Duchovny and Julianne Moore with Seann William Scott. It is a typical fun, pointless summer movie where you're just supposed to sit back, enjoy your popcorn and watch the monsters run around. The simple and predictable (but again fun) plot has a meteorite crash into the Earth, and it predictably contains alien organisms that rapidly evolve and begin attacking humans. Duchovny and Orlando Jones are two college science teachers who learn about this meteorite and the alien life forms it contained, and they try to solve the problem only to run into the army and namely the commander who has a big problem with Duchovny who used to be in his unit until he was discharged due to a horrible mistake he made. This is where they meet Julianne Moore's CDC character who is the only one involved with the military's operation who might listen to them. It's a comedy with a lot of jokes and silliness with some great special effects for the kind of movie this is, silly summer fun that's worth watching for sure.

Evolution is quite a fun little film. As two college teachers struggle with government agents to get credit for discovering aliens, said aliens rapidly evolve into a menace. Shampoo to the rescue!The main thing I would fault this movie with is that it does not quite get the balance of slapstick humor and character-driven humor right. The CDC director falls a little too often; the mooning scene does nothing for Duchovny's character; and getting sucked into the anus of a cell (whatever that is) might get the 8 year-olds to laugh, but not much anyone else.That said, the film is a whole lot of guilty fun! As a scientist, I was particularly happy to see that they stuck some real science in it, even though things got stretched - a whole lot - to accommodate the zany plot. I saw it again recently while giving my wife a back rub, and even she had to snicker a few times, although she protested when I hinted she might actually have enjoyed parts of this movie. It had aged well, despite the somewhat early-vintage special effects. I think this really has the making of a sci-fi comedy cult classic, with unforgettable set pieces like a snobbish employer of one of the main characters getting dragged from a golf course into oblivion by a gator-like evolved critter. Or the oh-so-cute alien turning out to have a vicious tongue! And of course, the chemistry between the five main characters (three good, one who turns good, and one despicable general) is good - an important ingredient in any comedy worth its salt.So I give this 7 stars, usually reserved for films good enough that I might see them more than once - as I did in this case.

This movie is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen. Everything about is ridiculous and unrealistic, and yet it is not the least bit funny. ALthough the movie is engaging, and there is some suspense, I hate how this movie follows uses all of those silly Hollywood clichés and stereotypes; aka "crazy, funny black guys", "dumb blondes", "cocky scientists", "evil generals", "dumb fat guys", and the list goes on. The creatures are sickeningly faux. And of course, the plot is the most unrealistic thing I have ever seen presented as ""scientific"".Overall, this movie brings you on a roller-coaster ride of stupidity with no end.

I had a chance to see Evolution last night at a preview screening.  Overall, the movie was enjoyable.  It was a good comedy.  Not, bust a gut funny, but funny.  The story was cookie-cutter.  Citizen discovers aliens, government takes over, aliens turn bad, citizens try and save the world.My biggest problem was with the characters.  Duchovny, Jones, and Moore all played scientists and they were either clumsy, dim-witted, or anything but smart acting, most of the time.  Jones did show that besides being funny he can be serious.  Sean Scott I fear is geting typecast as a the dropout goofball, but he's still funny and one of my favorite young actors.It's worth the time ( and $$) in the theater.

WOW! Wow is all I can say about the reviews of this movie here on this site. I wasn't going to waste my time writing a comment on such a piece of garbage cinema but when I started to read the reviews already posted here, I had to add a sane piece of insight.  THIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I absolutely flipped over backwards as I read the reviews of this film here saying it was great.  There is nothing to offer in this movie; atrocious witting, terrible acting, boring generic music and terrible visuals.  This is the epitome of generic Hollywood garbage film making.

Evolution is a step up from most gross-out comedies. With a nice idea for a plot, it starts off quite serious before the stars show their comic talents off. David Duchovny has good comic timing that hasn't really been tapped before, Orlando Jones is far better here than in Double Take and Say It Isn't So and Seann William Scott is a damn fine comic actor who uses his goofy charm to his advantage. Julianne Moore's constant falling over isn't funny, but you can't have everything. It's a shame that it flopped in the US, because it's really good. The special effects are decent, the turns are likeable and the script is loaded with sharp wit. OK, maybe some jokes go dead but seeing Orlando Jones getting lubricated after a bug enters his body and Scott singing to a flying monster in a mall is reason enough to go see this excellent summer blockbuster.

This is not going to be a great classic  but if you want broad humour and a silly story  with a few laugh-out-loud jokes  then this is definitely the film for you.  It is always nice to see Julianne Moore and she shows her comic side at its best.  Her portrayal of Alison Reed, the clumsy scientist from the Center for Disease Control, is probably her best comedic turn to date. 
David Duchovny is out chasing aliens again and, in some ways, spoofs his `X-Files' character; he was a good bit of casting.  He has good comic timing and his deadpan delivery is perfect for the character.  He and Ms Moore have good screen chemistry and it would be nice to see them together again.More directors need to think of Orlando Jones when casting films  He really can act and, while the material in `Evolution' doesn't offer too many opportunities to do so, he takes the chances he is given and runs with them. Seann William Scott (Wayne Green) has the not-too-bright good guy' role down letter-perfect.  He has some of the better lines in the movie and, remembering that this is a farce, is probably the most believable character in the movie.The location photography is, at times, dazzling; however, some of the special effects looked very cheesy  very obvious green screen' shots  so obvious that I wondered if they were bad on purpose.  Unfortunately the sound track detracts from the overall end product: it seldom had anything to do with the action on the screen and sometimes was outright annoying.This is a good summer movie:  just go, laugh and don't think too much.

Rented this movie this past holiday weekend.  What a tragic waste.  The movie plot is disjointed.  The dialogue and acting weak.  Little to nothing is actually funny about the plot, characters, or their interactions with each other or the aliens.David Duchovny, who does an okay job in this unfunny movie, seems out of place trying to do comedy with an Xfiles-type investigative character.Julianne Moore play an uncoordinated government scientist.  Her character is neither engaging nor believable.The only saving grace of this movie is Orlando Jones who's character does deliver some funny lines.  But unfortunately his persona is unable to rescue this ill-made movie.
