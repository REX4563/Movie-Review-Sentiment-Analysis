In 1989, the teenager Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) is the star of the Hayden High-School. On the day of the final basketball game, Mike will be observed and may win a scholarship in college. However, his girlfriend Scarlett (Allison Miller) tells him that she is pregnant and Mike does not play the game. Twenty years later, Mike (Matthew Perry) is a complete loser that blames Scar for his failures: he is not promoted to sale manager after working sixteen years in the same company; Scarlett (Leslie Mann) is divorcing him; his teenagers son Alex (Sterling Knight) and daughter Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) hate him; and he is temporarily living with his best friend, the eccentric and immature millionaire Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon). Mike nostalgically visits Hayden where an old janitor talks to him about second chance in life. During the night, he sees the janitor jumping from a bridge into the river and he unsuccessfully tries to help the man. Mike passes out and when he wakes up, he discovers that he is seventeen again. Further, he discovers that he has a second chance to fix his relationship with his family."17 Again" is another good movie about second chance in life. I believe most of people in a certain age question decisions took in the past and would like to have a second chance to re-route his or her life in that milestone. The cinema makes this dream come true and certainly the story is pleasant for most of the people. In addition, the two lead stars (Zac Efron and Matthew Perry) are nice actors and the result is a nice entertainment for whole family. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "17 Outra Vez" ("17 Again")

As we've seen many movies like this before: Big, 13 Going on 30, and Freaky Friday, we always love to see the retelling of the old classic story of the switching age. Since the story has been used so much, a director can only do so much to just do the best they can with, Burr Steers pulls 17 Again out with great laughs and good fun. I'm going to get this out, I am one of the rare girls that just doesn't get the whole Zac Efron heart throb thing, I agree that he's cute, but with mainly High School Musical only being his claim to fame other than Hairspray, he is adorable, but can he act? Surprisingly he can. I can't believe I'm saying this, he was actually a good strong lead role and a perfect fit, he has charisma, he's funny, charming and makes this story worth your time and money.In 1989, Michael O'Donnell was a star athlete with a full college scholarship imminent. He seemingly had it all, when, right before the championship game, his girlfriend Scarlett informed him she was pregnant. In that moment, he made the decision to throw everything away and proposed to her. Twenty years later, Mike's life isn't exactly what he expected it to be. Scarlett wants a divorce from him, forcing him to move in with his geeky millionaire best friend Ned, his job is going nowhere, and his kids Maggie and Alex want nothing to do with him. While paying a visit to Hayden High School to reminisce about the life he threw away, he encounters a strange beardy janitor, who I still swear is Bob Haskins. On the way home, is magically transformed back into his 17-year old self. With Ned posing as his father, he re-enrolls in high school, believing he has been given the chance to have his life over again, "but to do it right". However, he then discovers that his daughter is dating the basketball captain Stan, who is bullying his son. He realizes that his real mission is to help his children as well as finding out that maybe his decision wasn't the worst he ever made in his life.We go a little Back to the Future-esquire when we get on the creepy level of Michelle Trachtenberg having a crush on Zac Efron who is her father, just that she can't recognize him, it's understanding, but still makes you squirm, but the director and actors pulled the scene off pretty well with getting out of that yucky situation. There is one continuity error: if Mike and his girl got pregnant at the age of 17... 20 years later, yet both their kids are still in high school, the oldest child would only be a maximum of 18. A plot hole: seriously, besides the wife, no one at all recognizes Mike? But I'm over thinking the movie too much at this point, it's just a fun movie with decent performances, I just need to let go of silly mistakes. So I would recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, but I'd say more of a matinée vs. a full price ticket, it has some good laughs and was a great update of the "What if you could go back?" story.7/10

I went to see this with film with my teenage daughter and really wasn't expecting to enjoy it. I settled down in my seat for the duration and the first few scenes showing Efron as a high school basketball player had me groaning inwardly as I assumed that this was going to be another predictable high school/age swap film of the type that has been done so many times before - and really isn't the sort of film I would choose to see anyway. Not a promising start. However, I was pleasantly surprised by 17 Again. It was witty and well acted and made me laugh out loud - not something I often do even when I appreciate the humour in a film.This film's appeal is also strengthened by the acting of the supporting characters as well as the main ones - Thomas Lennon's character was particularly well delivered. I found no fault with Zac Efron's acting in this and I enjoyed his performance in Hairspray but it would be interesting to see him in a serious grown up dramatic role.

Every teen generation needs a good body swap/turn the clock back type of story and 17 again is one of those stories, Mike O'Donnell had it all. He was the star of his high schools basket ball team. He had Scarlet the most beautiful girl in the school as his girlfriend. Right before the game that could make him into a star, Scarlet tells Mike she's pregnant, Mike makes a drastic and life altering decision and runs out of the game to be with her giving up his chances of becoming a basket ball star, now 20 years later Mike's regretting it all and wishes he could do it all over again, and by some miraculous way he does.17 again is a cool and stylish what if movie, it brings to light the question of what if you could change your life, if you could live it all over again.What would you do different? That's the question this movie propose and tells with a grand lush style that resonates with the teen population and even with the adults too, 17 again is not just some teen movie, it's a movie that even adults between the ages of 30-50 would enjoy it, my dad sure did. But this film has it's flaws and some very minor bad dialogue from Zack Efron but nothing that would hamper this films style or production, but in my honest opinion this film was very good, this movie is not Oscar worthy but it's definitely worth the price of admission.

Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) was a teen basketball jock with all the potential in the world. When his girlfriend got pregnant, he abandons it all to marry her. Now they're adults, Mike (Matthew Perry) can't stop blaming all his problems on this decision. His wife Scarlet (Leslie Mann) divorces him. Then one night, a guardian angel sends Mike through a vortex and turns him back into a teen again. He decides to go back to high school to relive his high school years, but instead he reconnects with his family.Thomas Lennon does his wacky best friend. It's basically 'Big' in reverse. The story isn't anything new or original. Zac Efron is quite funny as the fish out of water. He's surprisingly great as a compelling lead. It's his performance and his energy that drives this movie. The trick is that he's not playing a teen. He's playing mid-30s in a body of a teen.

I didn't think I would like this movie and yet I actually really did! First thing that makes one feel a bit reluctant about this movie is the fact that we saw this story hundreds of time. The going back in time/being a teen again stories are very popular. And yes, this one is another of them. Main reason I can't rate it is higher than 7 is because it lacks originality and it is easy to predict what happens and how it ends.Yet, this does not ruin the movie. It has a fresh and funny dialogue and an amazing cast.Actually I would like to apologize to Zac Effron. I never saw a movie with him before and only knew that he is loved by teenage girls. So when I started watching I was ind of resenting the idea that soon Mathew Perry, who is a funny actor, will be replaced by Zac Effron for the most of the movie. Yet, it didn't turn out as a bad thing. He is actually a very good and funny actor. Next time I see that he is in the cast, I will consider it a positive thing.The rest of the cast was great as well, a special mentioning deserves Thomas Lennon whose character Ned made me laugh through the movie.It is a very PG movie. I was very happy about the fact that they didn't make it too cheesy. It had its moments but for the most it is just light entertainment. I am not even the target audience, I think for the most it is appealing to teenagers or parents who miss their school days. I am neither and yet I liked it,so its a well done job.

This is another movie I watched with my friend who works at a movie theatre. With elements of Big and 13 Going on 30, not to mention It's a Wonderful Life and Back to the Future, 17 Again is a pretty enjoyable meshing of those movies considering the cast which has Zac Efron, Michelle Trachtenberg, Leslie Mann, Margaret Cho, Thomas Lennon, and Melora Hardin. I also recognized Matthew Perry and Nicole Sullivan. I did not realize until the cast credits that the bearded janitor at the high school was Brian Doyle-Murray, Bill's brother. Now, parts of the plot and characterizations were a little uneven but despite that there were plenty of scenes that were hilarious especially those between Lennon and Hardin. With them, I also saw a little "Big Bang Theory" vibe. Oh, and there's a little touching pro-abstinence speech here as well (though it still is acknowledged that not all teens will feel that way). All in all, despite some adult humor, 17 Again was an enjoyable comedy that should be enjoyable enough for parents and offspring alike. Oh, and one more thing: I thought the Vanilla Ice reference in the 1989 sequence didn't fit since I remember him not even emerging until the following year...

Why does this movie have only a six? Is it because of Efron? I thought this movie was just smart and not lacking in any way. The script was hilarious and had a full good plot line, the casting was great (Zac Efron really made you believe he was married with children... looking 17!) and even the smaller roles were really great additions. I've seen this movie thrice and trust me, it's not just for Efron (which I assume is why people are hating on it - stop the bias!), it's genuinely well written, directed, acted... etc. Brilliant! Will see again... 17 Again.

I have to admit I am not a big fan of Zac Efron, but I saw 17 Again expecting to hate it but actually it wasn't that bad. Yes, the story is predictable, yes the pacing is uneven and yes the ending is a bit of a letdown.However, there are a lot of redeeming merits. The soundtrack is excellent, and the script is surprisingly decent with just the right amount of quirky humour. The direction is good, while the acting is not bad at all. The characters are a little clichéd admittedly, but the actors do their best to make the most of their characters. Zac Efron gives a great performance in the lead and fits perfectly with the film's tone. Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann are both good too, but it is Efron's film all the way.Overall, not bad actually quite enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox

I truly have become more convinced that Hollywood has been bankrupt of good ideas or good filmmakers who are in touch with what the audience really want to see. Boring, unimaginative, and completely lacking of good film-making. This film clearly show a complete lack of passion and vision. It imitates what others have so brilliantly forged but still falls flat. Burr Steers? Can someone say the emperor has no clothes? I would have loved to have been sitting in that studio/executive's office during the pitch for this concept. Why were they not thrown out on their behind, I will never know. What do they expect when they start with a very lame script, and then hire a completely inadequate director, Burr Steers, who does not know the craft if it were fed to him with a silver spoon. But wait, I think that is exactly how he got his job...not his skill but his inner connections. The agent for Zac should be fired for choosing such a vehicle to launch his rise into a leading man. Burr steers should never go near comedy again or even near film-making in general.

The storyline was very well done and enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. Keep an open mind and you will enjoy the movie.Zac Efron did a really decent acting job. I honestly thought it would be High School Musical-like but it turned out to be a nice movie to watch. If he keeps up the good work and takes it to the next level, he can really be an A level quality star. Zac is no Matthew Macfadden yet but there is potential.There are two recasts I would have done. Matthew Perry wasn't fully right for this role. He has a comedic bent but it wasn't used at all in this movie - hence a total waste and was a mismatch from a character perspective. I think John Stamos would have been better. Also Michelle Trachtenberg playing the teenager was a bit much. Trachtenberg is a solid actress but for a teenager, a different actress would have been better.It is a very nice movie and I usually rate a movie on whether it's worth paying full price, matinée, video store, Netflix or don't bother. The movie was worth paying full price.

Matthew Perry has had an up an down film career but this isn't through lack of effort. The main problem is that in many of his films (which don't get me wrong I really like) he plays a character too similar to his character on the hit sitcom Friends. However here he is takes on a role I doubt anyone could have predicted and does very well in the limited screen time he had. Sure there are flashes of Chandler here but by and large it is a different type of character. This is obviously a vehicle for Zac Efron and everything in this film is centred around him because of this. He proves in 17 again that he can be more than just that kid from High School Musical and can actually act. He is ably supported by Leslie Mann and Thomas Lennon and overall this film is light, funny and entertaining and at times heart warming film that Matthew Perry is a big part of. of this.

Maybe it's just because I'm not really into these teen romance movies, but I really wasn't impressed. If I'm honest, I was actually expecting it to be mildly entertaining. Entertaining in a bad way, but still entertaining. However, it wasn't even that.The only parts of the movie that I actually enjoyed were Efron's sudden change into Perry, and Efron's character's wife failing to recognise him, after he became '17 again'. I found it quite remarkable that ones appearance can be changed so dramatically after ageing a couple of decades. What was almost as incredible is the fact that Efron and his character's wife were childhood sweethearts, but she couldn't even recognise that it was him when he aged back a few years...Even without the major plot holes, though, this movie is dreadful. I couldn't find an actual story anywhere, and I'm not exactly sure what the lead character learned or was supposed to learn about himself, after going back to his teen years. I certainly learned nothing from it, anyway.

The plot of this movie is fairly predictable and unoriginal, but that doesn't mean you won't find some entertainment here. The movie follows a man who has had his marriage fall apart transform into a younger version of himself where he rediscovers his love for his wife while getting closer to his kids (perhaps a little too close). Zac Efron does a good job playing a 40 year old in the body of a teenager. Although there is absolutely no way Efron could possibly grow up to look like that schlub Matthew Perry, give me a break. There are quite a few parts to this movie that feel very weird in hindsight. I don't need the scenes where the daughter wants to bone her dad. I also don't need the douchebag bully character to mention to Zac Efron that his daughter doesn't put out. Oh, thank God, I can finally rest easy knowing that Michelle Trachtenberg's character in this movie is a virgin. Also, I don't care how attractive you are, if you are a teenager who loudly advocates for abstinence during health class to all your peers, you just commit social suicide.

(Synopsis) In 1989, Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) is a high school senior and star athlete, who is heading for college on a basketball scholarship. But instead, Mike must give up his dreams, because his girlfriend Scarlett (played by Allison Miller - teenager) is pregnant. Twenty years have gone by and Mike is not living the good life. Mike must move in with his wealthy software genius nerd and best friend, Ned Freedman (Thomas Lennon), because he is separated from his wife Scarlett (played by Leslie Mann – adult). Mike has two teenage children, and he doesn't have a good relationship them either. At work, Mike has been passed over for another promotion again, because he doesn't have a college degree. Mike has hit rock bottom so he returns to his high school to reminisce his glory days. He shares his feelings with the school janitor how great things were when he was 17. On his way back to Ned's house, Mike is changed into a 17 year-old again. Mike returns to high school to finish the life he thought he should have had.(My Comment) The story is a 'what if' story of things that could have been. We don't know how life will treat us when we go down a different path. Where would I be if I had gone to college, joined the army, or not married Scarlet? But what people don't realize is that you only have one life, and you can never go back. You must live the life you have and make it better, if you can. If you want to change the world, make a change to your world, and you change the world. Mike realizes that he hasn't been a good father or husband. He discovers why he fell in love with Scarlet in the first place, and what he has missed by not being closer to his children. Mike already had a perfect life, he just didn't appreciate it. Zac Efron does a good job of making you believe that he is the father of his two children in the scenes he has with them. The storyline is predictable, and we have seen it before, but if you want to see a feel good movie that will keep the whole family entertained throughout, this is a good movie to see. It also has a moral to the story that you don't know what you have until you lose it. (New Line Cinema, Run Time 1:42, Rated PG-13)(7/10)

When I went and saw 17 Again and the film opened with Zac Efron in a basketball uniform shooting baskets for a minute I thought I was at High School Musical 4. But in fact it was not a bad comedy/drama in which Efron and Matthew Perry play the same character at different points of their lives.Back in 1989 Zac looked like he had it made, university scholarship for basketball in the offing when girl friend Allison Miller tells him she's pregnant. That takes his head out of the game real fast and the two of course get married.Fast forward to the present and the couple now played by Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann are split and she's filing for divorce. When a young girl who was probably bedding the boss at his job gets a promotion, that tears if for him. Perry makes a wish that he could be young again and have a second chance at life. A very strange janitor who is a guardian angel grants his wish and he's now Zac Efron again, this time in 2009.So like Joe Boyd who became Joe Hardy in Damn Yankees, Perry is now young and Zac Efron again. But he's also bringing 20 years of real life experience to high school and he becomes a guardian angel himself to his two children there, Michelle Trachtenberg and Sterling Knight.Although some compare 17 Again to It's A Wonderful Life, I think it stands better comparison to Damn Yankees and the Faust legend, except that it's a good angel and not the devil that's granting the wish. And of course his soul is no danger.Melora Hardin is around and playing the role of one of the foxiest school principals I've ever seen on film. She's the object of the affection of Thomas Lennon who was the school nerd and Efron's friend, like Screech Powers to Zack Morris. As a kid he's played by Tyler Steelman. Steelman was the school nerd then, but as an adult and Thomas Lennon he's a super rich guy, but still friends with the guy who protected him back in the day.I was expecting a teen sex comedy and I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised with how good 17 Again was. I highly recommend to audiences of all ages. And Zac Efron's fans of all ages.

I have to admit I wasn't aware of Zac Efron (or his fame) before I watched this movie. I knew Matthew Perry (from Friends), but Zac? Actually I think I'm still not fully aware what kind of an idol he might be to some teenagers at this moment. But it's not about the names. The movie itself is pretty good. You might have seen Leslie Mann before (not only because she's married to a great director), but she has to carry a pretty heavy role here.As do the others. There's themes here that might be borderline for those faint hearted types. But if you can't handle some pressure there, than you might not want to watch this. While this has been done in other similar fashions in movies (Big being one that comes in mind), this still is kinda good (haven't seen Big in a long time, so I can't really compare those movies). Nice teenage movies and a nice watch.

The idea for this film is hardly new. The notion of an adult becoming a teen once again or a teen becoming an adult or a teen going back in time and visiting their parents when they are teens--all are very, very familiar. Films like "Big", "Back to the Future", "Like Father Like Son" are just among the few examples of these sort of films. However, like I once heard a brilliant author say that "...there are only a limited number of plots--it's what you DO with the plot and characters that matters". And, she's right--not just because she's my wife!What I liked about "17 Again" is that it excels for two main reasons. First, the film is a bit irreverent and I loved the dialog. While parents might want to think twice about the film for younger kids, words like "douche" and "wiener" are the way kids really talk--I know, as I taught high school. Second, the supporting characters are really good--in particular, the friend of the time-traveling man, Ned is great. He's a wonderfully funny addition to the film and his antics alone make the film worth seeing.The plot finds Matthew Perry a lonely man whose life is falling apart. His wife wants a divorce and he has a terrible relationship with his kids. However, when a bizarre other-worldly janitor (Brian Doyle Murray) puts some sort of magical spell or curse on him, he suddenly become 17 once again. In this new role, he decides to go back to high school and help his kids. It seems that his son is a lonely wimp and his daughter is a bit of a tramp--dating the scum-bag that regularly beats up her brother!!Perry soon finds in his new guise as a 17 year-old (played by teen heart-throb Zac Efron), he's a lot more successful than he was as a father. He manages to be rather cool and a great teenager. He's able to help his son learn about his inner strength and skills--and joins the basketball team. The daughter, on the other hand, is a bit of a problem. She is a slut in training...but also thinks that Efron's attentions means he's great boyfriend material! And, to make things a lot worse, he and his soon to be ex-wife hit it off great...TOO GREAT. It's all rather creepy--but funny at the same time both daughter and mother head over heels in love with him! And, surprisingly, Efron handled the acting part of this quite well.Overall, the film manages to be both entertaining to teens (I watched it with my daughter and as a representative of every teen in America, she loved the film) and adults--my wife and I liked it. It's rare to find a film that is interesting and intelligently written enough to appeal to all age groups. Some parents may object to the language and the portion in the sex ed class, but I thought this was all handled appropriately and responsibly.Far better than I ever expected it could be.

I was invited to this movie by my Dad's girlfriend and since I wanted to be supportive, I came and hey...free movie. So as expected, me and my Dad were maybe 2 of 8 guys in a sea of teenage girls which was kind of embarrassing/hilarious. Anyway, 17 Again is mediocrity in its most boiled down form. The movie is about how Chandler Bing decides he hates his life now and is magically transformed into Zac Efron by Brian Doyle Murray as a corpulent janitor. Now mind you he doesn't go back in time...he's just 17 again in the same time. So he ends up going back to school and learning very important lessons regarding his family. Costarring Leslie Mann (who I love) as Chandler Bing's wife and Michelle Trachtenberg (who has a rockin' heinie), 17 Again features a couple good laughs, a predictable plot, and one particularly emotionally charged, well acted scene from Zac Efron. Basically, this movie could've been a lot better.

Me pushing the 'stop'-button on the DVD-player halfway through a movie doesn't happen a lot, but it happened this time. I was expecting to see an enjoyable and witty teen movie, nothing more, nothing less. But it wasn't enjoyable, nor was it witty.The acting was terrible, and the Ned-character was just downright annoying. I guess he was supposed to be the funny guy (which every teen movie has at least one of), but he was so NOT funny. I don't think I can blame the actor, it's probably just the absolutely rubbish script.These types of movies should be 'light', enjoyable and cleverly produced no-brainers, but even at this 17 Again failed big time. It's not worth buying the DVD, and watching it when it comes out on TV would also be a waste of your time. You'd better go dish washing or something. Honestly...

I've just returned from the cinema after watching this film and I have to say, my friends and I laughed like a bunch of hyenas (probably to the annoyance of anyone behind us) all the way through it. The story of course is nothing original, but you knew that going in, and yes, there are some seemingly ridiculous or stereotypical character setups, again acknowledged beforehand, but the direction and the acting, more than makes up for this. Most of the actors, especially Efron, who proves he's definitely not just a wanna-be pretty boy and actually stores away some talent, play their parts well. Matthew Perry seemed slightly misplaced, even if he was the reason I went to see the film in the first place. Not to mention the director being Burr Steers who directed one of my favourite films. I could kind of tell how in the wrong hands this movie could have been embarrassingly bad, but Steers manages to balance the right amount of comedy with drama and turn it into something really worth seeing. Efron blew me away. I have to say, I didn't see it coming, and I never thought I'd say such a sentence, but this boy can do better than TV Disney movies. I'm kind of glad he has turned down re-make, Footloose, not only because it's a 're-make of footloose'.On the negative side of things the writing lacked in terms of Mark's relationship with his daughter. The daughter didn't really seem to have a personality, now I'm not totally sure if this is down to Trachtenbergs terrible acting (one of very little who deliver poor performances actually) or poor character development but something was wrong there.I don't really rate the cinematography, but I don't think it's something to be taken quite seriously in teen films. It's all about the characters and the comedy - but what was up with that image of Zac right before 'Mark' falls into the water? Some interesting choices of music. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. Quite moving and Mark is a much more 3 dimensional, well developed character than most PG-13 rated movies you see. I genuinely cared about him, where as, even in Mean Girls, (which is particularly hilarious and legendary as far as contemporary teen films go) I didn't care too much for any of the characters. It's probably because this film went that little bit further than most and took itself seriously, if only for parts of the movie. It makes a big difference.So, yeah, '17 Again', fairly well written, hilarious, well and sometimes greatly acted and awesome direction for the most part, and a genuinely good, enjoyable and moving film. Take a look and you'll probably be surprised... but don't go in hoping for anything Oscar worthy. I get the impression there is only so much a director can do with a film like '17 Again' and he did it alright.Trustworthy director and impressive lead, I'd say. Can make all the difference.p.s. I'd also watch out for that Sterling Knight actor - he plays Marks awkward son. He gave a genuinely good performance also.

When i was going to see this film,i thought to myself that Zac Efrom was going to be all over this film showing off and all the girls in the cinema(which were about 95% of)would jump onto the screen and try and lick it.That wasn't the case at all.This film had been really funny and the star was of course Mr Efron himself.Efron's jokes were very well done and the way he handled himself around his family was fantastic.I would be the same thing if i went back to 17...although i am 15 right now.Matthew Perry was easily the lead in to efron,and he played it very well.Leslie's performance was a decent one.Michelle's was great at playing the horny,attitude,whatever teenage daughter.As for the loser son he was good as well as he turned from zero to hero.Overall this film had a cleaver story and quality acting that will make this film stand out as a comedy hit.

What has happened to Matthew Perry's career? That's, I'm assuming, the question on a lot of people's minds. The Friends alum had a total screen time of approximately 10 minutes or so, before relinquishing the spotlight to High School Musical refugee, Zac Efron. The Disney baby wisely jumped the East High ship before it completely submerged and has graduated to playing Mike O'Donnell, who apparently is supposed to resemble Matthew Perry as a teenager. No offense to Perry, but I seriously doubt that he looked anything like the swaggering, blue-eyed dynamo that is Zac Efron. Granted, the film still has a distinctly Disney stink to it, but none the less, I suppose it's not a bad film for Efron to further his movie career with. The makers of 17 Again certainly know their audience as Efron was shirtless within the first 30 seconds of the movie shooting hoops and, of course, drenched in sweat. By doing this, he's not exactly taking a giant step away from playing Troy Bolton (his HSM alter-ego) who lived his life with a basketball in his hand, but none the less, the sharp shooter is supposedly Mike O'Donnell when he was in high school. After discovering his girlfriend, Scarlett, was pregnant, he throws away his chances of going to college on a basketball scholarship and in a romantic leap, offers to marry Scarlett and take care of their child. Mike O'Donnell twenty years later, though, is an under-appreciated salesman who is living with his best friend Ned (a humorous Thomas Lennon) because he's divorcing his wife and mother of his two kids, Maggie and Alex (Michelle Trachtenberg and Sterling Knight). Apparently Mike's life is so unbearable that he, in a very cliché ridden exchange with a janitor during a walk through his old high school, laments that he wish he'd had it to "do all over again." In a markedly It's a Wonderful Life moment, Mike attempts to stop a man who looks as though he's about to commit suicide (surprise, it's the janitor from school!) and in turn, falls into a swirling vortex of terror that, when people fall into it, they turn into Zac Efron. Naturally, the first thing Mike does when he's his 17 year old self is throw on an Ed Hardy t-shirt and head straight back to high school. When he does, he discovers some not so savory things about his kids, as in, his daughter is dating the school bully and his son is the victim of some harassment involving being duct taped to a toilet. In the process of trying to turn his kids back in the right direction, Mike inadvertently makes his daughter fall in love with him (yuck) and skyrockets his son up the popularity food chain by helping him make the basketball team. He makes some incredibly inappropriate but misguided advances on adult Scarlett (Leslie Mann, who I can't imagine any guy wanting to divorce) but she wisely shoots him down on the basis that he is only a teenager. During his adventures as his teenage self, Mike discovers that he's been a lousy father and a bad husband. He also realizes exactly why he threw away his hoop dreams for Scarlett. (I won't give away the ending, but I promise, you can see it coming a mile away). There have been a whole lot of body-switching comedies in the history of cinema, and this one was no different in terms of the comedic style. Most of the laughs come from the awkwardness of a dad trying to act like a teenager, which has officially been dubbed (by me) lazy humor. Efron does what he can with the script (that was clearly written in three weeks considering how much the beginning and end were rushed) and he succeeds in nearly putting me and half of America into a good-looks induced coma. Leslie Mann is charming as usual, Thomas Lennon gets some laughs by playing the token nerdy guy, and Mike's children, Trachtenberg and Knight, have pleasant enough screen presences. Thanks to the skinny jeaned aficionado, Zac Efron, 17 Again is going to make a lot of money. Put a handsome enough guy into a lead role and people will basically see anything. 17 Again doesn't try to be what it's not (and I respect that) but then again, it also isn't much. It's littered with half-baked clichés and the storyline itself doesn't have nearly enough momentum to make it through a whole movie without crashing and burning. Basically, this movie will do an excellent job in feeding the masses of teenage girls (including myself) who will inevitably flock to this movie just to get a glimpse of their beloved shining star. My grade: C+

I'm starting to suspect that Hollywood no longer uses actual, human screenwriters to create their movies. After watching years of the same, recycled trash, I'm starting to think that they now use a screenplay-writing machine to do it. This machine works very simply. A producer will enter the main character's name, one problem they are facing, and one 'gimmick' (an unusual plot twist often used as a selling point for the film), and hey presto! - out pops a completed, and entirely unoriginal screenplay. Such is the case for 17 Again. Mike O'Donnell is a depressed suburban father (sounds familiar already, doesn't it?) whose wife is divorcing him, kids can't stand him, and who just got passed over for a promotion. As the movie progressed, it started to seem very, very familiar - a crippling combination of unoriginal jokes, stereotypical characters and recycled plot devices. My friends and I started to grin and sneeringly guess what was going to happen later in the film, and guess what: most of the time, we were right.We've all seen this movie before - it's been pieced together from the discarded carcasses of films past, by a flock of vultures seemingly so unaccustomed to originality in film-making that they have been rendered unable to create any plot twist even slightly unexpected or interesting. And don't even get me started on Zac Efron's acting (or lack of such).Two small good things. Out of the dozens of jokes thrown at us, a select few - maybe five - were genuinely hilarious. Other than that, though, the humor relied on the the faux-improvised, overly-awkward style of comedy popularized by Seth Rogen and co. It doesn't work here. The other highlight, of course, was Matthew Perry. He's the man, and an excellent comic actor, but his short on-screen time was not enough to salvage this unoriginal, unfunny, and worst of all boring attempt at light entertainment. Perhaps if the film had eliminated the dramatic aspects and stuck to being a comedy, it could have succeeded, but this is one movie I certainly would not want to see again.

-Typical American Comedy Without Big Claims.

In 1989, the teenager Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) is the star of the Hayden High-School. On the day of the final basketball game, Mike will be observed and may win a scholarship in college. However, his girlfriend Scarlett (Allison Miller) tells him that she is pregnant and Mike does not play the game. Twenty years later, Mike (Matthew Perry) is a complete loser that blames Scar for his failures: he is not promoted to sale manager after working sixteen years in the same company; Scarlett (Leslie Mann) is divorcing him; his teenagers son Alex (Sterling Knight) and daughter Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) hate him; and he is temporarily living with his best friend, the eccentric and immature millionaire Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon). Mike nostalgically visits Hayden where an old janitor talks to him about second chance in life. During the night, he sees the janitor jumping from a bridge into the river and he unsuccessfully tries to help the man. Mike passes out and when he wakes up, he discovers that he is seventeen again. Further, he discovers that he has a second chance to fix his relationship with his family."17 Again" is another good movie about second chance in life. I believe most of people in a certain age question decisions took in the past and would like to have a second chance to re-route his or her life in that milestone. The cinema makes this dream come true and certainly the story is pleasant for most of the people. In addition, the two lead stars (Zac Efron and Matthew Perry) are nice actors and the result is a nice entertainment for whole family. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "17 Outra Vez" ("17 Again")

As we've seen many movies like this before: Big, 13 Going on 30, and Freaky Friday, we always love to see the retelling of the old classic story of the switching age. Since the story has been used so much, a director can only do so much to just do the best they can with, Burr Steers pulls 17 Again out with great laughs and good fun. I'm going to get this out, I am one of the rare girls that just doesn't get the whole Zac Efron heart throb thing, I agree that he's cute, but with mainly High School Musical only being his claim to fame other than Hairspray, he is adorable, but can he act? Surprisingly he can. I can't believe I'm saying this, he was actually a good strong lead role and a perfect fit, he has charisma, he's funny, charming and makes this story worth your time and money.In 1989, Michael O'Donnell was a star athlete with a full college scholarship imminent. He seemingly had it all, when, right before the championship game, his girlfriend Scarlett informed him she was pregnant. In that moment, he made the decision to throw everything away and proposed to her. Twenty years later, Mike's life isn't exactly what he expected it to be. Scarlett wants a divorce from him, forcing him to move in with his geeky millionaire best friend Ned, his job is going nowhere, and his kids Maggie and Alex want nothing to do with him. While paying a visit to Hayden High School to reminisce about the life he threw away, he encounters a strange beardy janitor, who I still swear is Bob Haskins. On the way home, is magically transformed back into his 17-year old self. With Ned posing as his father, he re-enrolls in high school, believing he has been given the chance to have his life over again, "but to do it right". However, he then discovers that his daughter is dating the basketball captain Stan, who is bullying his son. He realizes that his real mission is to help his children as well as finding out that maybe his decision wasn't the worst he ever made in his life.We go a little Back to the Future-esquire when we get on the creepy level of Michelle Trachtenberg having a crush on Zac Efron who is her father, just that she can't recognize him, it's understanding, but still makes you squirm, but the director and actors pulled the scene off pretty well with getting out of that yucky situation. There is one continuity error: if Mike and his girl got pregnant at the age of 17... 20 years later, yet both their kids are still in high school, the oldest child would only be a maximum of 18. A plot hole: seriously, besides the wife, no one at all recognizes Mike? But I'm over thinking the movie too much at this point, it's just a fun movie with decent performances, I just need to let go of silly mistakes. So I would recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, but I'd say more of a matinée vs. a full price ticket, it has some good laughs and was a great update of the "What if you could go back?" story.7/10

I went to see this with film with my teenage daughter and really wasn't expecting to enjoy it. I settled down in my seat for the duration and the first few scenes showing Efron as a high school basketball player had me groaning inwardly as I assumed that this was going to be another predictable high school/age swap film of the type that has been done so many times before - and really isn't the sort of film I would choose to see anyway. Not a promising start. However, I was pleasantly surprised by 17 Again. It was witty and well acted and made me laugh out loud - not something I often do even when I appreciate the humour in a film.This film's appeal is also strengthened by the acting of the supporting characters as well as the main ones - Thomas Lennon's character was particularly well delivered. I found no fault with Zac Efron's acting in this and I enjoyed his performance in Hairspray but it would be interesting to see him in a serious grown up dramatic role.

Every teen generation needs a good body swap/turn the clock back type of story and 17 again is one of those stories, Mike O'Donnell had it all. He was the star of his high schools basket ball team. He had Scarlet the most beautiful girl in the school as his girlfriend. Right before the game that could make him into a star, Scarlet tells Mike she's pregnant, Mike makes a drastic and life altering decision and runs out of the game to be with her giving up his chances of becoming a basket ball star, now 20 years later Mike's regretting it all and wishes he could do it all over again, and by some miraculous way he does.17 again is a cool and stylish what if movie, it brings to light the question of what if you could change your life, if you could live it all over again.What would you do different? That's the question this movie propose and tells with a grand lush style that resonates with the teen population and even with the adults too, 17 again is not just some teen movie, it's a movie that even adults between the ages of 30-50 would enjoy it, my dad sure did. But this film has it's flaws and some very minor bad dialogue from Zack Efron but nothing that would hamper this films style or production, but in my honest opinion this film was very good, this movie is not Oscar worthy but it's definitely worth the price of admission.

Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) was a teen basketball jock with all the potential in the world. When his girlfriend got pregnant, he abandons it all to marry her. Now they're adults, Mike (Matthew Perry) can't stop blaming all his problems on this decision. His wife Scarlet (Leslie Mann) divorces him. Then one night, a guardian angel sends Mike through a vortex and turns him back into a teen again. He decides to go back to high school to relive his high school years, but instead he reconnects with his family.Thomas Lennon does his wacky best friend. It's basically 'Big' in reverse. The story isn't anything new or original. Zac Efron is quite funny as the fish out of water. He's surprisingly great as a compelling lead. It's his performance and his energy that drives this movie. The trick is that he's not playing a teen. He's playing mid-30s in a body of a teen.

I didn't think I would like this movie and yet I actually really did! First thing that makes one feel a bit reluctant about this movie is the fact that we saw this story hundreds of time. The going back in time/being a teen again stories are very popular. And yes, this one is another of them. Main reason I can't rate it is higher than 7 is because it lacks originality and it is easy to predict what happens and how it ends.Yet, this does not ruin the movie. It has a fresh and funny dialogue and an amazing cast.Actually I would like to apologize to Zac Effron. I never saw a movie with him before and only knew that he is loved by teenage girls. So when I started watching I was ind of resenting the idea that soon Mathew Perry, who is a funny actor, will be replaced by Zac Effron for the most of the movie. Yet, it didn't turn out as a bad thing. He is actually a very good and funny actor. Next time I see that he is in the cast, I will consider it a positive thing.The rest of the cast was great as well, a special mentioning deserves Thomas Lennon whose character Ned made me laugh through the movie.It is a very PG movie. I was very happy about the fact that they didn't make it too cheesy. It had its moments but for the most it is just light entertainment. I am not even the target audience, I think for the most it is appealing to teenagers or parents who miss their school days. I am neither and yet I liked it,so its a well done job.

This is another movie I watched with my friend who works at a movie theatre. With elements of Big and 13 Going on 30, not to mention It's a Wonderful Life and Back to the Future, 17 Again is a pretty enjoyable meshing of those movies considering the cast which has Zac Efron, Michelle Trachtenberg, Leslie Mann, Margaret Cho, Thomas Lennon, and Melora Hardin. I also recognized Matthew Perry and Nicole Sullivan. I did not realize until the cast credits that the bearded janitor at the high school was Brian Doyle-Murray, Bill's brother. Now, parts of the plot and characterizations were a little uneven but despite that there were plenty of scenes that were hilarious especially those between Lennon and Hardin. With them, I also saw a little "Big Bang Theory" vibe. Oh, and there's a little touching pro-abstinence speech here as well (though it still is acknowledged that not all teens will feel that way). All in all, despite some adult humor, 17 Again was an enjoyable comedy that should be enjoyable enough for parents and offspring alike. Oh, and one more thing: I thought the Vanilla Ice reference in the 1989 sequence didn't fit since I remember him not even emerging until the following year...

Why does this movie have only a six? Is it because of Efron? I thought this movie was just smart and not lacking in any way. The script was hilarious and had a full good plot line, the casting was great (Zac Efron really made you believe he was married with children... looking 17!) and even the smaller roles were really great additions. I've seen this movie thrice and trust me, it's not just for Efron (which I assume is why people are hating on it - stop the bias!), it's genuinely well written, directed, acted... etc. Brilliant! Will see again... 17 Again.

I have to admit I am not a big fan of Zac Efron, but I saw 17 Again expecting to hate it but actually it wasn't that bad. Yes, the story is predictable, yes the pacing is uneven and yes the ending is a bit of a letdown.However, there are a lot of redeeming merits. The soundtrack is excellent, and the script is surprisingly decent with just the right amount of quirky humour. The direction is good, while the acting is not bad at all. The characters are a little clichéd admittedly, but the actors do their best to make the most of their characters. Zac Efron gives a great performance in the lead and fits perfectly with the film's tone. Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann are both good too, but it is Efron's film all the way.Overall, not bad actually quite enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox

I truly have become more convinced that Hollywood has been bankrupt of good ideas or good filmmakers who are in touch with what the audience really want to see. Boring, unimaginative, and completely lacking of good film-making. This film clearly show a complete lack of passion and vision. It imitates what others have so brilliantly forged but still falls flat. Burr Steers? Can someone say the emperor has no clothes? I would have loved to have been sitting in that studio/executive's office during the pitch for this concept. Why were they not thrown out on their behind, I will never know. What do they expect when they start with a very lame script, and then hire a completely inadequate director, Burr Steers, who does not know the craft if it were fed to him with a silver spoon. But wait, I think that is exactly how he got his job...not his skill but his inner connections. The agent for Zac should be fired for choosing such a vehicle to launch his rise into a leading man. Burr steers should never go near comedy again or even near film-making in general.

The storyline was very well done and enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. Keep an open mind and you will enjoy the movie.Zac Efron did a really decent acting job. I honestly thought it would be High School Musical-like but it turned out to be a nice movie to watch. If he keeps up the good work and takes it to the next level, he can really be an A level quality star. Zac is no Matthew Macfadden yet but there is potential.There are two recasts I would have done. Matthew Perry wasn't fully right for this role. He has a comedic bent but it wasn't used at all in this movie - hence a total waste and was a mismatch from a character perspective. I think John Stamos would have been better. Also Michelle Trachtenberg playing the teenager was a bit much. Trachtenberg is a solid actress but for a teenager, a different actress would have been better.It is a very nice movie and I usually rate a movie on whether it's worth paying full price, matinée, video store, Netflix or don't bother. The movie was worth paying full price.

The plot of this movie is fairly predictable and unoriginal, but that doesn't mean you won't find some entertainment here. The movie follows a man who has had his marriage fall apart transform into a younger version of himself where he rediscovers his love for his wife while getting closer to his kids (perhaps a little too close). Zac Efron does a good job playing a 40 year old in the body of a teenager. Although there is absolutely no way Efron could possibly grow up to look like that schlub Matthew Perry, give me a break. There are quite a few parts to this movie that feel very weird in hindsight. I don't need the scenes where the daughter wants to bone her dad. I also don't need the douchebag bully character to mention to Zac Efron that his daughter doesn't put out. Oh, thank God, I can finally rest easy knowing that Michelle Trachtenberg's character in this movie is a virgin. Also, I don't care how attractive you are, if you are a teenager who loudly advocates for abstinence during health class to all your peers, you just commit social suicide.

Maybe it's just because I'm not really into these teen romance movies, but I really wasn't impressed. If I'm honest, I was actually expecting it to be mildly entertaining. Entertaining in a bad way, but still entertaining. However, it wasn't even that.The only parts of the movie that I actually enjoyed were Efron's sudden change into Perry, and Efron's character's wife failing to recognise him, after he became '17 again'. I found it quite remarkable that ones appearance can be changed so dramatically after ageing a couple of decades. What was almost as incredible is the fact that Efron and his character's wife were childhood sweethearts, but she couldn't even recognise that it was him when he aged back a few years...Even without the major plot holes, though, this movie is dreadful. I couldn't find an actual story anywhere, and I'm not exactly sure what the lead character learned or was supposed to learn about himself, after going back to his teen years. I certainly learned nothing from it, anyway.

Matthew Perry has had an up an down film career but this isn't through lack of effort. The main problem is that in many of his films (which don't get me wrong I really like) he plays a character too similar to his character on the hit sitcom Friends. However here he is takes on a role I doubt anyone could have predicted and does very well in the limited screen time he had. Sure there are flashes of Chandler here but by and large it is a different type of character. This is obviously a vehicle for Zac Efron and everything in this film is centred around him because of this. He proves in 17 again that he can be more than just that kid from High School Musical and can actually act. He is ably supported by Leslie Mann and Thomas Lennon and overall this film is light, funny and entertaining and at times heart warming film that Matthew Perry is a big part of. of this.

(Synopsis) In 1989, Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) is a high school senior and star athlete, who is heading for college on a basketball scholarship. But instead, Mike must give up his dreams, because his girlfriend Scarlett (played by Allison Miller - teenager) is pregnant. Twenty years have gone by and Mike is not living the good life. Mike must move in with his wealthy software genius nerd and best friend, Ned Freedman (Thomas Lennon), because he is separated from his wife Scarlett (played by Leslie Mann – adult). Mike has two teenage children, and he doesn't have a good relationship them either. At work, Mike has been passed over for another promotion again, because he doesn't have a college degree. Mike has hit rock bottom so he returns to his high school to reminisce his glory days. He shares his feelings with the school janitor how great things were when he was 17. On his way back to Ned's house, Mike is changed into a 17 year-old again. Mike returns to high school to finish the life he thought he should have had.(My Comment) The story is a 'what if' story of things that could have been. We don't know how life will treat us when we go down a different path. Where would I be if I had gone to college, joined the army, or not married Scarlet? But what people don't realize is that you only have one life, and you can never go back. You must live the life you have and make it better, if you can. If you want to change the world, make a change to your world, and you change the world. Mike realizes that he hasn't been a good father or husband. He discovers why he fell in love with Scarlet in the first place, and what he has missed by not being closer to his children. Mike already had a perfect life, he just didn't appreciate it. Zac Efron does a good job of making you believe that he is the father of his two children in the scenes he has with them. The storyline is predictable, and we have seen it before, but if you want to see a feel good movie that will keep the whole family entertained throughout, this is a good movie to see. It also has a moral to the story that you don't know what you have until you lose it. (New Line Cinema, Run Time 1:42, Rated PG-13)(7/10)

When I went and saw 17 Again and the film opened with Zac Efron in a basketball uniform shooting baskets for a minute I thought I was at High School Musical 4. But in fact it was not a bad comedy/drama in which Efron and Matthew Perry play the same character at different points of their lives.Back in 1989 Zac looked like he had it made, university scholarship for basketball in the offing when girl friend Allison Miller tells him she's pregnant. That takes his head out of the game real fast and the two of course get married.Fast forward to the present and the couple now played by Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann are split and she's filing for divorce. When a young girl who was probably bedding the boss at his job gets a promotion, that tears if for him. Perry makes a wish that he could be young again and have a second chance at life. A very strange janitor who is a guardian angel grants his wish and he's now Zac Efron again, this time in 2009.So like Joe Boyd who became Joe Hardy in Damn Yankees, Perry is now young and Zac Efron again. But he's also bringing 20 years of real life experience to high school and he becomes a guardian angel himself to his two children there, Michelle Trachtenberg and Sterling Knight.Although some compare 17 Again to It's A Wonderful Life, I think it stands better comparison to Damn Yankees and the Faust legend, except that it's a good angel and not the devil that's granting the wish. And of course his soul is no danger.Melora Hardin is around and playing the role of one of the foxiest school principals I've ever seen on film. She's the object of the affection of Thomas Lennon who was the school nerd and Efron's friend, like Screech Powers to Zack Morris. As a kid he's played by Tyler Steelman. Steelman was the school nerd then, but as an adult and Thomas Lennon he's a super rich guy, but still friends with the guy who protected him back in the day.I was expecting a teen sex comedy and I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised with how good 17 Again was. I highly recommend to audiences of all ages. And Zac Efron's fans of all ages.

I have to admit I wasn't aware of Zac Efron (or his fame) before I watched this movie. I knew Matthew Perry (from Friends), but Zac? Actually I think I'm still not fully aware what kind of an idol he might be to some teenagers at this moment. But it's not about the names. The movie itself is pretty good. You might have seen Leslie Mann before (not only because she's married to a great director), but she has to carry a pretty heavy role here.As do the others. There's themes here that might be borderline for those faint hearted types. But if you can't handle some pressure there, than you might not want to watch this. While this has been done in other similar fashions in movies (Big being one that comes in mind), this still is kinda good (haven't seen Big in a long time, so I can't really compare those movies). Nice teenage movies and a nice watch.

The idea for this film is hardly new. The notion of an adult becoming a teen once again or a teen becoming an adult or a teen going back in time and visiting their parents when they are teens--all are very, very familiar. Films like "Big", "Back to the Future", "Like Father Like Son" are just among the few examples of these sort of films. However, like I once heard a brilliant author say that "...there are only a limited number of plots--it's what you DO with the plot and characters that matters". And, she's right--not just because she's my wife!What I liked about "17 Again" is that it excels for two main reasons. First, the film is a bit irreverent and I loved the dialog. While parents might want to think twice about the film for younger kids, words like "douche" and "wiener" are the way kids really talk--I know, as I taught high school. Second, the supporting characters are really good--in particular, the friend of the time-traveling man, Ned is great. He's a wonderfully funny addition to the film and his antics alone make the film worth seeing.The plot finds Matthew Perry a lonely man whose life is falling apart. His wife wants a divorce and he has a terrible relationship with his kids. However, when a bizarre other-worldly janitor (Brian Doyle Murray) puts some sort of magical spell or curse on him, he suddenly become 17 once again. In this new role, he decides to go back to high school and help his kids. It seems that his son is a lonely wimp and his daughter is a bit of a tramp--dating the scum-bag that regularly beats up her brother!!Perry soon finds in his new guise as a 17 year-old (played by teen heart-throb Zac Efron), he's a lot more successful than he was as a father. He manages to be rather cool and a great teenager. He's able to help his son learn about his inner strength and skills--and joins the basketball team. The daughter, on the other hand, is a bit of a problem. She is a slut in training...but also thinks that Efron's attentions means he's great boyfriend material! And, to make things a lot worse, he and his soon to be ex-wife hit it off great...TOO GREAT. It's all rather creepy--but funny at the same time both daughter and mother head over heels in love with him! And, surprisingly, Efron handled the acting part of this quite well.Overall, the film manages to be both entertaining to teens (I watched it with my daughter and as a representative of every teen in America, she loved the film) and adults--my wife and I liked it. It's rare to find a film that is interesting and intelligently written enough to appeal to all age groups. Some parents may object to the language and the portion in the sex ed class, but I thought this was all handled appropriately and responsibly.Far better than I ever expected it could be.

I was invited to this movie by my Dad's girlfriend and since I wanted to be supportive, I came and hey...free movie. So as expected, me and my Dad were maybe 2 of 8 guys in a sea of teenage girls which was kind of embarrassing/hilarious. Anyway, 17 Again is mediocrity in its most boiled down form. The movie is about how Chandler Bing decides he hates his life now and is magically transformed into Zac Efron by Brian Doyle Murray as a corpulent janitor. Now mind you he doesn't go back in time...he's just 17 again in the same time. So he ends up going back to school and learning very important lessons regarding his family. Costarring Leslie Mann (who I love) as Chandler Bing's wife and Michelle Trachtenberg (who has a rockin' heinie), 17 Again features a couple good laughs, a predictable plot, and one particularly emotionally charged, well acted scene from Zac Efron. Basically, this movie could've been a lot better.

Me pushing the 'stop'-button on the DVD-player halfway through a movie doesn't happen a lot, but it happened this time. I was expecting to see an enjoyable and witty teen movie, nothing more, nothing less. But it wasn't enjoyable, nor was it witty.The acting was terrible, and the Ned-character was just downright annoying. I guess he was supposed to be the funny guy (which every teen movie has at least one of), but he was so NOT funny. I don't think I can blame the actor, it's probably just the absolutely rubbish script.These types of movies should be 'light', enjoyable and cleverly produced no-brainers, but even at this 17 Again failed big time. It's not worth buying the DVD, and watching it when it comes out on TV would also be a waste of your time. You'd better go dish washing or something. Honestly...

I've just returned from the cinema after watching this film and I have to say, my friends and I laughed like a bunch of hyenas (probably to the annoyance of anyone behind us) all the way through it. The story of course is nothing original, but you knew that going in, and yes, there are some seemingly ridiculous or stereotypical character setups, again acknowledged beforehand, but the direction and the acting, more than makes up for this. Most of the actors, especially Efron, who proves he's definitely not just a wanna-be pretty boy and actually stores away some talent, play their parts well. Matthew Perry seemed slightly misplaced, even if he was the reason I went to see the film in the first place. Not to mention the director being Burr Steers who directed one of my favourite films. I could kind of tell how in the wrong hands this movie could have been embarrassingly bad, but Steers manages to balance the right amount of comedy with drama and turn it into something really worth seeing. Efron blew me away. I have to say, I didn't see it coming, and I never thought I'd say such a sentence, but this boy can do better than TV Disney movies. I'm kind of glad he has turned down re-make, Footloose, not only because it's a 're-make of footloose'.On the negative side of things the writing lacked in terms of Mark's relationship with his daughter. The daughter didn't really seem to have a personality, now I'm not totally sure if this is down to Trachtenbergs terrible acting (one of very little who deliver poor performances actually) or poor character development but something was wrong there.I don't really rate the cinematography, but I don't think it's something to be taken quite seriously in teen films. It's all about the characters and the comedy - but what was up with that image of Zac right before 'Mark' falls into the water? Some interesting choices of music. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. Quite moving and Mark is a much more 3 dimensional, well developed character than most PG-13 rated movies you see. I genuinely cared about him, where as, even in Mean Girls, (which is particularly hilarious and legendary as far as contemporary teen films go) I didn't care too much for any of the characters. It's probably because this film went that little bit further than most and took itself seriously, if only for parts of the movie. It makes a big difference.So, yeah, '17 Again', fairly well written, hilarious, well and sometimes greatly acted and awesome direction for the most part, and a genuinely good, enjoyable and moving film. Take a look and you'll probably be surprised... but don't go in hoping for anything Oscar worthy. I get the impression there is only so much a director can do with a film like '17 Again' and he did it alright.Trustworthy director and impressive lead, I'd say. Can make all the difference.p.s. I'd also watch out for that Sterling Knight actor - he plays Marks awkward son. He gave a genuinely good performance also.

When i was going to see this film,i thought to myself that Zac Efrom was going to be all over this film showing off and all the girls in the cinema(which were about 95% of)would jump onto the screen and try and lick it.That wasn't the case at all.This film had been really funny and the star was of course Mr Efron himself.Efron's jokes were very well done and the way he handled himself around his family was fantastic.I would be the same thing if i went back to 17...although i am 15 right now.Matthew Perry was easily the lead in to efron,and he played it very well.Leslie's performance was a decent one.Michelle's was great at playing the horny,attitude,whatever teenage daughter.As for the loser son he was good as well as he turned from zero to hero.Overall this film had a cleaver story and quality acting that will make this film stand out as a comedy hit.

What has happened to Matthew Perry's career? That's, I'm assuming, the question on a lot of people's minds. The Friends alum had a total screen time of approximately 10 minutes or so, before relinquishing the spotlight to High School Musical refugee, Zac Efron. The Disney baby wisely jumped the East High ship before it completely submerged and has graduated to playing Mike O'Donnell, who apparently is supposed to resemble Matthew Perry as a teenager. No offense to Perry, but I seriously doubt that he looked anything like the swaggering, blue-eyed dynamo that is Zac Efron. Granted, the film still has a distinctly Disney stink to it, but none the less, I suppose it's not a bad film for Efron to further his movie career with. The makers of 17 Again certainly know their audience as Efron was shirtless within the first 30 seconds of the movie shooting hoops and, of course, drenched in sweat. By doing this, he's not exactly taking a giant step away from playing Troy Bolton (his HSM alter-ego) who lived his life with a basketball in his hand, but none the less, the sharp shooter is supposedly Mike O'Donnell when he was in high school. After discovering his girlfriend, Scarlett, was pregnant, he throws away his chances of going to college on a basketball scholarship and in a romantic leap, offers to marry Scarlett and take care of their child. Mike O'Donnell twenty years later, though, is an under-appreciated salesman who is living with his best friend Ned (a humorous Thomas Lennon) because he's divorcing his wife and mother of his two kids, Maggie and Alex (Michelle Trachtenberg and Sterling Knight). Apparently Mike's life is so unbearable that he, in a very cliché ridden exchange with a janitor during a walk through his old high school, laments that he wish he'd had it to "do all over again." In a markedly It's a Wonderful Life moment, Mike attempts to stop a man who looks as though he's about to commit suicide (surprise, it's the janitor from school!) and in turn, falls into a swirling vortex of terror that, when people fall into it, they turn into Zac Efron. Naturally, the first thing Mike does when he's his 17 year old self is throw on an Ed Hardy t-shirt and head straight back to high school. When he does, he discovers some not so savory things about his kids, as in, his daughter is dating the school bully and his son is the victim of some harassment involving being duct taped to a toilet. In the process of trying to turn his kids back in the right direction, Mike inadvertently makes his daughter fall in love with him (yuck) and skyrockets his son up the popularity food chain by helping him make the basketball team. He makes some incredibly inappropriate but misguided advances on adult Scarlett (Leslie Mann, who I can't imagine any guy wanting to divorce) but she wisely shoots him down on the basis that he is only a teenager. During his adventures as his teenage self, Mike discovers that he's been a lousy father and a bad husband. He also realizes exactly why he threw away his hoop dreams for Scarlett. (I won't give away the ending, but I promise, you can see it coming a mile away). There have been a whole lot of body-switching comedies in the history of cinema, and this one was no different in terms of the comedic style. Most of the laughs come from the awkwardness of a dad trying to act like a teenager, which has officially been dubbed (by me) lazy humor. Efron does what he can with the script (that was clearly written in three weeks considering how much the beginning and end were rushed) and he succeeds in nearly putting me and half of America into a good-looks induced coma. Leslie Mann is charming as usual, Thomas Lennon gets some laughs by playing the token nerdy guy, and Mike's children, Trachtenberg and Knight, have pleasant enough screen presences. Thanks to the skinny jeaned aficionado, Zac Efron, 17 Again is going to make a lot of money. Put a handsome enough guy into a lead role and people will basically see anything. 17 Again doesn't try to be what it's not (and I respect that) but then again, it also isn't much. It's littered with half-baked clichés and the storyline itself doesn't have nearly enough momentum to make it through a whole movie without crashing and burning. Basically, this movie will do an excellent job in feeding the masses of teenage girls (including myself) who will inevitably flock to this movie just to get a glimpse of their beloved shining star. My grade: C+

I'm starting to suspect that Hollywood no longer uses actual, human screenwriters to create their movies. After watching years of the same, recycled trash, I'm starting to think that they now use a screenplay-writing machine to do it. This machine works very simply. A producer will enter the main character's name, one problem they are facing, and one 'gimmick' (an unusual plot twist often used as a selling point for the film), and hey presto! - out pops a completed, and entirely unoriginal screenplay. Such is the case for 17 Again. Mike O'Donnell is a depressed suburban father (sounds familiar already, doesn't it?) whose wife is divorcing him, kids can't stand him, and who just got passed over for a promotion. As the movie progressed, it started to seem very, very familiar - a crippling combination of unoriginal jokes, stereotypical characters and recycled plot devices. My friends and I started to grin and sneeringly guess what was going to happen later in the film, and guess what: most of the time, we were right.We've all seen this movie before - it's been pieced together from the discarded carcasses of films past, by a flock of vultures seemingly so unaccustomed to originality in film-making that they have been rendered unable to create any plot twist even slightly unexpected or interesting. And don't even get me started on Zac Efron's acting (or lack of such).Two small good things. Out of the dozens of jokes thrown at us, a select few - maybe five - were genuinely hilarious. Other than that, though, the humor relied on the the faux-improvised, overly-awkward style of comedy popularized by Seth Rogen and co. It doesn't work here. The other highlight, of course, was Matthew Perry. He's the man, and an excellent comic actor, but his short on-screen time was not enough to salvage this unoriginal, unfunny, and worst of all boring attempt at light entertainment. Perhaps if the film had eliminated the dramatic aspects and stuck to being a comedy, it could have succeeded, but this is one movie I certainly would not want to see again.
