"Click" is a interesting film hybrid of comedy, drama and some science fiction with adam sandler and somehow it worked.most adam sandler films tends to the dumb-comedy crowd with he's very old 90's comedy shtick that "Billy Madison" and "Happy Gilmore" started but repeated many times later which give sandler the negative reputation since, but then he give a mature performances in "Punch-Drunk Love", "The Longest Yard", "Reign Over Me" and even "Funny People" he can do drama and be believable without force comedy along with his annoying voice.Click is more or less sci-fi retailing of "it's a wonderful life" about an workaholic architect who has slow-life with his family and getting problems from his boss, after some shopping he discovers by a mysterious person a special remote control which he can skip time (fast forward) and change things in the present (Pause or Mute), at first he's enjoys it's advantages, but slowly it controls his workaholic life, destroying his marriage, relationship with his children and he's family. the film has few comedic moment early-on but their are very sandler standers, but when it get emotional and dramatic it make the film more than just another dumb-comedy.the scene where adam sandler's character finds out that his father died it's probably the saddest heart-breaking scene i have ever seen in a film that's how much family is important. Henry Winkler who playing the father gives an excellent performance very strong and emotional.

It's not the typical Adam Sandler movie and thank goodness for that. This movie has some actual drama, some real heart to it. It's not all lowbrow toilet humor. Has Adam Sandler grown up? Even in this more grownup venture he apparently just couldn't help himself, tossing in the obligatory disgusting fart joke. But we'll give him a a pass on that one because pretty much everything else in the movie shows a refreshing maturity. Well, OK maybe not the humping dogs. But what do you want? Sandler's never going to go full-blown serious dramatist and who'd want him to? This movie maintains the humor Sandler is known for but also gives you a story you actually care about and moments of great emotion and poignancy. Along the way Sandler gets to show that he does have some actual serious acting chops. One scene with him and his father, played by Henry Winkler, particularly stands out. Here Sandler's character has so much emotion coursing through him. And Sandler performs the scene so well you feel the emotion right along with him. Very well done, and more than a little surprising from an actor who is not known for this sort of thing.The story revolves around Sandler's character of Michael, an overworked architect whose family takes a backseat in his quest for career advancement. He loves his family, he just doesn't have the time for them. Then he meets Morty, a mysterious man who bestows upon Michael a gift which will make things so much simpler. It's a universal remote which actually control's Michael's universe. Now he's got all the time he needs. He can pause, rewind, fast forward. But inevitably there will be complications. Michael ends up fast forwarding through his whole life. He misses everything. And he gets really, really fat. It seems in order to really appreciate life Michael had to miss it. Can he get it back? According to Morty that's not part of the deal.Those expecting a straight comedy are going to be very surprised with Click, but probably pleasantly so. There are plenty of laughs but nothing that's really uproariously funny. And most of the comedy is shoehorned into the first half of the film. The second half takes on a more serious, at times even somber, tone. A somber Adam Sandler movie? Who wants to watch that? You should. Sandler breaks out of the little box that is his admittedly wildly successful career to try something a little bit different and it pays off. Sandler is really terrific in this. And he's got great support from the rest of the cast, most notably the always reliably brilliant Christopher Walken playing the eccentric Morty. Not everything in the movie works perfectly. Some jokes fall flat, some dramatic moments don't grab you quite as much as they should. But most of it works, and works very well at that. Adam Sandler can make you laugh. Turns out he can tug on your heartstrings too. Who knew?

Only a 10 can be given to this monumental art piece that changed cinema forever.

Michael (Adam Sandler) has a gorgeous wife and the proverbial two kids. He is an architect employed by a tedious boss and Micheal must work extra hours to bring home enough bacon. One day when his own children tease him for mixing up the remote controls, he decides to take action. He will run out and get a universal remote, like the snotty rich neighbors. However, it is rather late at night and the only store open is Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Nevertheless, in the Beyond section of the store, an unusual clerk sells him the ultimate universal remote, one that is free and non-returnable, too. Michael happily returns home. But, wait. Michael soon finds out THIS remote can also stop the dog from barking loudly and fast forward him through a shower or an argument with his wife. Great, is it not? All too soon, Michael learns that the remote has a down side, including missing important moments in his life. And, although he tries, the remote can not be discarded. Help! This is movie that has some funny moments and some good ideas but it's not enough. Sandler has never tried harder to make things work and to keep laughs coming but he ultimately fails. Perhaps this is because of some very tasteless humor when things go awry. Beckingsale is quite wonderful, however, as the much put-upon wife. Walken is always topnotch and it is wonderful to see Winkler and Kavner. With such a cast, one would guess the movie can't miss, but is does. The culprits are probably the so-so script and the uneven direction. In any case, even if you are a Sandler die-hard, you will be left out in the cold by this film. You may even want to click your own remote and fast forward to the end of the film long before the movie's ending.

Michael Newman has it all; a gorgeous wife that really loves him, two beautiful kids, a great home and a job he does well. Still he is not entirely satisfied with how his career is progressing and resents spending time away from big projects that might further him in the company.One night in a Bed Bath and Beyond, while looking for a universal remote for his TV, Michael runs into a guy named Morty. Morty is a bit odd, but gives Micheal the remote. Instead of being meant for a TV, this remote controls your life. Soon Michael is skipping life events that he dislikes and tries to only be present for the good parts.Before Michael understands what he has unleashed he is an old man, dying in a hospital and alone. Can he correct the error or his ways before he dies?Every damn time I watch this I cry. Why? Because it is so damn relatable. How many of us as kids could not wait to go to school? Then graduate so we can be adults and "do whatever we want"? Then as adults, how many of us wish the work week would fly by, etc, etc, etc? Before you know it your kids are grown and you have lost a huge chunk of what little time we have on this planet. Watch this movie and learn something from it. Slow down and enjoy the small things, because that is what life is about. Now go hug your kids.

We've seen this movie way too many times...A fisherman catches a magic fish, let's say. Magic fish gives him all the power in the world. When it comes down to it, the magic fish's power doesn't mean anything at all because the fisherman is a lonely guy with no love around from friends or family. Or let's look at "A Christmas Carol" (a classic Christmas-time story about how it's better to give than to receive).Then we have "Click," a glimpse of a busy working-man in America who has a strange amount of laziness when it comes to his family. He doesn't deserve anybody in his life the way he treats them, especially given his choices after he receives a magic remote control that allows his to speed his way through life or alter the way things are perceived to him (ie muting his wife's girlfriend or pausing his wife in the middle of an argument). So in the beginning you really don't care about him because his character is so selfish and lazy...as most of these movies go, he'll quickly learn the error of his ways...or will he? I really don't know what the originality in this film was. I used to love Adam Sandler in everything he released that he starred in, but what is this cheap ripoff of so many films as "Truman Show," "Bruce Almighty," "It's a Wonderful Life," and "Christmas Carol?" And "Pleasantville" comes to mind, although to put that great movie alongside this doesn't seem right...I had to give it a 5. It had slightly funny parts (especially when Rob Schneider wasn't on-screen), a terribly overused comedic soundtrack, interested gags, Christopher Walken was in it for a second (like in "Envy")...yeah, average...

This movie plays like a comedy, does some crappy jokes, which takes this movie down a bit from what it really is - a great drama. It has amazing character development it shows us why family is important. It's a great drama for whole family.

I did find myself laughing and was emotionally affected by the ending. 7/10

"Click" is a be-careful-what-you-wish-for comedy about a driven and harried, up-and-coming architect (Adam Sandler) who finds a unique and "Twilight Zone"-inspired way to balance both work and family. On a trip to find a "universal remote," he stumbles into a Bed, Bath and Beyond (one would love to know how much money BBB shelled out for this product placement par excellence) where he meets a strange man (who else but Christopher Walken?) who gives him a state-of-the-art remote that can single-handedly control not only all his electronic devices but his life as well. For Michael Newman soon discovers that, just by clicking buttons, he can freeze moments or fast forward through all those little unpleasantries that can make daily life so burdensome and onerous. The trouble begins, however, when the remote little takes control and starts racing Michael through his life at warp speed.This is the kind of thing they used to toss off in a typical half-hour long episode of "Bewitched" or "I Dream of Jeannie" - minus, of course, all the cusswords, flatulence gags and dog-humping jokes with which the writers have seen fit to pad out the extra hour or so of screen time they need to fill. (Anyone who goes into "Click" thinking that this will be a family-friendly film is in for a very rude awakening). Then, after about an hour of repetitive, sitcom-level silliness, the film takes an abrupt turn into Capra-esquire sentimentality, of the you-never-know-what-you-have-until-you've-lost-it variety. Yet, although the writing at this point has all the consistency of a melted marshmallow, this still turns out to be the best part of the movie - which tells you a great deal about the quality of the rest of the film. It's odd, too, because for all its we-are-the-world mushy-headedness, the movie can't resist taking the usual egregious swipes at Arabs, gays and overweight people.Sandler has done this sort of shtick so often in the past that he goes through the film virtually on auto-pilot. In addition to Walken, of course, the gifted supporting cast - which includes Kate Beckinsale, David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, and SNL's talented Rachel Dratch do what they can with the material and provide shining moments that help us get through the whole ordeal. But "Click," on the whole, is mass-market movie-making done on a very low scale.

I am not saying here that Click is a terrible movie, because it is not. But I couldn't help feeling minutely disappointed. I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan, though he has done some good work in some surprisingly good films.While Sandler was just about bearable here, even if his character wasn't particularly likable, the film didn't quite work for my tastes. Granted, it does have a very interesting concept. A work-aholic architect who acquires a remote control that allows him to fast forward through things that peeve him? Hmm, I like that idea, really I do.Some of the things that do happen: 1. What do you do if your wife starts bitching? Zip past her.2. What do you do if a dog barks at you? Put him on mute.3. What do you do if your boss starts irritating you? Hit pause, and fart in his face many times.The concept of the story as I have said is a good one and is put to a decent amount of use. There were parts where I laughed, not many though, and there is an emotional core that does leave a lump in your throat at the end. The film is nice to look at and has a good soundtrack. Out of the supporting performances, David Hasselhoff looks as though he is having a lot of fun as the self-absorbed boss, and Christopher Walken does what he can with an underwritten role.However, while she looked stunning, Kate Beckinsale is wasted as the long-suffering wife. The script has its weak spots too as there are parts where the humour is overdone, leaving certain characters(especially Walken's) underdeveloped and card board. Also the direction was disappointingly lacking, and some parts did get quite silly or heavy-handed such as how the dogs behave. I also felt the film was a little too long, some scenes in the middle half didn't have to be as dragged out as they were.Overall, it has its moments, but doesn't quite work. 6/10 Bethany Cox

It made me cry...
Only marvel movies have made me cry...
But this did...

CAST: ADAM SANDLER; KATE BECKINSALE AND CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.Adam Sandler is renowned for his irrepressible comedic genius. He possesses a rare talent consisting of an ensemble of slapstick buffoonery and egocentric satire. His formulaic comedies have spawned a generation of die-hard Sandler fans expecting nothing less than the pervasive wit and guile of Adam Sandler in full swing.In Click, Sandler plays Michael Newman a workaholic trying desperately trying to make partner in a successful firm. His demanding boss is adequately portrayed by David Hasselhoff. Sandler tries frantically to please his superior, but his efforts largely go unnoticed. The result is continual work dissatisfaction and mounting pressure on his home life.Sandler's wife is played by the exquisite Kate Beckinsale. To label her gorgeous would be doing her a grave injustice for she is the quintessential picture of beauty. She is the doting wife of an overworked architect and the attentive mother of two delightful children. The strain of her relationship with her husband is driving a wedge between them  that is until Sandler is gifted a universal remote.This is no ordinary remote though: it controls the passage of time and allows for a thorough revision of the past and a rapid transition into the future. What it doesn't allow for are changes to deeds already committed. The angel of death, who hands Sandler the remote, cautions him that the device is non-returnable.Naturally Sandler's curiosity is piqued and he begins toying with the quirky device. A series of humorous incidents ensue, but the comedy is hardly worth laughing at. The audiences remained largely quiet throughout the duration of the film, with the exception of the usual sexual innuendo and toilet humour which cracked a few smiles.The film goes off the rails for a while but just when it starts losing the audience; it utilizes drama to great effect to reel the crowds back in. Sandler is surprisingly effective in his dramatic performance. It is a detraction from the norm but one which will leave you teary eyed and heartbroken, until the final ten minutes of the film. Christopher Walken is a spectacle to behold in this dramatic comedy.This is a must-see Sandler film, not because the laughs come thick and fast, but because it is able to work on raw emotions so effectively. The concept of family and priorities are essential to the film and you are bound to be wiping the tears from your face in the last quarter.Two-thumbs up!

Click hits the right emotional buttons, but unfortunately those poignant moments are undercut by persistent juvenile humor. It's just hard to take this movie seriously when it's trying to be serious. I have no complaints about Kate Beckinsale in this movie, though. She did a great job, as always.

I love this movie. This is one of my favorite Sandler movies. This was the only movie coming close to making me cry. Incredible heartwarming comedy. Must see if you love Adam Sandler and comedy!

A man got universal remote from a store by scientist then it changes his life awfully...then finally he tries to come back his normal life and he wanted to give first preference to his family.after watching this movie really it changes you atleast something...

The idea was great, I grant you that, it always was. From "Faust" to "It's A Wonderful Life" The what if, the second chance, the realization and all the rest. So, can anyone explain to me why the new moronic turns of this perennial tale. The Jerry Springer sensibility that corrodes, diminishes and ultimate destroys what it should have been a lovely movie is what I took with me as I rushed out of the theater. I think that we should all know by now that technical wizardry is not nearly enough and that audiences are smarter than what the smart ass marketing experts seem to think. Is this movie making money? I don't know but I don't think so not even with a million copy opening week end. How sad really. How sad.

I love this movie . I've been watching it since I was a child/teenager and I rewatched it now in my middle 20s and I still love it . It gets me so emotional every time .
It's a comedy with a deep meaning that has me feeling delighted and content every time I watch it. And I confess I cry near the end every time . It's not the "ha ha" type of comedy really. It's just a light hearted movie with a few jokes here and there and a good emotional message to pass to the viewers. One of my favorites .
The only reason I'm writing this review now so many years later is that I saw the 6.4 rating and I could not believe it . How is that even possible? Maybe from 1s from people expecting to see something else entirely ? What can I say besides how much I still appreciate this movie..

This easy concept of a movie will keep casual movie fans engaged with it's silly exploitation of Sandler's newfound abilities to manipulate the space time continuum. The initial concept gets a full workout and technical buffs can gawk at the simple yet effective editing that goes along with showing how this character sees his world, through his control. Obviously the moral ramifications of such unnatural bastardization's comes at a price, which slowly paints the arc of this story with more serious, dramatic colors. To say that this movie is a unique idea however would be a joke, as derivations linking up to just about every other time traveling morality tale are abound but in the end, whether you enjoyed the goofy site gags or the melodramatic buildup more, the overall message this movie wishes to convey (which could be argued far outweighs the actual material) should stick. This philosophy that the main character came to speak of was a perfect way at translating through more zen-like nods to the "moment" then most mainstream American films have the patience of realizing. Kudos to Click for making the case for this frame of mind without having for one minute to act it out pretentiously on screen, this is how you do NOT just preach to the choir.

I have to confess at the start of this review that I'm not really an Adam Sandler fan. In fact, I might have been the only person in my 6th grade class who didn't see what was so great about Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. It's not that I like appreciation for crude low-brow humor from SNL alumni. I happen to like Will Ferrell, Norm McDonald, and the David Spade/Chris Farley buddy comedies, but Adam Sandler is just a guy who I don't get. There might be times where I laugh during his movies but I see that as a result of so many random bizarre jokes being thrown out at me, that by sheer luck a couple of them actually work. What I think we like about Sandler, isn't necessarily the comedy but it's the warmth behind his movies. I think it's because he's such a lovable character that we love to cheer for Billy Madison to win his high school diploma or for Bobby Bouche to save the day for his coach in The Waterboy.For me, Sandler movies have gotten better as he's seemed to refine his humor and grounded it more in those uplifting story elements with 50 First Dates, Mr. Deeds, and Big Daddy. Unfortunately, Click is a giant step backwards for Sandler. It's disjointed and feels like it's moving too quickly for us to care much, despite a touching scene near the end. By detaching us from any sense of caring what happens to the characters, the film hits rocky ground, because that leaves us with nothing but Sandler's sense of humor to entice us. What's even odder, the laughs are noticeably fewer and farther in between than most Adam Sandler movies. Then again, that might have been a good thing, considering how bizarre Sandler's jokes can be. And don't think "bizarre" is funny because anyone can access the most random corners of their mind and come up with bizarre stuff. The most random corner of Adam Sandler's mind is filled with things like a dog repeatedly humping a stuffed animal and parents who mock the size of their son's "schmiekel" (don't ask). The funny moments that actually worked well in the movie are things you can catch in the 30-second trailer anyway.

When one thinks of an Adam Sandler film, the phrase "juvenile humor" immediately comes to mind, filled with low-brow humor and outlandish acting. Fortunately, "Click" is a departure (for the most part) from that categorization by providing an interesting story, developed characters, and very solid acting.For a basic plot summary, "Click" sees Michael Newman (Sandler) struggling to find time for his family while wearing himself out for his never-impressed boss. On a routine trip to find a universal TV remote, Michael runs into a crazy scientist (played by Christopher Walken) who gives him a "universal remote", alright...one that can control his entire life! Hilarity, emotions, & hijinks ensue.Besides the novel concept, this movie outshines other Sandler flicks due to its heart. While shaping up (in the early goings) to be a hijinks comedy, somewhere along the way a heavy dose of emotion is thrown into the proceedings. By the end of the film, the viewer will actually care about the main characters and want to see their resolutions.Granted, "Click" does still contain some of the typical Sandler low-brow humor, but it isn't too over-the-top or suffocating. Far outweighing that aspect is the above-average acting from pretty much the entire cast, which produces a real connection between characters and audience.Overall, "Click" is a fun little movie (though not for the younger kiddies) that may (at least in a small way) change your perception of Mr. Sandler. This isn't his goofy "Waterboy" or farcical "Billy Madison". Instead, director Frank Coraci crafts an actual storyline filled with character development and fun concepts.

I have never been a fan of Adam Sandler, though I have seen a few of his movies. I am in my 40s and I notice that the appeal for him seems to be with teenagers and young adults--and I assume most of the reviews here are by younger reviewers. So here is a review that might be a little different--a 40-something who is a bit of a hard sell.Overall, I was surprised that I did like this film as much as I did. It was far deeper and less dopey than films like BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE and seemed like an attempt by the rapidly aging Sandler to make a more adult film. While there are still lots of crude jokes that fell flat for me (such as the dog and the stuffed animal), there was still plenty to like and a depth that surprised me. Also, while there were some comedic moments, after a while it became obvious that this was really a comedy-drama--with the second half of the film being very serious and even touching.So here we seem to have an Adam Sandler movie that might just appeal to kids AND parents--one that everyone can get something out of and enjoy. I am happy I saw this one and wouldn't mind seeing more films like it.

"Click" is a interesting film hybrid of comedy, drama and some science fiction with adam sandler and somehow it worked.most adam sandler films tends to the dumb-comedy crowd with he's very old 90's comedy shtick that "Billy Madison" and "Happy Gilmore" started but repeated many times later which give sandler the negative reputation since, but then he give a mature performances in "Punch-Drunk Love", "The Longest Yard", "Reign Over Me" and even "Funny People" he can do drama and be believable without force comedy along with his annoying voice.Click is more or less sci-fi retailing of "it's a wonderful life" about an workaholic architect who has slow-life with his family and getting problems from his boss, after some shopping he discovers by a mysterious person a special remote control which he can skip time (fast forward) and change things in the present (Pause or Mute), at first he's enjoys it's advantages, but slowly it controls his workaholic life, destroying his marriage, relationship with his children and he's family. the film has few comedic moment early-on but their are very sandler standers, but when it get emotional and dramatic it make the film more than just another dumb-comedy.the scene where adam sandler's character finds out that his father died it's probably the saddest heart-breaking scene i have ever seen in a film that's how much family is important.

Heartwarming and thought-provoking comedy-drama that brings laughter and tears in equal measure.First and foremost, Adam Sandler's performance as Michael Newman is delightful. He brings his signature humor and charm to the character, making Michael a relatable and endearing protagonist. Sandler's portrayal evolves from lighthearted comedy to moments of genuine emotion, showcasing his versatility as an actor.The film's premise of a magical remote control that controls time is a unique and creative concept. The comedic moments, especially when Michael uses the remote to manipulate situations, bring a lot of laughs. However, as the story progresses, the film takes an unexpectedly poignant turn, exploring the importance of family and the value of living in the present.The emotional depth of the narrative is beautifully balanced with humor, making Click a touching and heartwarming film. It manages to tug at your heartstrings while still delivering moments of laugh-out-loud comedy.The supporting cast, including Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, and David Hasselhoff, complements Sandler's performance with their own comedic talents. The interactions between the characters add to the film's overall charm.The film's exploration of the consequences of chasing success at the expense of family time is relatable and thought-provoking. It serves as a reminder of the importance of cherishing the moments with our loved ones.In conclusion, Click is a touching and enjoyable film that offers a perfect blend of humor and heartfelt moments. With Adam Sandler's engaging performance, the creative premise, and the film's valuable message, it's a movie that leaves a lasting impression.If you're looking for a comedy-drama that brings laughter, tears, and valuable life lessons, Click is a must-watch. It's a film that reminds us to appreciate the present and cherish the time we have with our loved ones.

Michael Newman loves his family. But he wants to be promoted no matter what, since in this way he could spend more time with his wife, Donna, and Ben and Samantha, his kids. One day,he argues with Donna that he could not stay with his family in an important camp day, and goes out, angry, to buy a universal remote control, since he always had problems with the amount of remote controls they had in their house. He then meets Morty, a strange man and inventor that gives him a one-of-a-kind universal remote control, that cannot be returned. Michael finds out that the remote is literally universal: it controls the universe, and interprets his wishes,altering time and reality, as well as he can ''forward'' things he doesn't want to wait and ''pause'' others. Michael starts using the remote in his way, and discovers that he boss waits forever to give him a promotion, while making him spend more and more time with work each time. The time passes very quick, and the remote is automatically programmed (by his usage of it) to skip or fast-forward many important things of Michael's life. When he sees the thing is out of control, he tries to destroy the remote, but it doesn't work.''Click '' is a mix of comedy and drama, but if I needed to choose a category, it would be drama for sure. The funny parts are only in the beginning and the rest of the movie it's actually sad. It's the first movie with Adam Sandler that I think is worthwhile to watch, since it is the first movie I watch with him that is not full of silly jokes. ( I think comedy actors should make more drama movies - it's impressive how many of them actually are good and beyond the silly cheap movies. Like Jim Carrey, who was great in ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind''). The movie is a life lesson for itself, since it shows a man who faces the consequences of always putting his family behind his work duties, a thing that happens a lot in our modern society. It's very sad to see how Michael's anxiety for promotion, made him be so away from his family and a cold man, as well as his family giving up on him.As I read in the message board, this movie has many things in common to ''It's a Wonderful Life'', a movie that I would definitely recommend to everybody to watch before or after ''Click''.

Michael (Adam Sandler) has a gorgeous wife and the proverbial two kids. He is an architect employed by a tedious boss and Micheal must work extra hours to bring home enough bacon. One day when his own children tease him for mixing up the remote controls, he decides to take action. He will run out and get a universal remote, like the snotty rich neighbors. However, it is rather late at night and the only store open is Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Nevertheless, in the Beyond section of the store, an unusual clerk sells him the ultimate universal remote, one that is free and non-returnable, too. Michael happily returns home. But, wait. Michael soon finds out THIS remote can also stop the dog from barking loudly and fast forward him through a shower or an argument with his wife. Great, is it not? All too soon, Michael learns that the remote has a down side, including missing important moments in his life. And, although he tries, the remote can not be discarded. Help! This is movie that has some funny moments and some good ideas but it's not enough. Sandler has never tried harder to make things work and to keep laughs coming but he ultimately fails. Perhaps this is because of some very tasteless humor when things go awry. Beckingsale is quite wonderful, however, as the much put-upon wife. Walken is always topnotch and it is wonderful to see Winkler and Kavner. With such a cast, one would guess the movie can't miss, but is does. The culprits are probably the so-so script and the uneven direction. In any case, even if you are a Sandler die-hard, you will be left out in the cold by this film. You may even want to click your own remote and fast forward to the end of the film long before the movie's ending.

Michael Newman has it all; a gorgeous wife that really loves him, two beautiful kids, a great home and a job he does well. Still he is not entirely satisfied with how his career is progressing and resents spending time away from big projects that might further him in the company.One night in a Bed Bath and Beyond, while looking for a universal remote for his TV, Michael runs into a guy named Morty. Morty is a bit odd, but gives Micheal the remote. Instead of being meant for a TV, this remote controls your life. Soon Michael is skipping life events that he dislikes and tries to only be present for the good parts.Before Michael understands what he has unleashed he is an old man, dying in a hospital and alone. Can he correct the error or his ways before he dies?Every damn time I watch this I cry. Why? Because it is so damn relatable. How many of us as kids could not wait to go to school? Then graduate so we can be adults and "do whatever we want"? Then as adults, how many of us wish the work week would fly by, etc, etc, etc? Before you know it your kids are grown and you have lost a huge chunk of what little time we have on this planet. Watch this movie and learn something from it. Slow down and enjoy the small things, because that is what life is about. Now go hug your kids.

15 October 2006. This movie can't decide whether it's a comedy or a drama or both. The commendable ambitions of Adam Sandler to continue to expand his acting roles can't escape the director's pull back into the dumb comedy that Sandler has been relegated to many times. The ending portion of the film is representative of how good the movie could have been only to be vacuumed back into the predictable stereotypical "It's a Wonderful Life" fantasy. With a better writer and more careful direction, the premise of this movie along with Adam Sandler could have been one of the breakthrough movies of the year. Yet, unfortunately, while the creative spark and special effects are fun and entertaining, this movie was stuck in the summer fun category instead of Oscar award quality. It's really too bad, Sandler still can't get a break.

We've seen this movie way too many times...A fisherman catches a magic fish, let's say. Magic fish gives him all the power in the world. When it comes down to it, the magic fish's power doesn't mean anything at all because the fisherman is a lonely guy with no love around from friends or family. Or let's look at "A Christmas Carol" (a classic Christmas-time story about how it's better to give than to receive).Then we have "Click," a glimpse of a busy working-man in America who has a strange amount of laziness when it comes to his family. He doesn't deserve anybody in his life the way he treats them, especially given his choices after he receives a magic remote control that allows his to speed his way through life or alter the way things are perceived to him (ie muting his wife's girlfriend or pausing his wife in the middle of an argument). So in the beginning you really don't care about him because his character is so selfish and lazy...as most of these movies go, he'll quickly learn the error of his ways...or will he? I really don't know what the originality in this film was. I used to love Adam Sandler in everything he released that he starred in, but what is this cheap ripoff of so many films as "Truman Show," "Bruce Almighty," "It's a Wonderful Life," and "Christmas Carol?" And "Pleasantville" comes to mind, although to put that great movie alongside this doesn't seem right...I had to give it a 5. It had slightly funny parts (especially when Rob Schneider wasn't on-screen), a terribly overused comedic soundtrack, interested gags, Christopher Walken was in it for a second (like in "Envy")...yeah, average...

This movie plays like a comedy, does some crappy jokes, which takes this movie down a bit from what it really is - a great drama. It has amazing character development it shows us why family is important. It's a great drama for whole family.

I did find myself laughing and was emotionally affected by the ending. 7/10

"Click" is a be-careful-what-you-wish-for comedy about a driven and harried, up-and-coming architect (Adam Sandler) who finds a unique and "Twilight Zone"-inspired way to balance both work and family. On a trip to find a "universal remote," he stumbles into a Bed, Bath and Beyond (one would love to know how much money BBB shelled out for this product placement par excellence) where he meets a strange man (who else but Christopher Walken?) who gives him a state-of-the-art remote that can single-handedly control not only all his electronic devices but his life as well. For Michael Newman soon discovers that, just by clicking buttons, he can freeze moments or fast forward through all those little unpleasantries that can make daily life so burdensome and onerous. The trouble begins, however, when the remote little takes control and starts racing Michael through his life at warp speed.This is the kind of thing they used to toss off in a typical half-hour long episode of "Bewitched" or "I Dream of Jeannie" - minus, of course, all the cusswords, flatulence gags and dog-humping jokes with which the writers have seen fit to pad out the extra hour or so of screen time they need to fill. (Anyone who goes into "Click" thinking that this will be a family-friendly film is in for a very rude awakening). Then, after about an hour of repetitive, sitcom-level silliness, the film takes an abrupt turn into Capra-esquire sentimentality, of the you-never-know-what-you-have-until-you've-lost-it variety. Yet, although the writing at this point has all the consistency of a melted marshmallow, this still turns out to be the best part of the movie - which tells you a great deal about the quality of the rest of the film. It's odd, too, because for all its we-are-the-world mushy-headedness, the movie can't resist taking the usual egregious swipes at Arabs, gays and overweight people.Sandler has done this sort of shtick so often in the past that he goes through the film virtually on auto-pilot. In addition to Walken, of course, the gifted supporting cast - which includes Kate Beckinsale, David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, and SNL's talented Rachel Dratch do what they can with the material and provide shining moments that help us get through the whole ordeal. But "Click," on the whole, is mass-market movie-making done on a very low scale.

I am not saying here that Click is a terrible movie, because it is not. But I couldn't help feeling minutely disappointed. I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan, though he has done some good work in some surprisingly good films.While Sandler was just about bearable here, even if his character wasn't particularly likable, the film didn't quite work for my tastes. Granted, it does have a very interesting concept. A work-aholic architect who acquires a remote control that allows him to fast forward through things that peeve him? Hmm, I like that idea, really I do.Some of the things that do happen: 1. What do you do if your wife starts bitching? Zip past her.2. What do you do if a dog barks at you? Put him on mute.3. What do you do if your boss starts irritating you? Hit pause, and fart in his face many times.The concept of the story as I have said is a good one and is put to a decent amount of use. There were parts where I laughed, not many though, and there is an emotional core that does leave a lump in your throat at the end. The film is nice to look at and has a good soundtrack. Out of the supporting performances, David Hasselhoff looks as though he is having a lot of fun as the self-absorbed boss, and Christopher Walken does what he can with an underwritten role.However, while she looked stunning, Kate Beckinsale is wasted as the long-suffering wife. The script has its weak spots too as there are parts where the humour is overdone, leaving certain characters(especially Walken's) underdeveloped and card board. Also the direction was disappointingly lacking, and some parts did get quite silly or heavy-handed such as how the dogs behave. I also felt the film was a little too long, some scenes in the middle half didn't have to be as dragged out as they were.Overall, it has its moments, but doesn't quite work. 6/10 Bethany Cox

It made me cry...
Only marvel movies have made me cry...
But this did...

CAST: ADAM SANDLER; KATE BECKINSALE AND CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.Adam Sandler is renowned for his irrepressible comedic genius. He possesses a rare talent consisting of an ensemble of slapstick buffoonery and egocentric satire. His formulaic comedies have spawned a generation of die-hard Sandler fans expecting nothing less than the pervasive wit and guile of Adam Sandler in full swing.In Click, Sandler plays Michael Newman a workaholic trying desperately trying to make partner in a successful firm. His demanding boss is adequately portrayed by David Hasselhoff. Sandler tries frantically to please his superior, but his efforts largely go unnoticed. The result is continual work dissatisfaction and mounting pressure on his home life.Sandler's wife is played by the exquisite Kate Beckinsale. To label her gorgeous would be doing her a grave injustice for she is the quintessential picture of beauty. She is the doting wife of an overworked architect and the attentive mother of two delightful children. The strain of her relationship with her husband is driving a wedge between them  that is until Sandler is gifted a universal remote.This is no ordinary remote though: it controls the passage of time and allows for a thorough revision of the past and a rapid transition into the future. What it doesn't allow for are changes to deeds already committed. The angel of death, who hands Sandler the remote, cautions him that the device is non-returnable.Naturally Sandler's curiosity is piqued and he begins toying with the quirky device. A series of humorous incidents ensue, but the comedy is hardly worth laughing at. The audiences remained largely quiet throughout the duration of the film, with the exception of the usual sexual innuendo and toilet humour which cracked a few smiles.The film goes off the rails for a while but just when it starts losing the audience; it utilizes drama to great effect to reel the crowds back in. Sandler is surprisingly effective in his dramatic performance. It is a detraction from the norm but one which will leave you teary eyed and heartbroken, until the final ten minutes of the film. Christopher Walken is a spectacle to behold in this dramatic comedy.This is a must-see Sandler film, not because the laughs come thick and fast, but because it is able to work on raw emotions so effectively. The concept of family and priorities are essential to the film and you are bound to be wiping the tears from your face in the last quarter.Two-thumbs up!

Click hits the right emotional buttons, but unfortunately those poignant moments are undercut by persistent juvenile humor. It's just hard to take this movie seriously when it's trying to be serious. I have no complaints about Kate Beckinsale in this movie, though. She did a great job, as always.

Now here's something rather paradoxical. I saw the trailer for the new Adam Sandler vehicle, Click, and it was by and large pretty funny, while obvious, and giving the impression that it would be a straight-out comedy. The set-up to the film isn't bad at all, and is sort of promising. But there's something troubling about what is even more obvious as the film goes along. It may be a matter of minutes depending on how soon it might click, no pun intended, what is going on with Sandler's character Michael. And Christopher Walken's ominous, crazy character as the kind of guide for him also brings ahead some clues. It's typical, of course, but it might have been able to bring some more creativity than ended up happening. As it is, I found myself feeling uneasy throughout the third act as Sandler's character has his remote fast-forward through many years and events leaving him in a perpetual sadness until you-know-what with a formula like this finally kicks in. That a lot of this is really overly sentimental and very movie-message like is disappointing, as the filmmakers try to turn around a usual Sandler comedy on its side for the 'Carol' side of it. That it's all wrapped up in this schematic of the film's structure really brings the film down in a way I haven't seen since Sandler's worst film 8 Crazy Nights.Luckily, when the film IS funny and Sandler and his hit or miss screenwriters get some jokes that work, they do almost as well as those of his (compared to this) classic 90s movie work. True, there are only so many times one can watch a dog have his way with a cushion, but the gag works once or twice. And there are some unexpected bits in a kind of unspoken way in Sandler's films that do spark up some laughs from the practical one-gimmick. Sometimes, too, I even found myself having big laughs when no one else in the theater had them, which I took as a good sign. Plus, the cast is, albeit a little 'uh-huh', not too bad at all for what they're required for (which includes, yes, Sean Astin in a speedo). In fact, if the entire film was just from the first turning point of figuring out the remote to when it 'turns' on him, so to speak, it would be a very good (though short) movie, with at least one or two memorable bits. But in its total running time, my patience wore thin far too many a time, leaving me at the end remembering too much what didn't work than what did. In short, it's one of Sandler and company's lesser works.

I love this movie. This is one of my favorite Sandler movies. This was the only movie coming close to making me cry. Incredible heartwarming comedy. Must see if you love Adam Sandler and comedy!

A man got universal remote from a store by scientist then it changes his life awfully...then finally he tries to come back his normal life and he wanted to give first preference to his family.after watching this movie really it changes you atleast something...

The idea was great, I grant you that, it always was. From "Faust" to "It's A Wonderful Life" The what if, the second chance, the realization and all the rest. So, can anyone explain to me why the new moronic turns of this perennial tale. The Jerry Springer sensibility that corrodes, diminishes and ultimate destroys what it should have been a lovely movie is what I took with me as I rushed out of the theater. I think that we should all know by now that technical wizardry is not nearly enough and that audiences are smarter than what the smart ass marketing experts seem to think. Is this movie making money? I don't know but I don't think so not even with a million copy opening week end. How sad really. How sad.

I love this movie . I've been watching it since I was a child/teenager and I rewatched it now in my middle 20s and I still love it . It gets me so emotional every time .
It's a comedy with a deep meaning that has me feeling delighted and content every time I watch it. And I confess I cry near the end every time . It's not the "ha ha" type of comedy really. It's just a light hearted movie with a few jokes here and there and a good emotional message to pass to the viewers. One of my favorites .
The only reason I'm writing this review now so many years later is that I saw the 6.4 rating and I could not believe it . How is that even possible? Maybe from 1s from people expecting to see something else entirely ? What can I say besides how much I still appreciate this movie..

This easy concept of a movie will keep casual movie fans engaged with it's silly exploitation of Sandler's newfound abilities to manipulate the space time continuum. The initial concept gets a full workout and technical buffs can gawk at the simple yet effective editing that goes along with showing how this character sees his world, through his control. Obviously the moral ramifications of such unnatural bastardization's comes at a price, which slowly paints the arc of this story with more serious, dramatic colors. To say that this movie is a unique idea however would be a joke, as derivations linking up to just about every other time traveling morality tale are abound but in the end, whether you enjoyed the goofy site gags or the melodramatic buildup more, the overall message this movie wishes to convey (which could be argued far outweighs the actual material) should stick. This philosophy that the main character came to speak of was a perfect way at translating through more zen-like nods to the "moment" then most mainstream American films have the patience of realizing. Kudos to Click for making the case for this frame of mind without having for one minute to act it out pretentiously on screen, this is how you do NOT just preach to the choir.

I have to confess at the start of this review that I'm not really an Adam Sandler fan. In fact, I might have been the only person in my 6th grade class who didn't see what was so great about Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. It's not that I like appreciation for crude low-brow humor from SNL alumni. I happen to like Will Ferrell, Norm McDonald, and the David Spade/Chris Farley buddy comedies, but Adam Sandler is just a guy who I don't get. There might be times where I laugh during his movies but I see that as a result of so many random bizarre jokes being thrown out at me, that by sheer luck a couple of them actually work. What I think we like about Sandler, isn't necessarily the comedy but it's the warmth behind his movies. I think it's because he's such a lovable character that we love to cheer for Billy Madison to win his high school diploma or for Bobby Bouche to save the day for his coach in The Waterboy.For me, Sandler movies have gotten better as he's seemed to refine his humor and grounded it more in those uplifting story elements with 50 First Dates, Mr. Deeds, and Big Daddy. Unfortunately, Click is a giant step backwards for Sandler. It's disjointed and feels like it's moving too quickly for us to care much, despite a touching scene near the end. By detaching us from any sense of caring what happens to the characters, the film hits rocky ground, because that leaves us with nothing but Sandler's sense of humor to entice us. What's even odder, the laughs are noticeably fewer and farther in between than most Adam Sandler movies. Then again, that might have been a good thing, considering how bizarre Sandler's jokes can be. And don't think "bizarre" is funny because anyone can access the most random corners of their mind and come up with bizarre stuff. The most random corner of Adam Sandler's mind is filled with things like a dog repeatedly humping a stuffed animal and parents who mock the size of their son's "schmiekel" (don't ask). The funny moments that actually worked well in the movie are things you can catch in the 30-second trailer anyway.
