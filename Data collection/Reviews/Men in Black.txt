God, do I remember when this movie came out in the summer of '97. This movie brought aliens back in the strongest way possible, everyone was singing Will Smith's catchy song of the same title. But I remember seeing this movie and just wearing out the VHS when we got it. As a 12 year old kid, I just adored this movie and so badly wanted to be apart of the Men in Black. I thought they were so cool. Years later, I got the DVD because I wanted to go for a trip down memory lane, this may not be as cool as when I was a kid but this is still a very fun sci-fi flick that makes you laugh, squirm and also has some good scares. There is a reason why Will Smith is a star, he made this movie a riot to watch and has every star quality you could imagine. He and Tommy Lee Jones take us on an incredible ride through our world where the person that lives next door to you just might be an alien.Agent K is a member of the Men in Black, a secret agency without ties to any government, whose goal is to maintain Earth as a "neutral zone" for aliens seeking refuge. K's former partner, D, has just retired, but identifies New York City detective James Edwards as a potential replacement, due to his agility to follow a disguised alien. After putting Edwards through several tests, K offers him the chance to join the MIB, which Edwards accepts. Edwards' past identity is erased, and he becomes Agent J, assigned to K by the agency director, Zed. The fleet warns that a "Bug," a member of a giant cockroach-like alien species that are currently at war with another alien race, has crashed down to Earth and is seeking an object known as the Galaxy that would turn the tide in favor of the Bugs. To prevent this, they are willing to destroy the Earth unless the MIB can secure the Galaxy before their deadline within a day.The make up effects in this movie are just incredible. The main villain that was the bug was one of the creepiest looking things you've ever seen. Vincent D'Onofrio who is one of those great secrets of Hollywood always delivers an outstanding performance makes the villain even more creepier because of his jerks and twitches. The CGI effects are very noticeable but I don't think they could have gone any other way since the aliens are over the top. The humor is on key, one of my favorite scenes is when Tommy Lee Jones is trying to find out information and you see Will Smith in the background who is helping a lady give birth to an alien and the tentacles come out and start carrying him around everywhere and even slam him on the car. Men in Black is the definition of a summer blockbuster, it's funny, action packed, had the great actors and a very catchy song that is now stuck in my head thanks to this review. I still like Men in Black, I think anyone who just lets go and watches this film is guaranteed to have a good time too.7/10

As my one line summary says, this is one of the best sci-fi comedies ever made, next to the classic Ghostbusters and the highly underrated Evolution. This movie has action, comedy, and some of the best special effects in the last ten years. Rick Baker, Hollywood's resident 'creature man', as I like to call him, has made such a wide variety of aliens. There's the first alien we see, Mikey; there's the Worm Guys; and the villanous Bug. But there are many others, such as Frank the Pug and the twins. The squid baby is pretty neat. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have an undeniable chemistry together, which repeats itself in the sequel. Linda Fiorentino is also good as the leading lady, and veteran actor Rip Torn is gruff as the head of MIB, Zed. Vincent D'Onofrio is also pretty good. My favorite line: "No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor that we are aware of." All in all, two thumbs up, baby!

Agent K (Jones)'s partner retires, so he has to find a new one. Street cop Will Smith seems an unlikely contender to join this very special service and help K battle illegal aliens.Barry Sonnenfeld's experience as a cinematographer put him in good stead for planning this quirky fun sci-fi comedy.Men in Black is given life by Sonnenfeld's shot-choices, for greatest comic effect, terrific fun musical score by Danny Elfman, and two perfectly cast actors: Tommy Lee Jones' wry delivery and Will Smith's comic persona make for a movie with some real personality.Vincent D'Onofrio is a memorable bad guy - especially when we don't have to look at his regular face.A few death scenes will be too gruesome for kiddies, but once they're a certain age its bound to be one of their favourite movies. Such terrific imaginative fun.10/10Woman: "You here to make fun of me, too?' K: "No maam, we here at the FBI do not have a sense of humour we're aware of. May we come in?"

The Men in Black(based on a comic I've never read, spawning a TV series I haven't watched, so I can make no comparisons to either) are an agency that protect Earth from not only what the aliens, some of whom are already here, might do to it, but also the common man's ignorance of this situation. It opens a doorway into a fantastic world(whilst playing it straight since most of these guys are used to this stuff) that would be overwhelming were it not for rookie agent J(Will Smith, who brings both his sass and undeniable charm) posing as a proxy for the audience, asking the questions we want to, and being given the exposition and explanations that we need. He is likable in his naiveté and his efforts to help the people affected by the outer-space stuff, and the odd couple dynamic between him and K(Tommy Lee Jones, awesome and enjoyable as the old grump who's blasé about what they experience) is great, as are the various other character aspects. Linda Fiorentino is perfectly cast as a somewhat cold coroner, and she has a nice, strong female role. As the villain, we have Vincent D'Onofrio giving an unforgettable and unique performance as the large cockroach(!) wearing the skin of farmer Edgar. It's a size or two too small, leading to it/him making some rather inelegant movements and possessing poor motor skills. And don't worry, at the same time, he's seriously scary. He's immensely physically powerful, and he can't *stand* humans. This really gets into perspective, and that the importance of something is not defined by its size. This is primarily a comedy, as well as a fun sci-fi action adventure with some very unexpected situations and outcomes. It's exciting, engaging and a cool universe that we want to see more of, with this being a brief(and well-paced) peek at roughly 90 minutes. There are creatively designed creatures and big, shiny guns. Danny Elfman supplies this with a bombastic and playful score. There is a bit of moderate to strong language and a little violence and gore(little of it involving people, and just about none of that graphic) in this. I recommend this to fans of the stars and the concept. 7/10

I am very upset that most people take this movie too seriously This movie is just a nice comedy with a very intriguing subject. Most people try to find bug in this movie but i believe that they should just sit back and enjoy the great epic line. Let's be serious do you believe that a galaxy can be carried around a cat's belt or that "Elivs is not dead he's just gone home" ? For this reason I believe this is an excellent comedy with a Sf theme. I also appreciate that the acting is very good and the script is very nicely written. I urge people to stop taking the "noisy cricket" too serious! This movie is making fun of the people who take this sort of things too seriously.

This movie was really fun to watch the first time I saw it in theaters, upon subsequent viewings, however, it loses its luster. Still though, it is still a fun movie to watch. Unlike the sequel which rushes us through the story, this one takes a bit more time developing the characters even though it is only about ten minutes longer. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good and funny, especially Smith because he is the new guy so he is seeing all the weird aliens and such for the first time. This is also something missing from the sequel. In the end though the reason I probably like this one so much is that it sort of reminds me of a Ghostbuster movie, and seeing as how we will most likely never see another sequel to that movie it is nice to see a movie sort of like it in that they are keeping tabs and hunting aliens rather than ghosts. The pug dog scene is funny, and the dog is not over used as in the sequel, and there is also a funny scene where Will Smith must deliver an alien baby...their main objective in this one is to track down an alien insect that has hijacked the skin of a guy and is trying to find a universe. If he succeeds the Earth is destroyed, of course Tommy Lee's character is so calm about the whole situation that you feel you have nothing to worry about. So for a funny movie that has great scenes of Will Smith training and becoming a Man in Black watch this film and do yourself a favor and skip part two...not that it was entirely bad, I liked it okay, but it just seems like an unnecessary sequel.

I wanted to rewatch this movie as part of a marathon of classics that I'm going through with my girlfriend and it was one of the first ones she suggested. I didn't remember much of the movie from the last time I've seen it but I knew it was good, or at least that's how I remembered it. So it was to my surprise that I found a ridiculous amount of plot holes, non-existent backstories, and many feeble attempts at creating a coherent and immersive world that would make you feel like it's actually real. It was especially shocking seeing as this movie is regarded as a timeless, iconic, classic, and that's I was left greatly disappointed. For example, Edwards, (or Agent J), had absolutely no back story whatsoever. We never learn about his family or loved ones or frankly anyone who even knew him. I mean the guy was NYPD for god's sakes. So it really felt like lazy writing when we were meant to believe that in order for Edwards to join MIB, he had to completely disappear from the world he once lived in. In addition, the ending felt rushed and the story, (which had the potential to be something special), came up lacking to say the least. But don't get me wrong, the movie had it's bright spots like it's humor and the chemistry between agents "J" and "K". However, it's really apparent how much potential this movie and it's story had so it's sad to see the final product not meet the expectations. All in all it was a decent watch a pretty good comedy to say the least. Would recommend if you're looking for a quick enjoyable watch.

"Men in Black" is a fast-paced action-comedy that over-achieves the whole way.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith make an amazing comedy team as the title characters who protect the Earth from the scum of the universe. Everything is tongue-in-cheek and the whole film works in a really great way.  A great film that benefits from its characters and amazing special effects.  4 out of 5 stars.

The less that we could say is that movies about extra-terrestrials are becoming more and more fashionable. It's certainly the most fertile period for alien movies since the '50s. At the time, these flicks were some kind of Cold War metaphors that promoted anti-communism and McCarthyism and were disguised as tales depicting an invasion from outer-space. Today, it's mainly a very valuable excuse for developing special effects and ultra-sophisticated animatronic creatures. Only, in the case that's picking our interest right now, there's something different.It must be specified beforehand that there are different kinds of alien movies. The first kind is the invasion film which dominated the silver screen in the middle of the twentieth century and which seems gaining in popularity since recent box-office successes like "Independence Day". The second kind is the benign alien movie a la "E.T." where space invaders are kindly and inoffensive and where humans look like a primitive form of life in the universe."Men in Black" belongs to a third type that we don't see much often. We could call it the alien comedy. It's a film genre that is not much approached and which releases even fewer great successes on the box-office side as well as on the critical side. There has been "Mars Attacks!", but critics didn't hook to that kind of iconoclast humor from Tim Burton. But with "MiB", they will get hooked for sure."Men in Black" stars the endlessly serious Tommy Lee Jones and the rising star Will Smith. Jones plays the role of K, a MiB agent, that is an organization which monitors extra-terrestrial activities on Earth. K hires Smith (re-named J) after he successfully pursued an alien in the streets of New York City.Their first mission together consists in recovering a galaxy (because it seems that the size doesn't have any importance) on 'Orion's Belt'. Their adversary is a 'bug disguised' as Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio) who is also searching for the galaxy. With the passing of the events lived by the two agents, we gradually discover the Men in Black world, their weapons, the different species of extra-terrestrials who live on Earth and what their job implies (and it's not included in any job guide...).It is hard to define what is the 'meat' of the movie. It could be the duo formed by the two principal actors, the futuristic gadgets which will make salivate those who have an eye on advanced technologies or it could also be the aliens, who are CG, played by actors with special costumes or remote-controlled. In fact, there's a little bit of all this. But I'd say that the most interesting moments are those which make the audience laugh wildly.In that case, it's Will Smith who's the best. In a performance that seems to be an evolution from his hot-shot role in "Independence Day", Smith is incredibly funny and wacky and he always provides good laughs, should it be for moments of physical comedy or when he makes the use of jokes and irony.And what could be better to complete a jester role than combining it with its total opposite? This fact makes that the movie enters in the category of 'odd couple' films. We must admit it, Jones plays his role with professionalism and his serious and his calm of stone give him a particular look in the tongue-in-cheek style. The sequence of the car in the tunnel with Elvis Presley's "Promised Land" playing in the background is the best example. In fact, the only moment where he laughs, it's when he tells a joke that is so appalling that the viewer could only laugh of him and not of his joke.I also fairly loved the famous segment where K and J's boss, Zed (Rip Torn), displays pictures of real-life people who are supposed to be aliens themselves. In the lot, I've spotted Steven Spielberg (I've always told myself that he had to be from another planet), Danny DeVito (who redefines the 'little green man' term) and Sylvester Stallone (who apparently had difficulties to get rid of his extra-terrestrial accent). And at the end of the movie, we also learn that Dennis Rodman would be an alien too, which wouldn't be too surprising for obvious reasons...I've been somehow muddled by Vincent D'Onofrio's performance. Was he really there during the entire movie moving in such a mechanical way? Or was he played by a giant-sized animated puppet by moments? Anyway, in both cases, we can only raise our hat.I wouldn't say the same thing for principal actress Linda Fiorentino who looked very annoying. The end of the movie is also ambiguous.Special effects are mentionable. Aliens, even if they are totally peculiar, are well-conceived, should it be with the help of computers or from Rick Baker's hand. It must be said that the fact that the story is an adaptation of a rather unknown comic series (which also proves that comics' adaptations do not always involve superheroes), there must be a special treatment that should be brought to the presentation because comics images are rather stylized. The final result is more than satisfying.In a genre not much approached like the sci-fi comedy genre, "Men in Black" is probably the greatest representative of it since "Ghostbusters" in 1984. It's a very funny thrill ride that you would want to see again and again...

After the horribly cheesy "Independence Day" of the previous year, it was great to see the actor that saved that movie from being completely unwatchable - Will Smith - get a chance to save the planet in a quality film. From the opening of the film where "Mikey", an illegal alien from another planet is disguised as an illegal alien from another country, to the end when we see the earth just as a marble in a pouch of many belonging to an extraterrestrial being, I found this film to be thought provoking, original, and very funny.Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) and Will Smith (Agent J) are perfect in their roles. Not since Lenny Briscoe and Mike Logan were partners on "Law and Order" has the young cop/old cop routine been done so well with such great chemistry and deadpan humor. All of the supporting roles work too. Rip Torn is great as Zed, the head of the secret government organization - the "Men In Black" - who are in charge of overseeing the visits of extraterrestrials who have chosen to establish contact with earth and in some cases become semi-permanent residents of this planet. His great one-liners include telling a group of rejected job applicants - who really don't know what kind of job they've applied for - "Congratulations gentlemen. You are all we've come to expect from years of government training".Some of the rank and file employees of the agency are aliens themselves. Unmotivated and not particularly loyal, they enjoy hanging out in the break room drinking coffee, smoking heavily, and collecting cheap miniatures of the Statue of Liberty. Vincent D'Onofrio is also outstanding in the dual role of Edgar, a human who gets eaten by a malicious alien cockroach, and also as the cockroach himself as he tools around New York City in his "brand new Edgar suit" - Edgar's skin - in an attempt to appear human while trying to start an intergalactic war.Any human who happens to encounter an alien won't remember it thanks to the neuralizer - a device the size of a fountain pen - that the "Men In Black" administer to erase any resulting memories. This includes employees of the agency themselves, should they choose to quit or retire. The underlying purpose of all of this covering up makes sense when Smith's character, during his orientation session, tells Tommy Lee Jones that he thinks that people could handle the truth about aliens living among them. Jones' (Agent K's) response is: "A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals and you know it." This is hard to argue with when you think about the acts that people throughout history have performed as a mob that they would never have done as individuals. I really enjoyed this film, and its smart humor has held up over the years. I think in the future many will wonder, as I still do, why this film didn't get a nod at the Academy Awards other than its award for best makeup, at the very least for the screenplay.

Yeah this movie was ok, but it wasn't one of the best movies i've seen. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are both good in the titles roles, but the movie itself has a plot line as thin as a piece of notebook paper, and some of the jokes aren't funny. Plus the dialogue is dumb. So i went to see this movie expecting to see a great movie, and I didn't. I give Men In Black a 5 out of 10. It was OK but not what it was hyped to be.

On the surface, a film featuring the straight-laced Tommy Lee Jones fighting aliens would seem to be a terrible idea. However, throw in some humor from Will Smith and some great filmmakers, and all of a sudden you have created a classic, genre-busting experience.For a basic plot summary, "Men in Black" sees Agent K (Jones) policing hidden aliens that constitute our planet unbeknownst to the general population. But, since K is starting to get a bit long in the tooth, he sets about bringing a little bit of new blood into the MIB organization, which is where James Edwards (Smith), an NYPD street cop, comes into the picture.The chemistry between Jones (the "straight man") and Smith (the "cutup") is what really makes this movie fun to watch. Their banter back and forth never stops from beginning to end and is always good for a chuckle.Of course, just the concept of the film alone is unique in and of itself. Though the potential for utter failure was quite high, director Barry Sonnenfield (with probably more than a little help from executive producer Steven Spielberg) manages to make the film take itself just seriously enough to work, not but not seriously enough to prevent a lot of fun from creeping into the screenplay.Overall, "Men in Black" is just a fun film that (in its day) was something completely new to the cinematic landscape. Unless you just really aren't into the often goofy nature of the movie, you will enjoy the special effects and witty banter thoroughly.

This is one of the most memorable sci-fi movies I have seen. It's nothing really epic per say, but the unique aspect of it all makes it stand out. Well at least when it came out. This movie had elements that hasn't been done before it and has a simple plot but it's interesting and engaging. Alien movies has been done countless times before but what makes this movie stand out is the investigative side of it. Instead of a one side fighting another in a constant battle. I first saw this movie during my childhood and thought it was the coolest thing ever and thought the soundtrack was so awesome. Even the Will Smith rap song that went with the movie during my childhood. The plot is about a group of special people that balance out the extraterrestrial life forms that are on earth and keep things secret for the rest of the world. And also wipe out aliens that are a threat to the planet earth. As the movie progresses you learn more about how the MIB work through the eyes of agent J(Will Smith) who is a new recruit. Who does a great job with his role while adding a bit of humor into the mix. Agent K(Tommy Lee Jone) is the really serious one of the two and takes his job very very seriously and is always serious. But the pair works well in this movie. Overall this is a fun sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and for the most part it works.7.8/10

I'm about 16 years late seeing this, and I saw the third one first (with no need for #2), but I must say that this is one of the most fun movie-watching experiences I've ever had. It was non-stop laughs and thrills from beginning to end. The element which stuck out to me as being done extraordinarily well was the writing, specifically the comic interplay between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Their characters are so different, and yet play off each other so well. Even the smaller parts were well-written and played. Of particular amusement to me was the largely physical performance given by Vincent D'Onofrio as the main bad bug. You can tell he gave it his all with his awkward speech patterns and movements. It really seemed like he was adjusting to a human body, and it was all done with a sly sense of humor. The only thing I find lacking was some dated CG, but considering it came out over 15 years ago, it was fine. If anything it adds to the B-movie charm, and some of alien design was probably influenced by 1950's "Creature Features" anyway. All things considered, it was an absolutely incredible and enthralling viewing experience. It's just a shame I waited so long to check it out.

slick and boring. glitz and mud. a smart action movie is too much to ask for i guess. the movie falls somewhere betewen being a smart funny movie and a smart action flick and falls in the stupid neither category.will smith looks stylish enough to carry it all off. there are a lot of funny bits, assuming you havent dozed off, u might catch them.good luck.a 5 for nothingness

"Men in Black" and "Galaxy Quest" are in my mind the best sci-fi comedies ever made, because they are both hilarious parodies of two different cultures. Whereas the latter spoofed obsessed fans who take sci-fi entertainment WAY too seriously, this one spoofs the paranoid, tin-foil-hat brand of conspiracy theorists. It has funny characters, witty lines, and does not at all take itself seriously.There are a lot of small details that can take multiple viewings to catch. One thing I found funnier the second time I watched it is the scene where Will Smith has just been severely lectured by his boss in the interrogation room when Tommy Lee Jones enters, asks a few questions, and tells Smith to come with him. Smith: "I can't, there's still a lot of paperwork to fill out." Jones: "No, the paperwork is all taken care of." Smith's boss (walking by): "Hey, nice work, Edwards!" This is one of many quick, funny scenes that you only really get if you're paying attention.All the actors do a good job, too. I thought Rip Torn was the funniest character, and Edgar the bug was hilariously gross. Linda Fiorentino was one of the coolest female characters ever. She put Ripley to shame. Every time I watch this, I want to marry her.Overall, it's a great comedy that is clever and fun all the way through. 8/10 stars.

Agents Jay (Will Smith) and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) protect our world, that is crammed full of aliens who live among us, and most of them are respectful citizens of planet Earth, but every race can have a bad apple or two. Smith and Jones make an unlikely pair, but they work in harmony really well here, and it's a pretty funny adventure.Fine special effects help to bring the aliens in MIB to life, and they have as much character as the duo in black, and they get just as many laughs. The film carries a good plot and is entertaining from the opening scene; which sets the tone of the film nicely, and makes you yearn for some more.8/10

As my one line summary says, this is one of the best sci-fi comedies ever made, next to the classic Ghostbusters and the highly underrated Evolution. This movie has action, comedy, and some of the best special effects in the last ten years. Rick Baker, Hollywood's resident 'creature man', as I like to call him, has made such a wide variety of aliens. There's the first alien we see, Mikey; there's the Worm Guys; and the villanous Bug. But there are many others, such as Frank the Pug and the twins. The squid baby is pretty neat. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have an undeniable chemistry together, which repeats itself in the sequel. Linda Fiorentino is also good as the leading lady, and veteran actor Rip Torn is gruff as the head of MIB, Zed. Vincent D'Onofrio is also pretty good. My favorite line: "No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor that we are aware of." All in all, two thumbs up, baby!

This had been around on television for some time and I'd avoided it because it seemed so popular among the crowd that likes to see gore and ooze on the screen, and because I tuned in for a few minutes and caught scene in which the two men in black (Smith and Jones -- two exotic names for you) used ray guns to blow the head off an alien, and then another different head, covered with elastic glue, wriggled into sight. Enough is enough.But I caught the whole film more recently and the humor is generally more subtle than that, although the usual special effects abound. I'll give an example of what I mean. Smith and Jones have just shot down a huge flying saucer that has whirled around the skies like a just-loosed inflated balloon. The saucer crashes into the earth a hundred yard from the two men, and its momentum carries it towards the duo standing there immobile. Closer and closer, it plows through the earth towards the two fixed figure, stirring up a monstrous cloud of roiling dirt and debris. It looks as if they're about to become part of that debris. Jones is starring defiantly at the approaching catastrophe as if staring down a villain in an action movie. Smith says nothing -- no wisecracks, no cries of fright. He simply glances briefly at Jones with an entreating expression. It's only an instant but it's at least as funny as any other scene in the movie.The catastrophic shoot outs and wreckage may appeal to the kids but what I found most admirable were the smaller touches of absurdity. Multiple TV screens of aliens let loose on earth to lead normal lives include clips of Sly Stallone and a popular network weatherman. Two of the aliens, looking normal, or relatively normal, enter a restaurant for a chat. And the director and writer make sure that we see what they order. Not the usual fare, not sandwiches or spaghetti, but pierogi -- Polish dumplings.I won't carry on about it. Will Smith is our proxy. He finds out what's going on as Tommy Lee Jones leads him through the problems they face. Smith is often puzzled, frightened, and given to ironic cracks. Jones is his opposite, the straight man who never smiles, and who is just as funny because his absurd statements are delivered deadpan. Ditto for Rip Torn, who plays it almost as a serious thriller. Linda Fiorentino is alluring as all get out and I'm glad she was there, so she could tumble through the trees in a short skirt.The kids will get a kick out of the wreckage and the grown ups who are sensitive to the more delicate touches will find it funny.

Agent K (Jones)'s partner retires, so he has to find a new one. Street cop Will Smith seems an unlikely contender to join this very special service and help K battle illegal aliens.Barry Sonnenfeld's experience as a cinematographer put him in good stead for planning this quirky fun sci-fi comedy.Men in Black is given life by Sonnenfeld's shot-choices, for greatest comic effect, terrific fun musical score by Danny Elfman, and two perfectly cast actors: Tommy Lee Jones' wry delivery and Will Smith's comic persona make for a movie with some real personality.Vincent D'Onofrio is a memorable bad guy - especially when we don't have to look at his regular face.A few death scenes will be too gruesome for kiddies, but once they're a certain age its bound to be one of their favourite movies. Such terrific imaginative fun.10/10Woman: "You here to make fun of me, too?' K: "No maam, we here at the FBI do not have a sense of humour we're aware of. May we come in?"

The Men in Black(based on a comic I've never read, spawning a TV series I haven't watched, so I can make no comparisons to either) are an agency that protect Earth from not only what the aliens, some of whom are already here, might do to it, but also the common man's ignorance of this situation. It opens a doorway into a fantastic world(whilst playing it straight since most of these guys are used to this stuff) that would be overwhelming were it not for rookie agent J(Will Smith, who brings both his sass and undeniable charm) posing as a proxy for the audience, asking the questions we want to, and being given the exposition and explanations that we need. He is likable in his naiveté and his efforts to help the people affected by the outer-space stuff, and the odd couple dynamic between him and K(Tommy Lee Jones, awesome and enjoyable as the old grump who's blasé about what they experience) is great, as are the various other character aspects. Linda Fiorentino is perfectly cast as a somewhat cold coroner, and she has a nice, strong female role. As the villain, we have Vincent D'Onofrio giving an unforgettable and unique performance as the large cockroach(!) wearing the skin of farmer Edgar. It's a size or two too small, leading to it/him making some rather inelegant movements and possessing poor motor skills. And don't worry, at the same time, he's seriously scary. He's immensely physically powerful, and he can't *stand* humans. This really gets into perspective, and that the importance of something is not defined by its size. This is primarily a comedy, as well as a fun sci-fi action adventure with some very unexpected situations and outcomes. It's exciting, engaging and a cool universe that we want to see more of, with this being a brief(and well-paced) peek at roughly 90 minutes. There are creatively designed creatures and big, shiny guns. Danny Elfman supplies this with a bombastic and playful score. There is a bit of moderate to strong language and a little violence and gore(little of it involving people, and just about none of that graphic) in this. I recommend this to fans of the stars and the concept. 7/10

As I stated above, Men In Black is just as good as the sci-fi comedies Ghostbusters I and II. But instead of chasing ghost's we're chasing after rogue aliens.James (Will Smith) is an officer in the NYPD and one of the top officers. After a hard night, James is questioned by his own police force for allegedly killing a suspect who fell off a building. As James insists that the person was acting strangely, Agent K (Tommmy Lee Jones) comes in and takes him out. James is welcomed to a secret agency which keeps aliens in check. After a brief examination of his life, James (now Agent J) joins the agency. On his first day, suddenly K and J are on a mission to stop a massive cockroach from destroying Earth and starting a galactic war. The chemistry between Smith and Jones is hilarious. Smith has some great comedy scenes especially when he is using his new weapon, the Noisy Crickett and him trying to deliver a baby squid type creature. The aliens are smart, their inventive, and their just plain fun when seeing how they identify themselves and hide their identities. The story is funny and will keep you laughing at almost every scene.The presentation of aliens as everyday people trying to live normal lives in Manhattan is a lot more fun than the presentation of murderous aliens (Independence Day). Another great part is that the film isn't overblown with special effects of alien explosions and massive battles. Instead comedy and chemistry keeps this top comedy flowing. Men In Black. Starring: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Linda Fiorentino, and Rip Torn.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.

Men in Black starts as NYPD cop James Edwards (Will Smith) has an encounter with an alien disguised as a human, he is contacted by the mysterious Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) who tells him about a secret organisation that monitor & control alien activity on Earth & if he wants a job he's in. Meanwhile a huge cockroach like alien has landed nearby & is in search of an Arquillian disguised as an antiques dealer (Mike Nussbaum) who has something he needs, a Galaxy in a marble. Edwards accepts the job & he becomes Agent J, he soon finds himself in the thick of the action as an Arquillian battle cruiser threatens to blow up Earth unless the Galaxy is returned to them...Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who replaced Les Mayfield shortly before production began this is a pretty fun sci-fi with some neat special effects but when all said & done doesn't add up to much. Producer Steven Spielberg hired David Koepp to do a rewrite on the script by Ed Solomon which in all fairness ended up pretty good, it doesn't take itself too seriously & was based on character's from a comic book that only ran for 6 issues in 1990 & it's no co-incidence that the film feels like a comic book itself, it's very over-the-top, it's quite funny at times & it's even occasionally witty as well. There's a touch of satire here as the whole alien cover up issue is played for laughs as it's a commonly accepted theory. The cheeky & jokey Will Smith plays nicely of the deadpan Tommy Lee Jones, there are some funny one-liners, some neat aliens & it moves along at a nice pace. There are some good set-pieces as well although overall the story is average fair & while it's undoubtedly fun to watch there's not much substance beyond flashy CGI computer effects & once the whole Men in Black idea has worn off by the 30 minute mark it doesn't really have anywhere else to go & becomes a bit repetitive.Director Sonnenfeld does a fine job, the special effects scenes are impressive & the film has visual flair & style. The alien creatures are very imaginative like the little guy in a mans face controlling him or the baby squid like alien or the worm guy's & all the other's that are dotted throughout the film. The special effects & CGI computer effects are superb as one would expect from a film with this sort of mega budget. That totally out of the blue ending that comes from nowhere is a bit odd though, don't you think? The violence is tame although there are maybe a few scary scenes that might not be suitable for younger children & there is a fair amount of bad language. Apparently Quentin Tarantino was offered the chance to direct Men in Black but turned it down, wow just imagine how the film might of turned out if he had accepted!With a budget of about $90,000,000 Men in Black is well made with excellent production values as one would expect, it has that big budget Hollywood look & feel. Danny Elfman provides his usual recycled score that sounds the same as his other's. The acting is OK, the two leads play off each other well & are an amusing contrast at times, rumour has it after reading the script Will Smith didn't want to do the film but his wife convinced him otherwise. Apparently Clint Eastwood was offered the role of K but turned it down while Chris O'Donnell & David Schwimmer were both offered the part of J but foolishly, considering their's & Will Smith's subsequent careers, said no.Men in Black is a good light hearted sci-fi film that can be witty, funny, clever & exciting but maybe not quite on a consistent level. It's still a very good film though & definitely one worth checking out if you haven't already. Followed by a sequel Men in Black II (2002) a cartoon series Men in Black: The Series (1997 - 2001).

I am very upset that most people take this movie too seriously This movie is just a nice comedy with a very intriguing subject. Most people try to find bug in this movie but i believe that they should just sit back and enjoy the great epic line. Let's be serious do you believe that a galaxy can be carried around a cat's belt or that "Elivs is not dead he's just gone home" ? For this reason I believe this is an excellent comedy with a Sf theme. I also appreciate that the acting is very good and the script is very nicely written. I urge people to stop taking the "noisy cricket" too serious! This movie is making fun of the people who take this sort of things too seriously.

I mean this is a funny enough movie and it doesn't take itself too seriously.The premise is pretty absurd and the movie pokes fun at everything it is setting up so that is kinda funny. The CGI looks like 90s CGI but still not as bad as George Lucas' films that would come out in the next decade.Though I'm not sure how I feel about the opening metaphor about illegal aliens.It does drop some interesting bits about the hubris of man and how we think about the universe. D'Onofrio and Tommy Lee Jones are good in this too.So overall revisiting this film for the first time in probably 15 years it isn't as bad as I thought it would be. A decent way to waste time.

This movie was really fun to watch the first time I saw it in theaters, upon subsequent viewings, however, it loses its luster. Still though, it is still a fun movie to watch. Unlike the sequel which rushes us through the story, this one takes a bit more time developing the characters even though it is only about ten minutes longer. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good and funny, especially Smith because he is the new guy so he is seeing all the weird aliens and such for the first time. This is also something missing from the sequel. In the end though the reason I probably like this one so much is that it sort of reminds me of a Ghostbuster movie, and seeing as how we will most likely never see another sequel to that movie it is nice to see a movie sort of like it in that they are keeping tabs and hunting aliens rather than ghosts. The pug dog scene is funny, and the dog is not over used as in the sequel, and there is also a funny scene where Will Smith must deliver an alien baby...their main objective in this one is to track down an alien insect that has hijacked the skin of a guy and is trying to find a universe. If he succeeds the Earth is destroyed, of course Tommy Lee's character is so calm about the whole situation that you feel you have nothing to worry about. So for a funny movie that has great scenes of Will Smith training and becoming a Man in Black watch this film and do yourself a favor and skip part two...not that it was entirely bad, I liked it okay, but it just seems like an unnecessary sequel.

I wanted to rewatch this movie as part of a marathon of classics that I'm going through with my girlfriend and it was one of the first ones she suggested. I didn't remember much of the movie from the last time I've seen it but I knew it was good, or at least that's how I remembered it. So it was to my surprise that I found a ridiculous amount of plot holes, non-existent backstories, and many feeble attempts at creating a coherent and immersive world that would make you feel like it's actually real. It was especially shocking seeing as this movie is regarded as a timeless, iconic, classic, and that's I was left greatly disappointed. For example, Edwards, (or Agent J), had absolutely no back story whatsoever. We never learn about his family or loved ones or frankly anyone who even knew him. I mean the guy was NYPD for god's sakes. So it really felt like lazy writing when we were meant to believe that in order for Edwards to join MIB, he had to completely disappear from the world he once lived in. In addition, the ending felt rushed and the story, (which had the potential to be something special), came up lacking to say the least. But don't get me wrong, the movie had it's bright spots like it's humor and the chemistry between agents "J" and "K". However, it's really apparent how much potential this movie and it's story had so it's sad to see the final product not meet the expectations. All in all it was a decent watch a pretty good comedy to say the least. Would recommend if you're looking for a quick enjoyable watch.

"Men in Black" is a fast-paced action-comedy that over-achieves the whole way.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith make an amazing comedy team as the title characters who protect the Earth from the scum of the universe. Everything is tongue-in-cheek and the whole film works in a really great way.  A great film that benefits from its characters and amazing special effects.  4 out of 5 stars.

The less that we could say is that movies about extra-terrestrials are becoming more and more fashionable. It's certainly the most fertile period for alien movies since the '50s. At the time, these flicks were some kind of Cold War metaphors that promoted anti-communism and McCarthyism and were disguised as tales depicting an invasion from outer-space. Today, it's mainly a very valuable excuse for developing special effects and ultra-sophisticated animatronic creatures. Only, in the case that's picking our interest right now, there's something different.It must be specified beforehand that there are different kinds of alien movies. The first kind is the invasion film which dominated the silver screen in the middle of the twentieth century and which seems gaining in popularity since recent box-office successes like "Independence Day". The second kind is the benign alien movie a la "E.T." where space invaders are kindly and inoffensive and where humans look like a primitive form of life in the universe."Men in Black" belongs to a third type that we don't see much often. We could call it the alien comedy. It's a film genre that is not much approached and which releases even fewer great successes on the box-office side as well as on the critical side. There has been "Mars Attacks!", but critics didn't hook to that kind of iconoclast humor from Tim Burton. But with "MiB", they will get hooked for sure."Men in Black" stars the endlessly serious Tommy Lee Jones and the rising star Will Smith. Jones plays the role of K, a MiB agent, that is an organization which monitors extra-terrestrial activities on Earth. K hires Smith (re-named J) after he successfully pursued an alien in the streets of New York City.Their first mission together consists in recovering a galaxy (because it seems that the size doesn't have any importance) on 'Orion's Belt'. Their adversary is a 'bug disguised' as Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio) who is also searching for the galaxy. With the passing of the events lived by the two agents, we gradually discover the Men in Black world, their weapons, the different species of extra-terrestrials who live on Earth and what their job implies (and it's not included in any job guide...).It is hard to define what is the 'meat' of the movie. It could be the duo formed by the two principal actors, the futuristic gadgets which will make salivate those who have an eye on advanced technologies or it could also be the aliens, who are CG, played by actors with special costumes or remote-controlled. In fact, there's a little bit of all this. But I'd say that the most interesting moments are those which make the audience laugh wildly.In that case, it's Will Smith who's the best. In a performance that seems to be an evolution from his hot-shot role in "Independence Day", Smith is incredibly funny and wacky and he always provides good laughs, should it be for moments of physical comedy or when he makes the use of jokes and irony.And what could be better to complete a jester role than combining it with its total opposite? This fact makes that the movie enters in the category of 'odd couple' films. We must admit it, Jones plays his role with professionalism and his serious and his calm of stone give him a particular look in the tongue-in-cheek style. The sequence of the car in the tunnel with Elvis Presley's "Promised Land" playing in the background is the best example. In fact, the only moment where he laughs, it's when he tells a joke that is so appalling that the viewer could only laugh of him and not of his joke.I also fairly loved the famous segment where K and J's boss, Zed (Rip Torn), displays pictures of real-life people who are supposed to be aliens themselves. In the lot, I've spotted Steven Spielberg (I've always told myself that he had to be from another planet), Danny DeVito (who redefines the 'little green man' term) and Sylvester Stallone (who apparently had difficulties to get rid of his extra-terrestrial accent). And at the end of the movie, we also learn that Dennis Rodman would be an alien too, which wouldn't be too surprising for obvious reasons...I've been somehow muddled by Vincent D'Onofrio's performance. Was he really there during the entire movie moving in such a mechanical way? Or was he played by a giant-sized animated puppet by moments? Anyway, in both cases, we can only raise our hat.I wouldn't say the same thing for principal actress Linda Fiorentino who looked very annoying. The end of the movie is also ambiguous.Special effects are mentionable. Aliens, even if they are totally peculiar, are well-conceived, should it be with the help of computers or from Rick Baker's hand. It must be said that the fact that the story is an adaptation of a rather unknown comic series (which also proves that comics' adaptations do not always involve superheroes), there must be a special treatment that should be brought to the presentation because comics images are rather stylized. The final result is more than satisfying.In a genre not much approached like the sci-fi comedy genre, "Men in Black" is probably the greatest representative of it since "Ghostbusters" in 1984. It's a very funny thrill ride that you would want to see again and again...

After the horribly cheesy "Independence Day" of the previous year, it was great to see the actor that saved that movie from being completely unwatchable - Will Smith - get a chance to save the planet in a quality film. From the opening of the film where "Mikey", an illegal alien from another planet is disguised as an illegal alien from another country, to the end when we see the earth just as a marble in a pouch of many belonging to an extraterrestrial being, I found this film to be thought provoking, original, and very funny.Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) and Will Smith (Agent J) are perfect in their roles. Not since Lenny Briscoe and Mike Logan were partners on "Law and Order" has the young cop/old cop routine been done so well with such great chemistry and deadpan humor. All of the supporting roles work too. Rip Torn is great as Zed, the head of the secret government organization - the "Men In Black" - who are in charge of overseeing the visits of extraterrestrials who have chosen to establish contact with earth and in some cases become semi-permanent residents of this planet. His great one-liners include telling a group of rejected job applicants - who really don't know what kind of job they've applied for - "Congratulations gentlemen. You are all we've come to expect from years of government training".Some of the rank and file employees of the agency are aliens themselves. Unmotivated and not particularly loyal, they enjoy hanging out in the break room drinking coffee, smoking heavily, and collecting cheap miniatures of the Statue of Liberty. Vincent D'Onofrio is also outstanding in the dual role of Edgar, a human who gets eaten by a malicious alien cockroach, and also as the cockroach himself as he tools around New York City in his "brand new Edgar suit" - Edgar's skin - in an attempt to appear human while trying to start an intergalactic war.Any human who happens to encounter an alien won't remember it thanks to the neuralizer - a device the size of a fountain pen - that the "Men In Black" administer to erase any resulting memories. This includes employees of the agency themselves, should they choose to quit or retire. The underlying purpose of all of this covering up makes sense when Smith's character, during his orientation session, tells Tommy Lee Jones that he thinks that people could handle the truth about aliens living among them. Jones' (Agent K's) response is: "A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals and you know it." This is hard to argue with when you think about the acts that people throughout history have performed as a mob that they would never have done as individuals. I really enjoyed this film, and its smart humor has held up over the years. I think in the future many will wonder, as I still do, why this film didn't get a nod at the Academy Awards other than its award for best makeup, at the very least for the screenplay.

Yeah this movie was ok, but it wasn't one of the best movies i've seen. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are both good in the titles roles, but the movie itself has a plot line as thin as a piece of notebook paper, and some of the jokes aren't funny. Plus the dialogue is dumb. So i went to see this movie expecting to see a great movie, and I didn't. I give Men In Black a 5 out of 10. It was OK but not what it was hyped to be.

On the surface, a film featuring the straight-laced Tommy Lee Jones fighting aliens would seem to be a terrible idea. However, throw in some humor from Will Smith and some great filmmakers, and all of a sudden you have created a classic, genre-busting experience.For a basic plot summary, "Men in Black" sees Agent K (Jones) policing hidden aliens that constitute our planet unbeknownst to the general population. But, since K is starting to get a bit long in the tooth, he sets about bringing a little bit of new blood into the MIB organization, which is where James Edwards (Smith), an NYPD street cop, comes into the picture.The chemistry between Jones (the "straight man") and Smith (the "cutup") is what really makes this movie fun to watch. Their banter back and forth never stops from beginning to end and is always good for a chuckle.Of course, just the concept of the film alone is unique in and of itself. Though the potential for utter failure was quite high, director Barry Sonnenfield (with probably more than a little help from executive producer Steven Spielberg) manages to make the film take itself just seriously enough to work, not but not seriously enough to prevent a lot of fun from creeping into the screenplay.Overall, "Men in Black" is just a fun film that (in its day) was something completely new to the cinematic landscape. Unless you just really aren't into the often goofy nature of the movie, you will enjoy the special effects and witty banter thoroughly.

This was a fun movie with a few interesting ideas. The ending after the ending makes you think about the relativity of size, and it was cute.  It didnt take itself seriously which unfortunately ID4 and Lost in Space did. At 98 mins it is a little on the short side for current movies but I guess it is aimed at the short attention span of younger people.All the stars were good, Tommy Lee Jones plays Tommy Lee Jones with the usual staccato delivery and dry wit, Will Smith and his own brand of humour offsets TLJ nicely. Vincent D'Onofrio was brilliant as Edgar the bug. The loose skin thing worked really well.   I for one will be looking forward to the sequel.

I'm about 16 years late seeing this, and I saw the third one first (with no need for #2), but I must say that this is one of the most fun movie-watching experiences I've ever had. It was non-stop laughs and thrills from beginning to end. The element which stuck out to me as being done extraordinarily well was the writing, specifically the comic interplay between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Their characters are so different, and yet play off each other so well. Even the smaller parts were well-written and played. Of particular amusement to me was the largely physical performance given by Vincent D'Onofrio as the main bad bug. You can tell he gave it his all with his awkward speech patterns and movements. It really seemed like he was adjusting to a human body, and it was all done with a sly sense of humor. The only thing I find lacking was some dated CG, but considering it came out over 15 years ago, it was fine. If anything it adds to the B-movie charm, and some of alien design was probably influenced by 1950's "Creature Features" anyway. All things considered, it was an absolutely incredible and enthralling viewing experience. It's just a shame I waited so long to check it out.

This movie was good fun!It was one of those rare films that allowed you to take your brain out and play with it for a while.  While other films are just plain stupid, this film was charming.  It knew the secret:  if you're suspending believability, then DON'T TAKE YOURSELF TOO SERIOUSLY!!!This film had original and interesting moments that were neither predictable nor rehashed.  It had that quality which allowed you to have fun in a fanciful world.  It was extremely clever; not from scientific accuracy but from parody, subplot and humour.

This movie is simply so lovable, and it has affected many people who have seen it. Men In Black has such a nice atmosphere, and it's not gritty and dark as science fiction or fantasy written these days. How many people have seen this movie and were immediately (not entirely seriously) convinced aliens have visited us? When it's a movie like Men In Black, it's so much more fun believing aliens might exist. There are movies that make aliens seem like killing machines whose only purpose is to destroy human race OR they are the kind of wise creatures who are so much better than us. But the aliens in Men In Black are - apart from the villains - almost sympathetic. They seem nice and really ordinary. Most of the charm of this movie comes from Will Smith. He is a talented actor, and his experience in comedy such as Fresh Prince of Bel Air has given him the ability to deliver comedic lines wonderfully. For him they are natural, and while Tommy Lee Jones's character Kay doesn't get as many one-liners, said by him the feeling is different. The character Jay is exactly how many of us would like to be in a situation like this. Of course the aliens and secret organisations are all new to him and he is allowed to be openly confused, but he still seems extremely excited about everything instead of being too broody or too angry like most heroes in action. This movie was made in 1990s, and the effects aren't what we see in the theaters these days, but they are still pretty damn amazing. When we are used to see the extremely beautiful science fiction, something as simple as Men In Black is a nice change. Men In Black is simple science fiction comedy. It's a movie that made me like science fiction, and is still probably the reason I'm not into the kind of science fiction where everything is in space and where you can see the filmmakers tried way too hard. Men In Black has a quite simple setting, quite simple plots and ordinary characters. Jay could be anyone of us, chosen by almost randomly instead of having some kind of great destiny. This is what science fiction needs to revisit. This is amazing.

With Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith leading the way, this proved to be a rather entertaining movie about a secret alien society. Granted, true followers of the men in black know this stylized version of the secret organization is not true, but it is still interesting to watch. While I have never cared much for Barry Sonnenfeld's body of work, his fast paced cinematography works hand in hand with this movie, moving the viewer along at a pace which keeps them interested all throughout. Also, the creature effects were top notch, which I feel was the real scene stealer in the film. Tommy Lee Jones was exceptional, but Will Smith proved to be mostly annoying. Overall, the oddball nature of the film was rather satisfying.

slick and boring. glitz and mud. a smart action movie is too much to ask for i guess. the movie falls somewhere betewen being a smart funny movie and a smart action flick and falls in the stupid neither category.will smith looks stylish enough to carry it all off. there are a lot of funny bits, assuming you havent dozed off, u might catch them.good luck.a 5 for nothingness
