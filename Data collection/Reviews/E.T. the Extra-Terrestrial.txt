E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL was one of those films that everybody took for granted as a child in the 1980s. Everybody had seen it, everybody loved it, everybody could reference it with the other kids knowing what they were talking about. Finding myself less than impressed than Steven Spielberg's overt sentimentalism, I wondered how I'd find it as an adult...Well, I needn't have worried, because E.T. still hits the mark. Yes, it's mawkish and rather dated, but I think that's all part of the fun. This is the classic kid's film of the 1980s, in which the adults are portrayed as either out of touch or the enemy; it's the kids who have to band together to fight for justice, and the template works very well here.Inevitably, the character of E.T. himself is what makes this film. The Carlo Rambaldi special effects still stand the test of time and the voice mannerisms are just right. Henry Thomas has a tough role, acting against an non-human for the most part, but he excels in the part and the frog scene is still excellent. Drew Barrymore is very effective too. E.T. is certainly a film that still manages to tug at the heartstrings with all of the increasing drama and that poignant ending, and I love it just as much as I always did.

Spielberg's powerful and remarkable film about a boy and his unusual befriendment of an extra terrestrial. Possibly his finest film, E.T. captures a piece of childhood, and reminds the rest of us of a time long since past. It excites a story adults often forget, and a powerful remembrance of a childhood friendship during difficult periods of development. Adult criticism of the movie loses its youthful bond, and fails to appreciate growing up in the 80's. This is the pinnacle of Spielberg's childhood movies. Few other films capture as powerful a message of childhood emotion. Other films which attempt to do so dive so deep into childhood memories they lose their connection with adults, and degrade to brief interludes of "dumb" comic relief to keep grown ups from falling asleep. The closest runner up is likely Goonies (a film written by Spielberg). A very personal film for Spielberg; as he explores atypical friendships after the separation of his father; he should be commended for achieving such a remarkable success and for sharing it with the rest of us. I was five when I first saw the movie, and although it frightened me at the time, it still makes me cry. An unparalleled film in its class, it is easy to see why it remains the fourth all time grossing film (adjusted for inflation, third otherwise) seventeen years after its release. Cheers to Spielberg for not ruining the movie by attempting a sequel.

This is Spielberg at his best. That is all I can say about E.T. IT's gripping, intelligent story mixed with its incredible symbolism makes it one of the best films ever made. E.T. is a story about friendship, loyalty, and family. But most of all it is about love, and how powerful love is. The brilliantly innovative shots mixed with John William's epic score makes for a masterpiece, which E.T. certainly is. The underlying theme of science vs. religion is also what makes the film great. All of these things mesh together to form the film that "touched millions of people around the world." Everything about this film is great. Steven Spielberg pulls off some legendary shots, and the acting from the children is excellent. It makes the film truly real. Henry Thomas as Elliot is great. Drew Barrymoore is so cute throughout he whole film and she captures the audience every time she appears on screen. Peter Coyote does great with the minimal screen time they chose to give him. The relationship between E.T. and Elliot can be marked as one of the greatest friendships in Hollywood history, and if you have not seen this film I urge you to rent it or see it somehow as soon as possible. If you want to see why everyone raves about Spielberg being the greatest director of all time see this film. It truly shows him at his best. It will not only make you laugh and make you smile, but it will touch your heart deeper than any movie has touched you before. E.T. will go down as one of the greatest films as all time. Its timelessness is one of a kind. Forget what you hear about it being overrated. See it for yourself and understand why this film is apart of a small collection of films that will stay in our hearts forever and ever.

Went to E. T. when it came out in 82. Wonderfully sobbed my heart out. Watched it tonight 2021, sobbed my heart out.

Today when I was at my house alone, looking through my DVDs, trying to figure out which movie I should see for entertainment. I saw E.T and I hadn't seen it for nearly 3-4 years ago. I seen the film ever since I was 4 years old, so I wondering if I would still enjoy it when I'm an adult. As I was watching the film, I had this rush of nostalgia running through me, I was remembering the times when I was a kid with my family. The film didn't at all feel to childish to me, I was actually having a lot of fun, like I used to when I was a kid. This film has not aged at all since 30 years ago. This film is a truly timeless film, and will always be remembered. This is one of the best Steven Spielberg films. (And that is no easy task) A Timeless Classic 10/10

The classic of family classics, 'E.T.' is a wonderful and heartfelt portrait of childhood exploring the friendship between Elliot, a young boy living in California, and an extra-terrestrial who gets accidentally left behind by his spaceship. From the multiple viewings during my childhood to the nostalgic sense of warmth I get from watching it nowadays, there is no way I can fault this science fiction masterpiece. One of Spielberg's greatest films, 'E.T.' is a compassionate and emotionally-driven tale packed with clever storytelling, bold direction and state-of-the-art visual effects.. oh and it also features one of the most iconic images in cinema history. A remarkable adventure that acts as both a touching family drama and an exciting sci-fi flick, and one that needs to be seen by all.

Whilst visiting Earth an Alien is accidentally left behind and strikes up a friendship with a young boy.The story centres around E.T. and his relationship with three children in a family where the parents are divorced and the father is not around. Much has been written about how autobiographical the movie is about Spielberg's own childhood and lots of unique little moments along these lines are captured in the most cinematic way possible. In fact some of the strongest scenes involve simple interaction between the family and their friends. These are not idealised Hollywood versions of families, but natural slices of suburban life that always feel real.E.T.'s arrival and the events that follow help to fill the emptiness in the heart of the youngest son Elliott and they soon form a psychic bond together. Peace, tolerance and communication are explored constantly as we see visuals and hear dialogue connected to these themes throughout the movie.We see everything from E.T.'s perspective and share his experience as an alien visitor in a strange world. Nothing is explained, because what we see with our own eyes tells us everything we need to know. In fact the visuals are so powerful there was very little I had to explain to my three year old companion as she watched it with me.Everything builds towards a spectacular climax, which is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Again very little is said as this wonderfully emotional sequence very efficiently breaks our hearts.I didn't care much for E.T. during the 80s. I think it's because I was conditioned from a very young age by more violent and action orientated movies. Also, my mother was quite enthusiastic about it which back then could scrape the cool off most things. It was not until I was pushing forty with a three year old daughter that my perspective changed forever.Well done Mr Spielberg, probably your finest moment.

But I still have to say, I didn't really like it very much, and I thought I did. Before watching it, I came by and read some reviews - a lot of people seemed to think it was wonderful. And no matter whether the commenters liked it or not, the consensus was that it's a "kids" thing and that it's sentimental, both which happened to sound very appealing to me, so that I even overlooked the cynics' comments. I mean, I like kid's movies like Home Alone, and I'm a sentimental schmuck - I loved Heart and Souls. SO I decided to watch this thinking I wouldn't be disappointed.I was disappointed. I'm still not sure why. The movie sort of dragged, making me feel bored. And I found myself way too detached from the movie than I was supposed to be. A very bad experience which proves this: I was watching this scene with the flying bike, the music was beautiful and soaring, and I was saying to myself, "Now this is supposed to be a great moment," and I repeated some comment like that too at the last few scenes of the movie. The problem was, the moment I thought that, I knew whatever great moment it was supposed to be, I didn't feel that way. And that was how the whole movie was for me.

I still can't believe this came out in 1982. It looks like it was made a lot later with better technology.. I mean 1982 had some real old lookin stinkers and E.T. was so ahead of it's time, back when Spielberg was in his prime!! I remember seeing this at the theater multiple times and I was born in December of 1977 so I couldn't have been any older than 4! I am watching it with my two girls as I type this. They are ages 10 and 8 and they are absolutely mesmerized lol.. also I'd like to point out the GREAT acting especially by Henry Thomas (Elliot). If you ever get a chance to look on YouTube, look up his original audition for this movie. It'll blow you away.. Anyway, E.T. is a timeless classic not to ever be forgotten. The people rating it a 1 who are saying it was boring need to stick with their "Transformers" movies lol

Continuing my plan to watch every Steven Spielberg movie in order, I come to E.T.Alongside Field Of Dreams, this is a movie guaranteed to make me cry every single time I watch it. I don't know what it is, but I automatically become 5 years old every time I watch it. It is seriously flawed (My 12-year-old ripped it to shreds) but I can't hate anything about it. Lots more product placement and Daddy issuesThe end of the film was one of the most significant musical experiences for John Willims. After several attempts were made to match the score to the film, Spielberg took the film off the screen and told Williams to conduct the orchestra the way he would at a concert. He did, and Spielberg re-edited the film to match the music, which is unusual since the music is normally edited to match the film. The result was Williams deservedly winning the 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Score.E.T was the number 1 movie of 1982, as it grossed $359 million at the domestic box office (beating Tootise (2nd) an Officer & A Gentleman (3rd) and Rocky 3 (4th). Giving Spielberg back to back number 1's and his third no 1 movie of the year, making him the most successful (box office wise) of all the people I have done this for.

The eighties were a period where Spielberg began going through a transformation. By the time the nineties had arrived he had lost the plot due to his ridiculous sized budgets. In 1982 E.T. just managed to escape most of the Spielster's new ways. E.T. was fairly well made and very emotional to the young viewers, and even some of the older viewers. I couldn't describe it as magical, but instead a bit of fun. The references to Star Wars were the highlight for me.This time a 7 out of 10 for the Spielster.

I dislike E.T. because ever time I watch it, I feel like I'm being emotionally manipulated by a series of cutesy images, plot mechanisms that defy logic, and a score that is WAY over the top.E.T. is supposed to be an intelligent being, capable of interstellar travel, but in this movie, he is relegated to the role, basically, of a child, and acts as such. I guess that's part of the point of the movie: the parallels between E.T. and Elliot (yes, I know: Elliot's initials are ET). That they are each lost and lonely, one in his own world, the other in a place far from home. But even understanding that does not make this movie any more palatable to me.  I guess I wanted a more mature treatment of the little guy.An example of the plot doing this movie in for me is arguably the most famous scene from this movie: the flying bicycles. The whole movie E.T. has presumably been in great danger of discovery, and is apparently unable to help himself. But when he and the kids are being chased on their bikes, not only is he able to levitate Elliot's bike, but all the rest of them, too! Sorry, but my reaction to that was `Where the HECK did that come from?' (For the record, and so you don't think I'm completely heartless, I do love the image of the bikes in front of the moon).Lastly is John Williams' overpowering score. When I listen to his music as part of a movie, I feel like I'm being hit over the head with a sledgehammer.All right, so I'm an ogre for not liking E.T., and my children will doubtless grow up to be delinquents, but it's the way I feel.  I do think he took the easy way out in creating something with broad appeal: he did it not through character development and growth, but through a series of cute images and gimmicks.

E.T. is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie blew me out of my seat as a kid, and still kills me every time I watch it. Only four or five movies have made me cry, much less sob uncontrollably. When I returned from seeing E.T. for the first time, I couldn't talk for the rest of the day. I laid in my bed and cried for about five hours.The movie still makes tears well up in my eyes and gives me a lump in my throat. I still find it profoundly moving. It's heart-breakingly sad, yet phenomenally uplifting at the same time. I had no idea a movie could be so powerful when I saw this in the movies for the first time when I was eleven.What I think makes E.T. so powerful for me now is the heart-wrenching way it has of making me long to be a kid again. I refuse to ever completely grow up, and my memories are my own, but man does this movie make me wish I was eleven again, when riding my bike was a pleasure, Matchbox cars were the greatest thing in the world, Halloween was a night of mystery and creepy fun I looked forward to all year, going to the movies was an adventure, and looking up at the stars could be a mind-blowing experience.E.T. keeps those feeling alive for me. So do a lot of other things, but E.T. is the champ. As much as my cynical adult side may want to slap Steven Spielberg around sometimes, I would happily give him a hug for his timeless gift to the world, E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL.

This might be the most perfect 80s movie out there. The score is on point as usual from John Williams and the kid actors are absolutely amazing. Spielberg is just a genius at just about everything he does. This movie just makes me smile every time I watch it.

Without doubt the greatest family movie ever made. I remember like yesterday seeing this in the cinema aged 9, and nearly 40 years later it still makes me laugh, smile and cry.There are wonderful moments all the way throughout the movie and every child should see this movie at some point in their life. Yes the effects are not like the ones these days, but the story telling and warm feeling it gives you inside will give you something to cherish for ever.ET is magical in every sense of the word and will touch your heart like nothing else.

Review:
'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is a science-fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg.
After a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas). Bringing the extraterrestrial into his suburban California house, Elliott introduces E.T., as the alien is dubbed, to his brother and his little sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore), and the children decide to keep its existence a secret. Soon, however, E.T. falls ill, resulting in government intervention and a dire situation for both Elliott and the alien.
E.T. is still consider one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's not hard to understand why. I just recently watched this again with my 7-yeard-old and we both had a very good time. This is a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy.
The overall acting was pretty good for it being a movie from the early 80's. I mean let's face it the stories were better and original back then, but the acting has come a long way. However, Spielberg pulled out a brilliant child performance from Henry Thomas. He did an amazing job as the main lead Elliot. You can watch his audition tape on YouTube and it's not hard to see why he got the job.
With Spielberg behind the camera, there was no way that people did not see that this was a success waiting to happen. The man does Science Fiction the way no other director can or at least has accomplished. He had three major success stories prior to E.T (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark) so having yet another brilliant success right afterwards basically cemented his name in Hollywood. The way he shoots this movie is breathtaking with a lot of wide angled takes.
Overall, this movie is just brilliant. I know there are some people that don't believe it aged well and think E.T is just creepy and don't really by into the story. But I do. I buy every single bit of it. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves to sit down and watch a beautiful story about friendship, and how far some will go to help an individual in need.
5/5

There are those times when all the forces at work come together and you have a masterpiece. This, of course, is a kids' movie. Obviously, it is so much more. It is a story of love and heart and character. To begin with, as a middle school teacher, I can attest to the wonderful casting and writing. It doesn't insult us. It shows us how a person who knows the heart of humanity (and that extends to the alien nation) can transcend cliché and put forth a beautiful story--but not a lightweight one by any means. The adults make up the periphery. The childlike quality of the lovable alien could only be appreciated and cared for by those who have not become as jaded as they. As soon as those adult figures show up, everyone is in trouble. Yet, for the most part, they have good intentions. The government agents are another issue. They bring force and death.Who hasn't seen this. There are series of episodes that have become part of our cultural landscape. Words have been brought into our language. We speak along with Elliot and ET. Halloween, phoning home, frogs all over the lab, hiding in the closet among the stuffed animals, the bike ride where the bikes suddenly leave the ground, the touching of the finger and the heart. It's just magical. Sometimes when one sees a movie, one begins to say, "If only they had done this or that." I can't think of anything in this film. Why write this review. Just to include my two cents' worth.

This is another blockbuster film of 25 years ago that is well-remembered but doesn't quite have the impact on multiple viewings and in years that have come-and-gone since 1982. Some movies still have a stunning impact, like Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyseey," or Spielberg's "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind," or even Scott's "Alien," but this sci-fi/alien movie seems to have lost its impact. Maybe it's just me, getting to be a cranky old man.It's still a cute show and one kids would like, except with the part where E.T. is close to death. This is another Steven Spielberg film in which the kids are smarter than the adults...and the adults are always the bad guys. He had that in a number of his popular films and I hope he is finally through with that tiresome nonsense. Maybe he actually learned that adults are smarter than six-year-olds (generally-speaking!).I got a kick out of this movie at the theater in 1982, but now it just looks too corny, manipulative and an insult to any adult's intelligence.

ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Screw E.T.  Why is this movie praised so much?  It's pure garbage.  ET is an a**hole.  Why?  Because he was out in the forest lolly-gaggin' when his superiors were calling him back to his ship.  He was careless and missed the boat!  Simple as that.  And instead of being a man and paying the price for his own mistakes, he lays this guilt trip on all us humans and begs us to help him get back home.  Now it's our problem.  What a jerk!  Sorry, ET but I got my own problems.  What were you doing out there in the woods anyway? Probably devising some elaborate alien conspiracy that will baffle the minds of millions of society's greatest analysts for the next thousand generations.  I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.  Period.And once he gets here, look what he does.  He makes Elliot (the only one who loved him) sick.  So sick, in fact, he is near death.  If ET can touch a flower and bring it back to life, why doesn't he touch the boy who is doing his best to help him???  Elliot is really bustin' his ass for this punk alien.  He's telling his mother boldface lies, he is missing days at school, he becomes a part time wino, he gets a police rap sheet, quarantined from his neighborhood, then chased and shot at by the FBI.  All for this ingrate named ET, who never even gives so much as a thank you.  This is the thanks I get?  I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.I purchased the ET Scholastic book when I was in 2nd grade.  There, it stated that ET is 300 light years away from his home.  I don't think people realize how far that is.  A light year is the distance the speed of light travels during the course of 1 year.  The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.  Now there are 86,400 seconds in just one day, which means the distance of the speed of light is 148,800,000,000 miles in a day.  This number multiplied by the number of days in a year (365) brings us to 54,312,000,000,000.  This is the distance light travels (in miles) in just one year.  I repeat ONE year.  Now then, ET is 300 light years away from his home planet?  Fine.  There are 109,500 days in 300 years.  Which means the total mileage of how far ET's home from Earth is 10,346,436,000,000,000,000. I know these are all just mind numbing figures to you, so to put it in greater perspective, ET had to begin his journey to Earth about 10 trillion years before the first dinosaur was created in order to get here by 1982, the year of the movie's release.  And Elliot made contact with his home with a friggin' Speak-N-Spell.This movie is so stupid.  How ET even has the balls to ask his homies to COME BACK and get him a second time is beyond me.  The speed of sound is even slower than light, so Elliot should have been about 20 trillion years old before the aliens even GOT the signal.  Then another approximate 47 trillion years later (not counting rest stops and space tolls) before they actually arrive to get ET.  Elliot would be an old man by the time they got back.As for the movie itself, it introduces some of the dumbest characters I have ever seen in a movie.  During Halloween, the kids throw a sheet over ET and Dee Wallace doesn't even notice her own child is a foot shorter and her head's 10 pounds heavier.  Then when they go trick or treating, ET mistakes a kid dressed as Yoda as one of his hometown natives.  How stupid is this alien?  He's smart enough to learn English in 2 hours but can't tell a kid in a costume.  Yoda's from Dagobah, for Christ's sake!  He looks nothing like ET.  Even I can tell the difference and I've never even been to Dagobah.  ET must be the Rain Man of his planet.  The more I watch the movie, the more I realize how autistic ET is.  He even enjoyed it when Drew Barrymore had her way with him and turned him into a cross dresser.I really like the end sequence when all the kids put masks over their faces during the big FBI chase.  Is Spielberg that stingy with his money that he couldn't afford stunt look alikes?  So instead he'll save a buck by hiding their faces so we can't see them, but never mind the fact that each kid grows 2 feet taller and 20 pounds heavier.  And after they all fly, how corny was their landing?  Perfect formation, BMX style!  Hahaha!  It looked like a deleted scene from that movie Rad.So, yes, ET is a bad movie.  Crap special effects, crap acting, crap story. It wasn't even half as good as Mac and Me.  ET is not fun for the entire family, as most believe it to be.  Fun for the whole family is a movie like Animal House.  Kids like d*ck and fart jokes, trust me.  Not some kid hugging a nightmare inducing creature with his heart pumpin' on the outside. How scary was that?  I tell, you, one day the sequel will come out and you will all see I was right.  ET is evil.  Just like every other alien in every other movie.  After Close Encounters, Independence Day, and V.....I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.Zero stars out of 5.

This movie really disgusted me. But let me explain....It is not that I don't believe in sentimentality. I am a HUGE Frank Capra fan. And I can't watch "Field of Dreams" (which I know isn't Capra) without tears in my eyes at many points in the movie. So that isn't it. It's just that "E.T." is so phony, so synthetic, so made-up, so ENGINEERED to try to make me feel something, that I have to resent it. I'll just never understand Spielberg. For so long, I had nothing but contempt for him. Till Schindler's List. (Does anyone (other than Nazis) not like Schindler's List?) And then, too, he made Saturday-morning worth getting up for. (Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain). I finally (and grudgingly) had to admit that the man is a genius. But he is a genius who has done some bad work. And E.T. was some of his worst work.

E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL was one of those films that everybody took for granted as a child in the 1980s. Everybody had seen it, everybody loved it, everybody could reference it with the other kids knowing what they were talking about. Finding myself less than impressed than Steven Spielberg's overt sentimentalism, I wondered how I'd find it as an adult...Well, I needn't have worried, because E.T. still hits the mark. Yes, it's mawkish and rather dated, but I think that's all part of the fun. This is the classic kid's film of the 1980s, in which the adults are portrayed as either out of touch or the enemy; it's the kids who have to band together to fight for justice, and the template works very well here.Inevitably, the character of E.T. himself is what makes this film. The Carlo Rambaldi special effects still stand the test of time and the voice mannerisms are just right. Henry Thomas has a tough role, acting against an non-human for the most part, but he excels in the part and the frog scene is still excellent. Drew Barrymore is very effective too. E.T. is certainly a film that still manages to tug at the heartstrings with all of the increasing drama and that poignant ending, and I love it just as much as I always did.

Spielberg's powerful and remarkable film about a boy and his unusual befriendment of an extra terrestrial. Possibly his finest film, E.T. captures a piece of childhood, and reminds the rest of us of a time long since past.

An unparalleled film in its class, it is easy to see why it remains the fourth all time grossing film (adjusted for inflation, third otherwise) seventeen years after its release. Cheers to Spielberg for not ruining the movie by attempting a sequel.

This is Spielberg at his best. That is all I can say about E.T. IT's gripping, intelligent story mixed with its incredible symbolism makes it one of the best films ever made.

The relationship between E.T. and Elliot can be marked as one of the greatest friendships in Hollywood history, and if you have not seen this film I urge you to rent it or see it somehow as soon as possible. If you want to see why everyone raves about Spielberg being the greatest director of all time see this film. It truly shows him at his best. It will not only make you laugh and make you smile, but it will touch your heart deeper than any movie has touched you before. E.T. will go down as one of the greatest films as all time. Its timelessness is one of a kind. Forget what you hear about it being overrated. See it for yourself and understand why this film is apart of a small collection of films that will stay in our hearts forever and ever.

Went to E. T. when it came out in 82. Wonderfully sobbed my heart out. Watched it tonight 2021, sobbed my heart out.

Today when I was at my house alone, looking through my DVDs, trying to figure out which movie I should see for entertainment. I saw E.T and I hadn't seen it for nearly 3-4 years ago. I seen the film ever since I was 4 years old, so I wondering if I would still enjoy it when I'm an adult.

Again very little is said as this wonderfully emotional sequence very efficiently breaks our hearts.I didn't care much for E.T. during the 80s. I think it's because I was conditioned from a very young age by more violent and action orientated movies. Also, my mother was quite enthusiastic about it which back then could scrape the cool off most things. It was not until I was pushing forty with a three year old daughter that my perspective changed forever.Well done Mr Spielberg, probably your finest moment.

E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL, in my opinion, is a very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart and make you cry. I really loved the magic that E.T. performed. If I could have, I would have helped him get to safety myself. The only problem is how I would get him to safety, since I can't drive. The score was good, the costumes were perfectly designed, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it.

But I still have to say, I didn't really like it very much, and I thought I did. Before watching it, I came by and read some reviews - a lot of people seemed to think it was wonderful. And no matter whether the commenters liked it or not, the consensus was that it's a "kids" thing and that it's sentimental, both which happened to sound very appealing to me, so that I even overlooked the cynics' comments. I mean, I like kid's movies like Home Alone, and I'm a sentimental schmuck - I loved Heart and Souls. SO I decided to watch this thinking I wouldn't be disappointed.I was disappointed. I'm still not sure why. The movie sort of dragged, making me feel bored. And I found myself way too detached from the movie than I was supposed to be. A very bad experience which proves this: I was watching this scene with the flying bike, the music was beautiful and soaring, and I was saying to myself, "Now this is supposed to be a great moment," and I repeated some comment like that too at the last few scenes of the movie. The problem was, the moment I thought that, I knew whatever great moment it was supposed to be, I didn't feel that way. And that was how the whole movie was for me.

I still can't believe this came out in 1982. It looks like it was made a lot later with better technology.. I mean 1982 had some real old lookin stinkers and E.T. was so ahead of it's time, back when Spielberg was in his prime!! I remember seeing this at the theater multiple times and I was born in December of 1977 so I couldn't have been any older than 4! I am watching it with my two girls as I type this. They are ages 10 and 8 and they are absolutely mesmerized lol.. also I'd like to point out the GREAT acting especially by Henry Thomas (Elliot). If you ever get a chance to look on YouTube, look up his original audition for this movie. It'll blow you away.. Anyway, E.T. is a timeless classic not to ever be forgotten. The people rating it a 1 who are saying it was boring need to stick with their "Transformers" movies lol

I haven't seen this film since the late eighties at least, perhaps not since around the time it came out. And I must admit it was better than I expected. I didn't watch the new remastered director's cut that just came out recently, but instead borrowed the original, to see it as it was (I'm not really interested in cut scenes, etc.)The effects were vintage ILM, very nice for the time. E.T. looks pretty impressive, even by today's standards it isn't at all bad. Drew Barrymore is adorable, and I liked the older brother. In fact, Elliott is the only character that annoys me, with his shrieking and whining constantly...I admit, I'm fairly prejudiced against anyone younger than 14 in a film (as I rarely see any character at that age that isn't nauseatingly precious or irritating as heck) and this kid was no exception.Scenes that stood out in my mind include the wonderful frog rescue scene, and the classic bike rides (especially the chase one). But unfortunately, I feel the film drags on much too long, and the entire illness stretch just seems to go on forever. The government agents also seem rather unbelievable as well as overly inept and less covert thatn I think they should be. Though this is a children's film, so some silliness and suspension of disbelief is necessary. Still, as a whole I think the film is overrated. Great for kids (though not too young - I can see young children easily frightened by certain scenes), and heartwarming, some cool effects and a message for all about friendship and loyalty is strongly apparent. But still, a bit too silly at times, and the length gets tedious a bit towards the end. Great to watch, but I don't think it's the masterpiece many claim it to be. 7/10.

Continuing my plan to watch every Steven Spielberg movie in order, I come to E.T.Alongside Field Of Dreams, this is a movie guaranteed to make me cry every single time I watch it. I don't know what it is, but I automatically become 5 years old every time I watch it. It is seriously flawed (My 12-year-old ripped it to shreds) but I can't hate anything about it. Lots more product placement and Daddy issuesThe end of the film was one of the most significant musical experiences for John Willims. After several attempts were made to match the score to the film, Spielberg took the film off the screen and told Williams to conduct the orchestra the way he would at a concert. He did, and Spielberg re-edited the film to match the music, which is unusual since the music is normally edited to match the film. The result was Williams deservedly winning the 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Score.E.T was the number 1 movie of 1982, as it grossed $359 million at the domestic box office (beating Tootise (2nd) an Officer & A Gentleman (3rd) and Rocky 3 (4th). Giving Spielberg back to back number 1's and his third no 1 movie of the year, making him the most successful (box office wise) of all the people I have done this for.

The eighties were a period where Spielberg began going through a transformation. By the time the nineties had arrived he had lost the plot due to his ridiculous sized budgets. In 1982 E.T. just managed to escape most of the Spielster's new ways. E.T. was fairly well made and very emotional to the young viewers, and even some of the older viewers. I couldn't describe it as magical, but instead a bit of fun. The references to Star Wars were the highlight for me.This time a 7 out of 10 for the Spielster.

I dislike E.T. because ever time I watch it, I feel like I'm being emotionally manipulated by a series of cutesy images, plot mechanisms that defy logic, and a score that is WAY over the top.E.T. is supposed to be an intelligent being, capable of interstellar travel, but in this movie, he is relegated to the role, basically, of a child, and acts as such. I guess that's part of the point of the movie: the parallels between E.T. and Elliot (yes, I know: Elliot's initials are ET). That they are each lost and lonely, one in his own world, the other in a place far from home. But even understanding that does not make this movie any more palatable to me.  I guess I wanted a more mature treatment of the little guy.An example of the plot doing this movie in for me is arguably the most famous scene from this movie: the flying bicycles. The whole movie E.T. has presumably been in great danger of discovery, and is apparently unable to help himself. But when he and the kids are being chased on their bikes, not only is he able to levitate Elliot's bike, but all the rest of them, too! Sorry, but my reaction to that was `Where the HECK did that come from?' (For the record, and so you don't think I'm completely heartless, I do love the image of the bikes in front of the moon).Lastly is John Williams' overpowering score. When I listen to his music as part of a movie, I feel like I'm being hit over the head with a sledgehammer.All right, so I'm an ogre for not liking E.T., and my children will doubtless grow up to be delinquents, but it's the way I feel.  I do think he took the easy way out in creating something with broad appeal: he did it not through character development and growth, but through a series of cute images and gimmicks.

E.T. is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie blew me out of my seat as a kid, and still kills me every time I watch it. Only four or five movies have made me cry, much less sob uncontrollably. When I returned from seeing E.T. for the first time, I couldn't talk for the rest of the day. I laid in my bed and cried for about five hours.The movie still makes tears well up in my eyes and gives me a lump in my throat. I still find it profoundly moving. It's heart-breakingly sad, yet phenomenally uplifting at the same time. I had no idea a movie could be so powerful when I saw this in the movies for the first time when I was eleven.What I think makes E.T. so powerful for me now is the heart-wrenching way it has of making me long to be a kid again. I refuse to ever completely grow up, and my memories are my own, but man does this movie make me wish I was eleven again, when riding my bike was a pleasure, Matchbox cars were the greatest thing in the world, Halloween was a night of mystery and creepy fun I looked forward to all year, going to the movies was an adventure, and looking up at the stars could be a mind-blowing experience.E.T. keeps those feeling alive for me. So do a lot of other things, but E.T. is the champ. As much as my cynical adult side may want to slap Steven Spielberg around sometimes, I would happily give him a hug for his timeless gift to the world, E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL.

Everyone gets lost in nostalgia from time to time.  Many of us vividly recall the days when the most important thing you had to do that afternoon was find a place to stay cool or to make sure that all of your friends were willing to go on whatever adventure you wanted to embark on.  For me, those days were the years between 1980 and 1987.  At this time I was between the ages of 8 and 15.  This was a time when some of the greatest movies were ever made for a teenaged boy.  The genesis of film was started in my life with films like First Blood, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, The Goonies, Back To The Future and of course E.T.
Being that movies were such an intricate part of my young life and these experiences shaped me into the man that I am today, it is easy to recall with reverence the entire experience that went with those films.  E.T. is a rare film however, because it is an experience that just gets better with age.There was a theater in Windsor Ontario, where I spent my youth called the Vanity, located on Oullette Street, right near Wyandotte.  This one theater was the place to be when the blockbsuters arrived.  It was a one celled theater that managed to flourish in a time which pre-dated multi plexes with arcades and Pizza Hut's.When the sequel to Star Wars arrived, the Vanity proudly played it.  Same with Raiders and it's sequels and of course E.T.  E.T. was a film that me and my best friend Gary had to see because it was Spielberg.  Even though we were ten years old, we knew that Spielberg had given us great films like Jaws, Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I am not sure if it is normal at the age of ten but we rushed out to see E.T. because we knew who directed it.  What a phenom this tiny film turned out to be and what a life changing experience the whole film was.When you are ten and you see a movie with your best friend who watches the A-Team and Conan the Barbarian with you, you expect a certain reaction from him.  After all, this same friend enjoys playing football at lunch and enjoys inflicting pain in a barbaric pasttime called the "The Tripping Game", therefore you don't expect a film to affect you and your macho friend the way E.T. did.  When you are ten, you go to the movies to see things like lightsabre duels and heroes with bullwhips being lowered into the Well of the Souls and maybe the occasional breast shot.  What you don't expect is a film to manipulate your emotional realm thh way E.T. did and still does. Most of my friends who saw E.T. bawled their eyes out at the age of ten. I, for some unexplainable reason did not.  I loved the film but it wouldn't be for another six years that I cried in my first film.  That was She's Having A Baby when Kate Bush sang Woman's Work and made me sob uncontrollably as I watched Kevin Bacon lose his unborn child.  Some things can't be explained.E.T. became one of my favourite films and I saw it again on its re-release in 1985, bought the poster, purchased the movie on VHS and told everyone who would listen that E.T. got robbed at the 82 Oscars when it lost every major category to (snicker snicker) Gandhi.  There have been some Oscar travesties but this ( along with Annie Hall defeating Star Wars and Cuckoo's Nest beating Jaws ) had to be up there as one of the most ridiculous snubs ever. I was peeved.  What a joke.  But all of the cranky and derelict academy members seethed with contempt and jealousy because they couldn't accept the fact that a man this young could really be this much of a genius.  In fact he made the rest of the folks in Hollywood look young compared to himself.As the years passed I became a film lover, a movie buff and I tried to see any and every film out there.  And I did.  It's not that E.T. became an after-thought, it's just that it became one of those films that just sat it my collection and wasn't utilized often enough.  When I made my revised top 25 list, E.T. would always hover around number 20.  That is not an indictment of the quality of E.T., it's just that my tastes became more garnered to horror films and the sheer brilliance of E.T. was stored in the catacombs of my mind.  That all changed on March 24th, 2002.  This is ironic because my wife and I had the whole day planned.  We were going to see E.T. at the theater and then come home and watch the 24 hour Oscar-a-thon.  And in a year when an inferior film like A Beautiful Mind takes top honours from the much more ambitious and deserving Lord of the Rings, it reminded me of 20 years ago.  I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same.Seeing E.T. after a 17 year hiatus was nothing short of uplifting.  My excitement was gushing and when John Williams' ever recognizable score reverberated over the sound system, I was hooked and it felt like I was ten all over again.  I also noticed that the audience was an eclectic mix of young kids, 30 somethings like myself and the elderly.  All of us were there because we either wanted to experience it for the first time or because we wanted to feel what it was like that first time we saw it 20 years ago.I think I liked E.T. when I was ten but this time around I developed a deep level of respect for it.  E.T. is simply one of the finest films ever made and if you have not seen the film in the theater then you have no idea what you are missing.  Everything about this film is perfect, and there really aren't many films around I can say that about.  Even some of my personal favourites have moments of weakness but not E.T.  There has never really been another movie that has offered the experience that E.T. does.  And when I said that I didn't shed a tear while watching E.T., that has all changed. I think there were about five moments in E.T. that had me holding back the tears.  You can analyze the film, psychologically deconstruct it and tell me that the reason the film works so well is because of the feeling of loneliness and comradery and I will agree with you.  But I don't really care about that.  What it comes down to is that E.T. is a film that will touch you in a way that no other film before could do and no other film after it can.  1982 was a different time for film and it was a different time as a civilization.  And E.T. encompassed all of that.  If I had to make my revised top 25 list, E.T. would be number 2, right behind Jaws and ahead of JFK, Halloween, American Beauty and Raiders of the Lost Ark.If you have not seen E.T. at the theaters since 1985, please I urge you, go see it again.  It is a film experience that is indefeasible.  It is also a film that should be looked upon as a paradigm for which all movies should try to emulate.  There is a reason that films like E.T. and Star Wars and Raiders make the money they do.  And there is also a reason they stay firmly planted in our memories.  That is because they mean something and they stand for something.  Those are the qualities in film that transcend time and they transcend the generations.10 out of 10----What more can be said?

Without doubt the greatest family movie ever made. I remember like yesterday seeing this in the cinema aged 9, and nearly 40 years later it still makes me laugh, smile and cry.There are wonderful moments all the way throughout the movie and every child should see this movie at some point in their life. Yes the effects are not like the ones these days, but the story telling and warm feeling it gives you inside will give you something to cherish for ever.ET is magical in every sense of the word and will touch your heart like nothing else.

This might be the most perfect 80s movie out there. The score is on point as usual from John Williams and the kid actors are absolutely amazing. Spielberg is just a genius at just about everything he does. This movie just makes me smile every time I watch it.

Review:
'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is a science-fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg.
After a gentle alien becomes stranded on Earth, the being is discovered and befriended by a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas). Bringing the extraterrestrial into his suburban California house, Elliott introduces E.T., as the alien is dubbed, to his brother and his little sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore), and the children decide to keep its existence a secret. Soon, however, E.T. falls ill, resulting in government intervention and a dire situation for both Elliott and the alien.
E.T. is still consider one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's not hard to understand why. I just recently watched this again with my 7-yeard-old and we both had a very good time. This is a very good movie that the whole family can enjoy.
The overall acting was pretty good for it being a movie from the early 80's. I mean let's face it the stories were better and original back then, but the acting has come a long way. However, Spielberg pulled out a brilliant child performance from Henry Thomas. He did an amazing job as the main lead Elliot. You can watch his audition tape on YouTube and it's not hard to see why he got the job.
With Spielberg behind the camera, there was no way that people did not see that this was a success waiting to happen. The man does Science Fiction the way no other director can or at least has accomplished. He had three major success stories prior to E.T (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark) so having yet another brilliant success right afterwards basically cemented his name in Hollywood. The way he shoots this movie is breathtaking with a lot of wide angled takes.
Overall, this movie is just brilliant. I know there are some people that don't believe it aged well and think E.T is just creepy and don't really by into the story. But I do. I buy every single bit of it. I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves to sit down and watch a beautiful story about friendship, and how far some will go to help an individual in need.
5/5

Surprisingly overrated Steven Spielberg film about an alien from outer space who stumbles upon a typical Steven Spielberg 80s urban family: The kids know everything and the adults are the bad guys, because they know nothing and aren't in touch with their "feelings." This kids-are-smarter technique worked in a Spielberg-produced film called "The Goonies," but it doesn't work here. Tries to be cute but comes off sickening and sappy. Yuck. Followed by countless rip-offs including "Mac and Me."2.5/5 stars -John Ulmer

There are those times when all the forces at work come together and you have a masterpiece. This, of course, is a kids' movie. Obviously, it is so much more. It is a story of love and heart and character. To begin with, as a middle school teacher, I can attest to the wonderful casting and writing. It doesn't insult us. It shows us how a person who knows the heart of humanity (and that extends to the alien nation) can transcend cliché and put forth a beautiful story--but not a lightweight one by any means. The adults make up the periphery. The childlike quality of the lovable alien could only be appreciated and cared for by those who have not become as jaded as they. As soon as those adult figures show up, everyone is in trouble. Yet, for the most part, they have good intentions. The government agents are another issue. They bring force and death.Who hasn't seen this. There are series of episodes that have become part of our cultural landscape. Words have been brought into our language. We speak along with Elliot and ET. Halloween, phoning home, frogs all over the lab, hiding in the closet among the stuffed animals, the bike ride where the bikes suddenly leave the ground, the touching of the finger and the heart. It's just magical. Sometimes when one sees a movie, one begins to say, "If only they had done this or that." I can't think of anything in this film. Why write this review. Just to include my two cents' worth.

This is another blockbuster film of 25 years ago that is well-remembered but doesn't quite have the impact on multiple viewings and in years that have come-and-gone since 1982. Some movies still have a stunning impact, like Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyseey," or Spielberg's "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind," or even Scott's "Alien," but this sci-fi/alien movie seems to have lost its impact. Maybe it's just me, getting to be a cranky old man.It's still a cute show and one kids would like, except with the part where E.T. is close to death. This is another Steven Spielberg film in which the kids are smarter than the adults...and the adults are always the bad guys. He had that in a number of his popular films and I hope he is finally through with that tiresome nonsense. Maybe he actually learned that adults are smarter than six-year-olds (generally-speaking!).I got a kick out of this movie at the theater in 1982, but now it just looks too corny, manipulative and an insult to any adult's intelligence.

There's honestly nothing bad I can say about this movie. I loved ET when I was a little child and now at 39 I still love the movie!! Everytime I watch this MOVIE it makes me feel like a little kid again. It's very entertaining sweet and cool. Still there is one thing I have to mention. Steven Spielberg brought out a special DVD version of this movie. Which is called ET the special edition. It's still the same fabulous movie we all know. They just improved on 12% of the special effects and also included a never-before-seen fun and interesting scene where you learn ET can breathe underwater. It is an absolute must buy if you are a big fan of this movie. I will love this movie till the day I die. I always wished Spielberg had made a very emotional and cool sequel.

ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
Screw E.T.  Why is this movie praised so much?  It's pure garbage.  ET is an a**hole.  Why?  Because he was out in the forest lolly-gaggin' when his superiors were calling him back to his ship.  He was careless and missed the boat!  Simple as that.  And instead of being a man and paying the price for his own mistakes, he lays this guilt trip on all us humans and begs us to help him get back home.  Now it's our problem.  What a jerk!  Sorry, ET but I got my own problems.  What were you doing out there in the woods anyway? Probably devising some elaborate alien conspiracy that will baffle the minds of millions of society's greatest analysts for the next thousand generations.  I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.  Period.And once he gets here, look what he does.  He makes Elliot (the only one who loved him) sick.  So sick, in fact, he is near death.  If ET can touch a flower and bring it back to life, why doesn't he touch the boy who is doing his best to help him???  Elliot is really bustin' his ass for this punk alien.  He's telling his mother boldface lies, he is missing days at school, he becomes a part time wino, he gets a police rap sheet, quarantined from his neighborhood, then chased and shot at by the FBI.  All for this ingrate named ET, who never even gives so much as a thank you.  This is the thanks I get?  I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.I purchased the ET Scholastic book when I was in 2nd grade.  There, it stated that ET is 300 light years away from his home.  I don't think people realize how far that is.  A light year is the distance the speed of light travels during the course of 1 year.  The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.  Now there are 86,400 seconds in just one day, which means the distance of the speed of light is 148,800,000,000 miles in a day.  This number multiplied by the number of days in a year (365) brings us to 54,312,000,000,000.  This is the distance light travels (in miles) in just one year.  I repeat ONE year.  Now then, ET is 300 light years away from his home planet?  Fine.  There are 109,500 days in 300 years.  Which means the total mileage of how far ET's home from Earth is 10,346,436,000,000,000,000. I know these are all just mind numbing figures to you, so to put it in greater perspective, ET had to begin his journey to Earth about 10 trillion years before the first dinosaur was created in order to get here by 1982, the year of the movie's release.  And Elliot made contact with his home with a friggin' Speak-N-Spell.This movie is so stupid.  How ET even has the balls to ask his homies to COME BACK and get him a second time is beyond me.  The speed of sound is even slower than light, so Elliot should have been about 20 trillion years old before the aliens even GOT the signal.  Then another approximate 47 trillion years later (not counting rest stops and space tolls) before they actually arrive to get ET.  Elliot would be an old man by the time they got back.As for the movie itself, it introduces some of the dumbest characters I have ever seen in a movie.  During Halloween, the kids throw a sheet over ET and Dee Wallace doesn't even notice her own child is a foot shorter and her head's 10 pounds heavier.  Then when they go trick or treating, ET mistakes a kid dressed as Yoda as one of his hometown natives.  How stupid is this alien?  He's smart enough to learn English in 2 hours but can't tell a kid in a costume.  Yoda's from Dagobah, for Christ's sake!  He looks nothing like ET.  Even I can tell the difference and I've never even been to Dagobah.  ET must be the Rain Man of his planet.  The more I watch the movie, the more I realize how autistic ET is.  He even enjoyed it when Drew Barrymore had her way with him and turned him into a cross dresser.I really like the end sequence when all the kids put masks over their faces during the big FBI chase.  Is Spielberg that stingy with his money that he couldn't afford stunt look alikes?  So instead he'll save a buck by hiding their faces so we can't see them, but never mind the fact that each kid grows 2 feet taller and 20 pounds heavier.  And after they all fly, how corny was their landing?  Perfect formation, BMX style!  Hahaha!  It looked like a deleted scene from that movie Rad.So, yes, ET is a bad movie.  Crap special effects, crap acting, crap story. It wasn't even half as good as Mac and Me.  ET is not fun for the entire family, as most believe it to be.  Fun for the whole family is a movie like Animal House.  Kids like d*ck and fart jokes, trust me.  Not some kid hugging a nightmare inducing creature with his heart pumpin' on the outside. How scary was that?  I tell, you, one day the sequel will come out and you will all see I was right.  ET is evil.  Just like every other alien in every other movie.  After Close Encounters, Independence Day, and V.....I DO NOT TRUST ALIENS.Zero stars out of 5.

This movie really disgusted me. But let me explain....It is not that I don't believe in sentimentality. I am a HUGE Frank Capra fan. And I can't watch "Field of Dreams" (which I know isn't Capra) without tears in my eyes at many points in the movie. So that isn't it. It's just that "E.T." is so phony, so synthetic, so made-up, so ENGINEERED to try to make me feel something, that I have to resent it. I'll just never understand Spielberg. For so long, I had nothing but contempt for him. Till Schindler's List. (Does anyone (other than Nazis) not like Schindler's List?) And then, too, he made Saturday-morning worth getting up for. (Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain). I finally (and grudgingly) had to admit that the man is a genius. But he is a genius who has done some bad work. And E.T. was some of his worst work.
