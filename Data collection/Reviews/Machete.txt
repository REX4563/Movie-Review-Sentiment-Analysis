This film is what it says it is. Nothing less. And perhaps a little more. Most of Machete's critics that have given overall negative reviews, have fallen into a trap of their own devices. Machete is an exploitation film and was advertised as such. By definition, and exploitation film will include excessive violence, gore, nudity, and be high on intentional corny lines while low on plot devices and character development. To give low ratings to Machete because of one's distaste for the genre, would be like saying "The Shinning was awful because I don't like horror." This is one of Rodriguez best films to date, side by side with Sin City (2005). Machete delivers on all accounts of action, gore, nudity, and corny lines. The plot is simple, but honestly, that's how it should be. The thing that sets this apart from other exploitation films is that the acting is top notch. I personally found that the three main female characters to be the most intriguing and diverse.Jessica Alba plays the part of an ICE agent struggling with her loyalty to her nation and her people. She slowly begins to question her own logic on if people should follow law simply because they are laws. We see this struggle immediately, when she approaches a taco stand (apparently once every week) to by a coffee and lunch, despite her own people feeling from her site. Why does she continue this ritual? She says it is to check the papers of the character Luz, but really it is to try and hold onto a sliver of identity among her people. Michelle Rodriguez plays said Luz (aka She) as an underground leader of illegal immigration. The character of Luz is a simple woman who believes in not bending to the broken system, but fighting for her people (the mirror image of Alba). "She" is only a myth on which Luz has built a cult following, understanding that sometimes being a myth can do more damage than flesh and blood. By the end of the film, Luz is reborn as the mythical She, just in time for the bloody battle.Finally, the actress that surprised me the most was Lindsay Lohan. Despite only receiving 10-15 minutes of screen time (most are which she is undressed), she plays her character perfectly and flawlessly. The role seems to be written specifically for her and I applaud her for stepping up and taking on such a mature role. One of her first scenes is a tongue-in-cheek conversation about how she needs to give the people of the internet what they want, and that is more of her. Lohan played the part beautifully (in all aspects) and specks of talent are clearly visible. I hope that filmmakers and audiences (as well as herself) continue to allow her opportunities to showcase that talent. Machete is an exploitation film at its finest. And, for the most part, if you are the type of cinema attendee who wants to see a movie called Machete in the first place, chances are you will be thoroughly entertained.

Padre Benito del Toro: It's not safe for you to be here. Machete: I'm not looking for "safe." Padre Benito del Toro: No, I mean it's not safe for me for you to be here!When you can sit back and relax with a Grindhouse satire like Machete, then you are a cinema devotee who accepts outrageous violence and a bit of skin in a Mexploitation fun house. Robert Rodriguez (whose El Mariachi started his career) is the co-writer/co-director (with Ethan Maniquis) of arguably his best production since Sin City—Machete. Or maybe his and Quentin Tarantino's cult fav, Grindhouse (2007). At any rate, Rodriguez has become synonymous with outright bloody business reminiscent of cheap B movies in the '70's, and he's the best at it.Machete, played by Danny Trejo, is as ugly as you could hope for in an unstoppable warrior with restless knives. He is a Mexican federale seeking revenge for his family slaughtered by drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal with a bad toupee). Although the hearty laughs don't last the whole film (after all, too many severed limbs are not sustainable comedy), Rodriguez has other moments to keep us interested, such as a bare-breasted Lindsey Lohan in a pool scene and in another with a machine gun in nun's garb.All of this fun is in the service of a message, albeit too obvious for my tastes as it slows the latter part of the film with stagey speeches about the crimes against illegal immigrants. The bad guys promote a tougher border presence to deter the aliens, not because they are doing anything immoral, but because tighter borders mean higher prices.Machete puts an amusing end to a tepid cinema summer (with the exception of the challenging Inception)—after all, if Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, and Don Johnson can have fun in this mayhem, so can we.

The big hour of Danny Trejo (Machete) has finally arrived. Yes, this is the first movie where the ex-convict and a man who's face looks like a Moon's landscape, is in a leading role. He does well in his role. This is exactly what he is good at. And it is killing (bad) people. He is doing that extremely stylish I gotta tell you. Just look at the first scene.Robert Rodriguez has his own earmark. This is something you know what to expect, but you still looking forward to see, cause you wanna see how is he doing that this time. It's called riot. A crazy rumble which is out of control. It happens here too. And it's solid and quite fun.This is a good entertainment. It's not for everybody. Rodriguez fans love it, others just feel a bit entertained.

MACHETE, a Robert Rodriguez film, starring Danny Trejo, Jessica Alba,  Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Robert DeNiro, Steven Seagal, Lindsay  Lohan, Tom Savini, Cheech Marin, and Don Johnson. Soak that in for a  moment.  The story for Machete, as outlandish as it is, goes something like  this: He looked like just another day laborer from the hood, and the  perfect scapegoat for a corrupt political assassination. But he turned  out to be MACHETE, a legendary ex-Federale with a deadly attitude and  the skills to match. Left for dead after attempting to go against the  notorious Mexican drug kingpin Torrez, Steven Seagal, Machete has  escaped to Texas. But what he finds is a web of corruption and betrayal  that leaves a bullet in a senator, Robert DeNiro, and Machete a wanted  man. Machete sets out to clear his name and expose this conspiracy, but  he does it. The MACHETE way. What ensues is a wildly creative tale of  carnage, vengeance, and a Mexican Revolution. You might have been  familiar with this film since 2007, since a fake trailer for Machete  was shown in the ambitious double feature event Grindhouse that is now  regarded as legendary trailer. Well, now you have your entire film  version.  Danny Trejo is finally getting his due here. Always the most bad-ass in  his film appearances, he's never had much of a leading role, except for  now. He is fantastic as Machete, and at the current age of 66, the  action he does is pretty phenomenal. Machete is the type of character  that always gets the one-up on the bad guys and the love of the ladies,  and you can just sense that Trejo is loving every moment of it.  Luckily, so are we.  Machete is a film chock-full of truly schmaltzy performances from every  member of the cast. The big difference here is that the schmaltz is  intentional. The villains of this movie are so appropriately evil and  murderous, with a samurai sword wielding Steven Seagal, in his first  villainous role, simply stealing the show as Torrez. Yes, I just said  that Steven Seagal stole the show over a hilarious politically  incorrect politician Robert DeNiro, a sleazy rogue businessman Jeff  Fahey, and a sinister Mexican shooting Don Johnson. You really want to  see these foes get what they deserve. Bonus points if you spot Quentin  Tarantino in a blink and you miss it cameo! With these villains, and  their humorous henchmen, Machete also has his own connections and  compadres. Jessica Alba is, believe it or not, the main love interest  to Machete and some of her deliveries are so cringe-inducing, it's  squirm-worthy. Yet, she's alright! There's also Michelle Rodriguez as  Luz, a rather attractive taco truck lady who may have a secret identity  as a Mexican patriot who plays it just fine. But it's Padre, Machete's  brother, played by Cheech Marin, whose sequences in the film are some  of the very best. He's hysterical and can handle dual shotguns like  nobody else. And yes, Lindsay Lohan is in this and she's not half-bad  for the little things she has to do. When she's not nude, she's dressed  up as a pretty nifty revolver packing nun, but she doesn't pack that  much of a punch.  Machete is a film that embodies all of the facets a 1970s  blaxploitation film would have, but with the Hispanic culture. This is  Mexploitation, with a resonant grindhouse feeling, complete with film  reel scratches and fake political ads. But the violence and action in  this is so extraordinary and unapologetically gruesome, with the  extremity of it all not being taken seriously at all. The things they  do in this film, guaranteed you haven't seen most of them ever done  before. Corkscrews, high-heels, weed-whackers, and, of course,  machetes, are only a very small listing of all the tools and weapons  used to dispatch characters in Machete. It's over the top, absolutely  ridiculous scenes that pop up every five minutes and make for a joyous  film experience. There are too many be-headings, blood-splattering  gunshots, and limb removals to count. Don't even get me started on the  stabbings. To add the cherry on top, Machete is shot perfectly,  fluidly, and inventively.  Machete is completely, for lack of a better term, over the top, has a  fitting heavy and groovy soundtrack, and never holds back on the gore.  The dialogue is hokey and full of Mexican puns, but it knows this.  Machete loves to poke fun at itself and its ridiculous concepts, with  characters questioning certain events in the movie, realizations that  everything is insane, and an awesome B-movie touch that graces the  opening of the end credits. Machete is Robert Rodriguez's most  enjoyable and best film to date. It's so fun, so amazing, and actually  provides a sort of a social political message, now with racial  profiling and immigration being a controversial Americana topic. It's  why Machete is such a great film for the times, and will be looked upon  as one of the culturally relevant films of the last couple years I'm  as shocked as you are.  Machete is the best action film of 2010 and is certainly one of the  best of the year. It's fantastic entertainment that I oh so highly  recommend you watch. Machete es...... Yes, excelente.

I' try to keep it short and to the point. The action scenes were boring and the only thing that made this movie watchable was the star cast and some one-liner jokes. Don't get me wrong, I thought there were some good scenes in this movie but not enough to make a full length motion picture worthwhile. I suggest you (re)watch Grindhouse and Desperado instead of this mess of poor gore action and politics.PS! Why does Machete have 6 throwing knives and a bunch of machetes under his coat when he only uses the one in his hand?! Also Segal has gained enough weight to not be suitable for any action apparently so all scenes that required any movement at all were filmed with a double from behind and the 1 minute end fight was really boring. So my question is why give him any martial arts scenes to begin with?

I caught a screening of this film not too long ago, and all I have to say is that it was an adrenaline rush! The violence was overwhelming, and the writing was cornily witty. Pretty good performances all around from Alba, Trejo, DeNiro, Seagal, Lohan and many a more. Great entertainment, perfect to sit down with some buddies on a Saturday night and have a good laugh.No doubt in my mind this will do well in the box office, and well, not so well with the critics. But forget what the critics say this is a great flick, and a damn fun one too!Plot: After being betrayed by the organization who hired him, an ex-Federale launches a brutal rampage of revenge against his former boss.usualfilmfan

I'd hadn't heard much about this film, I hadn't seen the trailer or even the fake trailer attached to Grindhouse. I ended up randomly seeing this film anyway, and wow! The film is very OTT, it's extremely gruesome, crude, and a lot of fun. It is definitely not everybody's cup of tea, probably too absurd for a lot, but I liked it. It dragged in parts, but it was still very entertaining in a fun way. Just don't expect anything serious or believable. Basically, in case you don't know the story, Danny Trejo plays Machete, an ex ferale whos wife is brutally murdered, and who subsequently goes on an epic rampage to get revenge. There's nothing new here in the story, which is brief and to the point. Don't expect something intelligent, leave your brain at the door for this one. All in all it is good old fashioned mindless fun, but as I said it did start to get tiresome after a while (how long can you sit and watch a 60 year old man running around Amierca killing people with a machete?) It is still worth a watch, definitely if your into action packed splatter fests and B movies.

I have a question for a lot of the positive reviewers on here: Did you REALLY like this movie, or are you just gushing out of respect for Rodriguez??? I'm a Rodriguez fan too, in case you didn't know. Tarantino and Rodriguez are the kings of b-movies. They know how to make a good b-movie and their extensive filmography has shown. With Tarantino you have Kill Bill, Jackie Brown and Inglourious Basterds, with Rodiriguez you have Planet Terror, From Dusk Till Dawn and the king of all things "Visually gorgeous", Sin City. What I love about both of them is that while their films are indeed exercises in Style Over Substance, they're aware of it and don't take themselves too seriously.I still stand by Grindhouse as the most fun I've had at the theatre. Two great movies from two fantastic directors with some hilarious fake trailers thrown in there for the price of one. After "Hobo With A Shotgun", "Machete" showed. I laughed so hard! And then the news broke that Machete was going to be a full movie. I was excited.Turns out, some fake trailers should just stay fake trailers.As I mentioned earlier, Rodriguez's films are Style Over Substance. But they are aware of it, and don't take themselves too seriously, and for that, come off as awesome. Was this movie Style Over Substance? Yes. Did it follow its "Don't take yourself too seriously" rule? Well, it did... for the first 20 minutes.I was liking the first 20 minutes. Even as a gore hound, I was wondering if I should be eating during that scene! Then of course, we get the awesome betrayal scene and the hospital scene... I especially loved when Machete cut the man's abdomen open and used his intestine as a rope to escape through a window. I laughed!!! Then it went downhill from there.First off, Jessica Alba was annoying. Take her out of the movie and it wouldn't be different. All she does is just run around and scream the plot out loud. The most cringe worthy scene was near the end when she got up on the bonnet of the car and made that speech. That brought back memories of "Robin Hood" of earlier this year (you know what scene I'm talking about). Second, this film has too much plot in it, and too many characters. For a movie that's supposed to be a b-flick, this movie shouldn't be about political mumbo jumbo.The characters are a big letdown here. Or at least the representation of characters. Let's begin. "She" is a great character. About halfway through the film she is killed off... then near the end she survived!!! Or the Priest. He is a likable character too. Then he gets killed off 5 minutes after his first appearance. Or what about Daryl Sabara's character? He's a funny guy and he has (what feels like) 30 seconds of screen time... and yet he's one of the main actors in the opening credits!!! Bigger yet, what about the villain? WHO'S THE VILLAIN? Is it Segal, who has a total of 6 minutes of screen time, De Niro, or Fahey, who easily out of the three supposed villains gets the most screen time... except he dies 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLIMAX. Or Lindsay Lohan... why is she even in there, other than the fact that she's Fahey's character's daughter??? The climax is a total anticlimax. There's no excitement in the battle at all, it's incredibly dull and boring. Even the iconic bit shown in the trailer with the bike was underwhelming. And Segal's character's death even felt copped out and lazy.By the time the film was done, I was so glad I was out of the theatre. The film bored me enough with its slow pace. For a movie that claims to be an ultra gory action b-flick, there's about 10 minutes of action, 90 minutes of boring dialogue. This is supposed to be a b-movie, not some political crap. I like slow paced films, but not when they're supposed to be fun b-movies.Sorry, Mr. Rodriguez, but I think your days are numbered!

Of all the movies i have EVER seen in a theater.....i can say with no doubts in my mind, that the most fun i have ever had, was with 2007's "Grindhouse". It is cinematic fun at it's purest. It reminded me why it is still fun to go to the movies. So when i heard that they were making one of the fake previews into an actual full length feature, i became just as excited as i did 3 years ago.Okay, just so i am clear with everyone......i am aware, and i appreciate the difference between "Dumb/Funny" and "Dumb/Dumb". And by that i mean it's funny when a movie is being dumb on purpose. I love it, and i laugh hysterically. A good example of this would be "Planet Terror" or "Evil Dead". But sometimes, the movie can get a little ahead of itself and not focus on making the story fun as well, which is a key element if you want your movie to be considered a fun "B" movie. "Machete" fell into the category of Dumb/Dumb.....which to me is a major disappointment.Dare i say that the movie lost focus of actually being a "Grindhouse" movie? You bet i do. It was clear that Robert Rodriguez was aiming this story towards the recent events that are taking place in Arizona. By making stupid inspirational lines of dialogue that were not entertaining, but boring as all hell. Needless to say, it felt like a movie that was trying to make a political statement, as opposed to a cheesy drive-in action flick. Don't get me wrong, the movie had a few elements that would pop out and make you laugh, just like you were hoping for........but they were not at every turn. In fact, you were almost begging for them. And it was due to this........first off, i love Danny Trejo, and i think him as a main character is awesome......but he came off as so dull and lifeless, it was almost hard to root for him. Secondly, the action was fun, but it came in very small doses. Which is really surprising to me, because Rodriguez is normally a huge fan of blowing up everything.....and i thought he was going to go over the top with this one because, well, it's suppose to be a 70's type action flick. Instead, it just came off as dull and half witted.Bottom Line......i gotta be honest, I'm a little upset with this one. I had really high expectations, and this movie fell way short of them. In my opinion, Rodriguez can't make sequels. To sum it up......he did the same thing to "Grindhouse", that he did to "Desperado". So if you actually liked the movie "Once Upon a Time in Mexico", then maybe you'll like this. But i gotta tell ya, it certainly isn't the Grindhouse spin-off i was hoping for.

I'm not going to lie, the first thing that struck me was the glaring political messages in this movie. They are ridiculously one-dimensional and reappear throughout the movie; they serve no purpose but to support the loosening of illegal immigration enforcement on the Mexico-US border.Everything else basically followed your generic American action movie: killings, sex, a simple plot that is not too difficult for the audience, etc. After watching 30 minutes of the movie, I was already sick of it. It may be "brainless fun," but, although it is definitely brainless, it managed to not entertain me even when employing stars like Deniro to its obvious cause. Trashy movie that is not worthy of an 8/10.

In Mexico, the determinate federal agent Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) opposes to the order of his chief and drives with his partner to the hideout of the drug lord Rogelio Torrez (Steven Seagal) to rescue an abducted woman (Mayra Leal) that is witness against the gangster. However, he finds the witness naked on the bed but he is surprisingly betrayed by her, and his wife and daughter are murdered by Torrez. Three years later, Machete is an illegal immigrant in Texas that wanders on the streets seeking job in the Day Labor Site. He is hired by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to assassinate the boasting right-winged Senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), who is against the immigrants and defends the construction of an electrified fence along the border with Mexico. Machete receives one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the assignment, but he gives the money to Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), a Mexican woman that sells taco in her truck and manages the underground Network that assists illegal Mexicans and helped Machete three years ago.When Machete is ready as a sniper in a tower, he finds that he has been betrayed and set up by Booth, who actually is McLaughlin's adviser and plotted the scheme to improve the statistics with the sympathy of the electors to McLaughlin. Once again Machete survives and discovers that Booth supports the vigilantes led by the cruel Von Jackson (Don Johnson) and is associated to Torrez. Now Machete seeks revenge against his enemies and becomes a myth."Machete" is a funny action movie and THE FILM of Danny Trejo that perfectly fits to the anti-hero. The story follows the style of B- movies, with exploitation and ultra-violence, but has a cast that is a constellation of stars. There are memorable lines (my favorite is when the priest says "God has mercy, I don't") and details, like the name of the garage (Machete's Chop Shop). I have just watched this film on DVD, and the deleted scenes shows many details of the story that unfortunately have been deleted in the edition, like the twin sister of Sartana Rivera "Sis", or Rose McGowan as the assassin "Boots McCoy". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Machete"Note: On 22 September 2015, I saw this film again.

Machete is one of those films that you know what to expect before you go in. It is understood that this is an exploitation flick, which will have excessive violence, sex and nudity. What pleased me most about this film, that as well as that (which should be minimal expectation before going in), it has a well told cohesive story and some real power house acting. I am a big fan of Rodriguez's earlier film, 'Desperado,' and Machete is similar to that; except where Desperado took itself seriously, this film has its tongue firmly in cheek and from this you get a lot of the humour - and it works. From start, all the way through to the finish, there is something happening that keeps you glued to the screen. Perfect to watch in a group, especially if some of them have a low attention span. Limits have been pushed and I love it. It is not excessive violence for random excessive violence sake; it's been thought about and works extremely well in regard to the story and tone of the film. I would describe 'Planet Terror' as a practice for what Rodriguez wanted that didn't quite deliver and Machete as the masterpiece - that delivers on all cylinders. I cannot recommend this film enough as a riotous laugh out loud, violent and engaging experience.

Machete is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast that all play characters none of them have really played anything similar to before.The movie is an action movie that knows exactly what genre it is,it dosen't try to develop its characters too much or make you really care about them,it's just fun and action packed,and dosen't try to be any more than that.The cast is outstanding,Danny Trejo is perfectly suited as the title character,and I also really liked Jessica Alba,Robert De Niro,Steven Seagal,Lindsay Lohan and Cheech Marin,they were all clearly in on the joke and seemed to have had a lot of fun being in this movie.Simply a fun movie that is very quick and enjoyable,I would recommend Machete to anyone looking for a good action movie. A former lawman gets caught up in an assassination plot.Best Performance: Danny Trejo Worst Performance: Ara Celi

There are a number of great Mexploitation films. "El Mariachi," "Desperado" and "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" all come to mind. Not only were those films action-packed and entertaining, but they contained good plots which one could follow without losing interest.Then, there's "Machete." I'll keep things honest, seeing as (apparently) the only submitted reviews were done by film crew members.The movie starts out well. In the first scene, Machete (and his partner, who dies almost immediately) storms into a drug cartel, wreaking havoc against armed goons with nothing but his (get ready) machete. He kills about a dozen people, rescuing a naked female hostage in the process. However, as they're leaving the cartel hideout, she betrays Machete to the cartel's leader, a man named Torrez (played by Steven Seagal). Machete being subdued, Torrez tortures Machete but decides not to kill him. Instead, he kills Machete's wife and child and leaves Machete alive so that he can suffer for the rest of his life.Yes, it's simple, but the movie actually looked quite good up until this point. Then, the nightmare began.Rather than construct a decent story and continue with the main plot (i.e., a man with nothing to lose trying to avenge the deaths of his wife and child), the movie veers off into a tirade of politicizations and hate-mongering. It portrays white conservatives (get ready for some originality) as racist red-necks who are hell-bent on killing Mexicans for sheer enjoyment. It even shows a U.S. Senator (played by Robert De Niro) killing a pregnant illegal alien and her spouse, saying afterward, "My supporters would love this" (paraphrase).(Yes, Hollywood, people are not against illegal immigration because it destroys the Rule of Law, hurts the economy, increases unemployment, increases violent crime, puts financial burdens on tax-payers, etc. - it's because they hate Hispanics).Before continuing, I just want to mention that the writer of this review is the product of a Hispanic father. OK, here we go.As already mentioned, after the opening sequence, the movie becomes overtly political. The aforementioned senator (played by De Niro) is seen campaigning for re-election, his main political platform being the construction of a border-fence designed to keep out illegal aliens (the horror!). However, many people in power are against this, and they hire Machete (now a day-laborer) to assassinate the senator. Of course, as indicated by the coming attractions, Machete is betrayed by the very people who hire him, and it is revealed that they are, in fact, working for the very cartel leader who killed Machete's family (what a startling coincidence!). It turns out that Machete was only hired to arouse public sympathy for the senator and increase the public's demand for a border fence (which Torrez, the cartel leader who killed Machete's family, wants, given that then he can control the drug trade between the Mexican-U.S. border).The story gets very boring, with immigration politics ascending into the forefront. The action slows down to a grinding halt, and the story devolves into simple political platitudes (check out Jessica Alba's call for a race-war near the end of the movie, demanding that illegal immigrants incite violence in order to acquire citizenship).In conclusion, this movie sucks. Mr. Rodriguez, I want my money back.

First time encounter with Machete was from those Grindhouse commercials. So when the movie came out I expected a joyous experience.Machete delivers almost every scene and it's a high paced action-comedy. If you're watching it today, the resemblance to the current presidency of Donald Trump shines out through the whole movie.Easy to watch and maybe an ice-breaker with friends on weekends. (People with over analytical personalities might not enjoy it as much as you or me.)

Machete is one of the funnest movies I've ever seen. Right from the beginning you know this movie doesn't take itself seriously. It's essentially a live-action cartoon with A-list actors. You have Danny Trejo - the antithesis of a leading man - carrying the movie as Machete, the unkillable badass Mexican James Bond. If you want to talk plot, this is basically a revenge story. Steven Seagal kills his family, then years later Machete gets caught up in a political scandal where Robert De Niro is playing a cross between George Bush and Donald Trump, and somehow Seagal's character is pulling the strings. It's as amazing as it sounds. Then you have Don Johnson as the head of border patrol or something, mowing down Mexicans all over the place, and Jeff Fahey as one of Seagal's enforcers in Texas. Now you may be thinking, "Four villains? This sounds more convoluted than Spiderman 3!" And you'd have a point if this was a traditional action movie, but it's not. At all. It's a comedy more than anything with some ridiculous action sequences and gratuitous T&A all over the place. These characters just serve to forward the plot, and to give us some belly laughs, and somehow it all works beautifully.Jessica Alba is one of the officers assigned to this scandal. Michelle Rodriguez serves as the leader of a Mexican resistance, oh and there's Lindsey Lohan playing Jeff Fahey's "religious" daughter. There are so many characters and somehow they all fit the movie perfectly. All of the acting is great (well, Alba is never "great" but she serves her purpose and she's as hot as a supernova so who cares). But you can buy Robert De Niro as a corrupt senator, Don Johnson as this racist megalomaniac, Fahey as this hard-ass enforcer, and Seagal as a Mexican drug lord. Yeah. And the best part is they're all having a blast. It's pure mayhem going on, and you're not bored for a second. Danny Trejo as the title character deserves much props though. He just looks like a guy who would have a wide array of knives stashed under his vest, and the guy is making out with some of the hottest women on the planet. It's the role of a lifetime.Robert Rodriguez is amazing for making this an actual movie, and the cast are amazing for agreeing to be part of this project. It's so, so, SO entertaining. It's damn near impossible to sit through this movie with a straight face. I had a big fat grin throughout the whole thing. If you like silly action movies with fantastic actors and a surprisingly good plot, then look no further than Machete.

When I saw the trailer for this film I thought it had to be trash but I laughed almost from the beginning to the end. Tongue in cheek humour - it's all intentional, there is nothing unfunny about Machete.I was ready for a lot of gore but it was all done in such a hilarious way that I hardly noticed how disgusting it was. I fact, I was still laughing 5 minutes after I left the cinema.If he wasn't already so old I would say Danny Trejo was an undiscovered talent set for a meteoric rise, but the guy is already 64. I never could have guessed as the adrenaline and action pumped incessantly.... and hysterically this weather-beaten old dude also managed effortlessly to bed any chiquita he came across, and in style too.Machete kills and maims and has sex all the way through the movie, but amazingly he is also a gentleman. you have to love him.The best movie I have seen this year and the best movie of this genre for some time. Top marks for not taking itself one bit seriously but knowing exactly how to entertain!

This film is what it says it is. Nothing less. And perhaps a little more. Most of Machete's critics that have given overall negative reviews, have fallen into a trap of their own devices. Machete is an exploitation film and was advertised as such. By definition, and exploitation film will include excessive violence, gore, nudity, and be high on intentional corny lines while low on plot devices and character development. To give low ratings to Machete because of one's distaste for the genre, would be like saying "The Shinning was awful because I don't like horror." This is one of Rodriguez best films to date, side by side with Sin City (2005). Machete delivers on all accounts of action, gore, nudity, and corny lines. The plot is simple, but honestly, that's how it should be. The thing that sets this apart from other exploitation films is that the acting is top notch. I personally found that the three main female characters to be the most intriguing and diverse.Jessica Alba plays the part of an ICE agent struggling with her loyalty to her nation and her people. She slowly begins to question her own logic on if people should follow law simply because they are laws. We see this struggle immediately, when she approaches a taco stand (apparently once every week) to by a coffee and lunch, despite her own people feeling from her site. Why does she continue this ritual? She says it is to check the papers of the character Luz, but really it is to try and hold onto a sliver of identity among her people. Michelle Rodriguez plays said Luz (aka She) as an underground leader of illegal immigration. The character of Luz is a simple woman who believes in not bending to the broken system, but fighting for her people (the mirror image of Alba). "She" is only a myth on which Luz has built a cult following, understanding that sometimes being a myth can do more damage than flesh and blood. By the end of the film, Luz is reborn as the mythical She, just in time for the bloody battle.Finally, the actress that surprised me the most was Lindsay Lohan. Despite only receiving 10-15 minutes of screen time (most are which she is undressed), she plays her character perfectly and flawlessly. The role seems to be written specifically for her and I applaud her for stepping up and taking on such a mature role. One of her first scenes is a tongue-in-cheek conversation about how she needs to give the people of the internet what they want, and that is more of her. Lohan played the part beautifully (in all aspects) and specks of talent are clearly visible. I hope that filmmakers and audiences (as well as herself) continue to allow her opportunities to showcase that talent. Machete is an exploitation film at its finest. And, for the most part, if you are the type of cinema attendee who wants to see a movie called Machete in the first place, chances are you will be thoroughly entertained.

Padre Benito del Toro: It's not safe for you to be here. Machete: I'm not looking for "safe." Padre Benito del Toro: No, I mean it's not safe for me for you to be here!When you can sit back and relax with a Grindhouse satire like Machete, then you are a cinema devotee who accepts outrageous violence and a bit of skin in a Mexploitation fun house. Robert Rodriguez (whose El Mariachi started his career) is the co-writer/co-director (with Ethan Maniquis) of arguably his best production since Sin City—Machete. Or maybe his and Quentin Tarantino's cult fav, Grindhouse (2007). At any rate, Rodriguez has become synonymous with outright bloody business reminiscent of cheap B movies in the '70's, and he's the best at it.Machete, played by Danny Trejo, is as ugly as you could hope for in an unstoppable warrior with restless knives. He is a Mexican federale seeking revenge for his family slaughtered by drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal with a bad toupee). Although the hearty laughs don't last the whole film (after all, too many severed limbs are not sustainable comedy), Rodriguez has other moments to keep us interested, such as a bare-breasted Lindsey Lohan in a pool scene and in another with a machine gun in nun's garb.All of this fun is in the service of a message, albeit too obvious for my tastes as it slows the latter part of the film with stagey speeches about the crimes against illegal immigrants. The bad guys promote a tougher border presence to deter the aliens, not because they are doing anything immoral, but because tighter borders mean higher prices.Machete puts an amusing end to a tepid cinema summer (with the exception of the challenging Inception)—after all, if Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, and Don Johnson can have fun in this mayhem, so can we.

The big hour of Danny Trejo (Machete) has finally arrived. Yes, this is the first movie where the ex-convict and a man who's face looks like a Moon's landscape, is in a leading role. He does well in his role. This is exactly what he is good at. And it is killing (bad) people. He is doing that extremely stylish I gotta tell you. Just look at the first scene.Robert Rodriguez has his own earmark. This is something you know what to expect, but you still looking forward to see, cause you wanna see how is he doing that this time. It's called riot. A crazy rumble which is out of control. It happens here too. And it's solid and quite fun.This is a good entertainment. It's not for everybody. Rodriguez fans love it, others just feel a bit entertained.

Machete is Robert Rodriguez's film based on his mock trailer made for the double grindhouse release of Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof and his own Planet Terror. B-Grade superstar Danny Trejo stars as the title character. Those that have seen the mock trailer, or the grindhouse films, know the style of yester-year that Machete is representing. Cheap, nasty, and funny is the order of the day for this kind of film. Rodriguez clearly knows his genre and audience. He goes all out with this over-the-top action flick. The story is, of course, ridiculous. Machete is betrayed by some "above the law" dudes and has to get revenge by slicing and dicing whoever gets in his way. The film does what it says on the cover. Don't go in expecting a glimmer of subtlety or characterization. Go in expecting action, titties, action, blood, titties, oh and action. This would be all well and good except for some slight problems. The unashamedly preachy messages against the Mexican/United States border does get a bit tiring, as does the repetitive nature of the violence (after some interesting action set- pieces they all become similar, except towards the end). Also, this kind of film needs to be much snappier and shorter. It's around twenty minutes too long so that the humor and overall style tends to drag on a bit. Machete holds it's tongue permanently in cheek and Danny Trejo milks every scene as much as he possibly can. Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez and Lindsay Lohan all make for good eye candy and there are some very funny moments. All in all, this exercise in grindhouse excess should keep the fans of this style very happy, even if it can slightly bore others.

MACHETE, a Robert Rodriguez film, starring Danny Trejo, Jessica Alba,  Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Robert DeNiro, Steven Seagal, Lindsay  Lohan, Tom Savini, Cheech Marin, and Don Johnson. Soak that in for a  moment.  The story for Machete, as outlandish as it is, goes something like  this: He looked like just another day laborer from the hood, and the  perfect scapegoat for a corrupt political assassination. But he turned  out to be MACHETE, a legendary ex-Federale with a deadly attitude and  the skills to match. Left for dead after attempting to go against the  notorious Mexican drug kingpin Torrez, Steven Seagal, Machete has  escaped to Texas. But what he finds is a web of corruption and betrayal  that leaves a bullet in a senator, Robert DeNiro, and Machete a wanted  man. Machete sets out to clear his name and expose this conspiracy, but  he does it. The MACHETE way. What ensues is a wildly creative tale of  carnage, vengeance, and a Mexican Revolution. You might have been  familiar with this film since 2007, since a fake trailer for Machete  was shown in the ambitious double feature event Grindhouse that is now  regarded as legendary trailer. Well, now you have your entire film  version.  Danny Trejo is finally getting his due here. Always the most bad-ass in  his film appearances, he's never had much of a leading role, except for  now. He is fantastic as Machete, and at the current age of 66, the  action he does is pretty phenomenal. Machete is the type of character  that always gets the one-up on the bad guys and the love of the ladies,  and you can just sense that Trejo is loving every moment of it.  Luckily, so are we.  Machete is a film chock-full of truly schmaltzy performances from every  member of the cast. The big difference here is that the schmaltz is  intentional. The villains of this movie are so appropriately evil and  murderous, with a samurai sword wielding Steven Seagal, in his first  villainous role, simply stealing the show as Torrez. Yes, I just said  that Steven Seagal stole the show over a hilarious politically  incorrect politician Robert DeNiro, a sleazy rogue businessman Jeff  Fahey, and a sinister Mexican shooting Don Johnson. You really want to  see these foes get what they deserve. Bonus points if you spot Quentin  Tarantino in a blink and you miss it cameo! With these villains, and  their humorous henchmen, Machete also has his own connections and  compadres. Jessica Alba is, believe it or not, the main love interest  to Machete and some of her deliveries are so cringe-inducing, it's  squirm-worthy. Yet, she's alright! There's also Michelle Rodriguez as  Luz, a rather attractive taco truck lady who may have a secret identity  as a Mexican patriot who plays it just fine. But it's Padre, Machete's  brother, played by Cheech Marin, whose sequences in the film are some  of the very best. He's hysterical and can handle dual shotguns like  nobody else. And yes, Lindsay Lohan is in this and she's not half-bad  for the little things she has to do. When she's not nude, she's dressed  up as a pretty nifty revolver packing nun, but she doesn't pack that  much of a punch.  Machete is a film that embodies all of the facets a 1970s  blaxploitation film would have, but with the Hispanic culture. This is  Mexploitation, with a resonant grindhouse feeling, complete with film  reel scratches and fake political ads. But the violence and action in  this is so extraordinary and unapologetically gruesome, with the  extremity of it all not being taken seriously at all. The things they  do in this film, guaranteed you haven't seen most of them ever done  before. Corkscrews, high-heels, weed-whackers, and, of course,  machetes, are only a very small listing of all the tools and weapons  used to dispatch characters in Machete. It's over the top, absolutely  ridiculous scenes that pop up every five minutes and make for a joyous  film experience. There are too many be-headings, blood-splattering  gunshots, and limb removals to count. Don't even get me started on the  stabbings. To add the cherry on top, Machete is shot perfectly,  fluidly, and inventively.  Machete is completely, for lack of a better term, over the top, has a  fitting heavy and groovy soundtrack, and never holds back on the gore.  The dialogue is hokey and full of Mexican puns, but it knows this.  Machete loves to poke fun at itself and its ridiculous concepts, with  characters questioning certain events in the movie, realizations that  everything is insane, and an awesome B-movie touch that graces the  opening of the end credits. Machete is Robert Rodriguez's most  enjoyable and best film to date. It's so fun, so amazing, and actually  provides a sort of a social political message, now with racial  profiling and immigration being a controversial Americana topic. It's  why Machete is such a great film for the times, and will be looked upon  as one of the culturally relevant films of the last couple years I'm  as shocked as you are.  Machete is the best action film of 2010 and is certainly one of the  best of the year. It's fantastic entertainment that I oh so highly  recommend you watch. Machete es...... Yes, excelente.

Before you watch this movie, take a look at the director's name again. Its a Robert Rodriguez movie through and through. Its one of those movie that has zero logic and purely comes under the tag of guilty-pleasure.Watch it for stupidly beautiful action sequence, beautiful girls like Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan being hot. Let me mention Michelle Rodriguez separately once more, not just because I always had a celebrity crush on her, but also because of her appearance in the climax scene. Pure Wow moment.In short this a guilty pleasure movie, supposed to make no sense whatsoever. Shout out to Robert De Niro. He was... interesting..

As I was in the theater watching "Machete", I could not help but see certain scenes and keep a list in my head of people who would hate this movie. When Machete (Danny Trejo) takes out the knife whose nickname he bears and cuts people's heads off, "people who hate violence in movie" made my list. When Sartana (Jessica Alba) takes a shower and leans against the wall in a way that millions of men probably fantasized about, "most, if not all, women" found its way onto my list. When Padre the Roman-Catholic priest (Cheech Marin) says "God has mercy. I don't." to a guy before blowing his brains out with a rifle, I couldn't help but mentally pencil in two other groups of people: Catholics, and people who hadn't seen "Grindhouse" (2007) when it came out in theaters three years ago.Well, I love violent action films, I think Jessica Alba is gorgeous, I am Catholic but am not easily offended, and I was one of a surprising few who saw the aforementioned ambitious tribute to B-movies of the 70's and 80's. Therefore, I enjoyed "Machete" a lot, but I imagine others would have to take it with a grain of salt."Machete", based on a fake trailer made exclusively for "Grindhouse" that director Robert Rodriguez decided to expand into a feature-length film, is not meant to be taken seriously. If anything, it's a clever film with a lot of great action sequences, intriguing characters, many interesting subplots, and a good story at its base. For starters, it also has an impressive roster of talented actors in it. There is an interesting mix of the usual Rodriguez players (Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Jeff Fahey), really good actors (Robert De Niro), notoriously bad actors (Steven Seagal, Don Johnson), and talented players that have made some bad film choices over the last few years (Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan). The funny thing is that, good or bad, most of these actors seem perfect fits for this movie, and work well off each other.Trejo may have been an action star if he came to fame in 1970's cinema. Nowadays, it's not unusual to see good looking celebrities like Tom Cruise and Ryan Reynolds headline action films. Thankfully, Rodriguez, like Quentin Tarantino (who co-produced this film, but for some reason, remained uncredited) saw something in this 66-year-old ex-convict, because Trejo makes a great lead for an action film. Just one look at him, and you may want to start running. He's rugged, doesn't take any crap from anyone, and it is what action stars should be. It's just too bad the villains in this movie are not aware of that fact, and there are many villains.There's Torrez (Steven Seagal), a drug kingpin who betrayed Machete while he was a Federale in Mexico. There's Booth (Jeff Fahey) who hires Machete to assassinate a Republican senator (De Niro) who's staunchly against illegal immigration. There's also a corrupt border patrolman (Don Johnson) who kills illegal immigrants with no mercy. Although Jessica Alba plays an INS agent, you really can't stay mad at her for long.Although "Death Proof" and "Planet Terror" found a separate following on DVD, "Grindhouse", which combined the two films along with fake previews, did not do well at the box office despite rave reviews. So the timing may have been bad for "Machete" had it not been for the controversial Arizona immigration law that coincidentally coincided with this film's release. Whether or not this movie can be seen as a Hispanic-American revenge fantasy is not up to me to decide, although Michelle Rodriguez's turn as Luz, who is suspected of aiding illegal immigrants, raises some interesting questions. The film does seem to forget that it's a parody of exploitation films of years past at times, but never ceases from being fun. Just as Rodriguez brought "Machete" from a coming attraction to a feature film, I hope Rob Zombie does the same for his "Werewolf Women of the SS" preview.

Hands down, Machete is one exciting ride! Robert Rodriguez fans won't be disappointed. The acting was great, setting the mood of the film. The effects and action scenes were over-the-top awesome! To be honest, this film felt that this has more testosterone than recent action movie, The Expendables, which I believe nobody have seen that coming!Danny Trejo plays Machete. Worked as a fed in Mexico few years ago. But in the present time, he's an illegal alien tryng to make a living in Texas doing several jobs here and there. Until one day, a millionaire name Booth (Jeff Fahey) gives him a reward of $150,000 to assassinate the Senator of Texas (Robert De Niro). When Machete had the chance to take Senator McLaughlin down, he had been double-crossed. Thats when things get wild!In conclusion, it is one very entertaining film. Sure, there are a few dull/cheesy scenes like Alba's "Border crossed us!" quote and Lindsay Lohan playing as herself but easily forgiven because the majority of this flick is constant action and comedy! Machete is a must-see film to conclude the summer blockbusters of 2010.

I' try to keep it short and to the point. The action scenes were boring and the only thing that made this movie watchable was the star cast and some one-liner jokes. Don't get me wrong, I thought there were some good scenes in this movie but not enough to make a full length motion picture worthwhile. I suggest you (re)watch Grindhouse and Desperado instead of this mess of poor gore action and politics.PS! Why does Machete have 6 throwing knives and a bunch of machetes under his coat when he only uses the one in his hand?! Also Segal has gained enough weight to not be suitable for any action apparently so all scenes that required any movement at all were filmed with a double from behind and the 1 minute end fight was really boring. So my question is why give him any martial arts scenes to begin with?

I caught a screening of this film not too long ago, and all I have to say is that it was an adrenaline rush! The violence was overwhelming, and the writing was cornily witty. Pretty good performances all around from Alba, Trejo, DeNiro, Seagal, Lohan and many a more. Great entertainment, perfect to sit down with some buddies on a Saturday night and have a good laugh.No doubt in my mind this will do well in the box office, and well, not so well with the critics. But forget what the critics say this is a great flick, and a damn fun one too!Plot: After being betrayed by the organization who hired him, an ex-Federale launches a brutal rampage of revenge against his former boss.usualfilmfan

I'd hadn't heard much about this film, I hadn't seen the trailer or even the fake trailer attached to Grindhouse. I ended up randomly seeing this film anyway, and wow! The film is very OTT, it's extremely gruesome, crude, and a lot of fun. It is definitely not everybody's cup of tea, probably too absurd for a lot, but I liked it. It dragged in parts, but it was still very entertaining in a fun way. Just don't expect anything serious or believable. Basically, in case you don't know the story, Danny Trejo plays Machete, an ex ferale whos wife is brutally murdered, and who subsequently goes on an epic rampage to get revenge. There's nothing new here in the story, which is brief and to the point. Don't expect something intelligent, leave your brain at the door for this one. All in all it is good old fashioned mindless fun, but as I said it did start to get tiresome after a while (how long can you sit and watch a 60 year old man running around Amierca killing people with a machete?) It is still worth a watch, definitely if your into action packed splatter fests and B movies.

I have a question for a lot of the positive reviewers on here: Did you REALLY like this movie, or are you just gushing out of respect for Rodriguez??? I'm a Rodriguez fan too, in case you didn't know. Tarantino and Rodriguez are the kings of b-movies. They know how to make a good b-movie and their extensive filmography has shown. With Tarantino you have Kill Bill, Jackie Brown and Inglourious Basterds, with Rodiriguez you have Planet Terror, From Dusk Till Dawn and the king of all things "Visually gorgeous", Sin City. What I love about both of them is that while their films are indeed exercises in Style Over Substance, they're aware of it and don't take themselves too seriously.I still stand by Grindhouse as the most fun I've had at the theatre. Two great movies from two fantastic directors with some hilarious fake trailers thrown in there for the price of one. After "Hobo With A Shotgun", "Machete" showed. I laughed so hard! And then the news broke that Machete was going to be a full movie. I was excited.Turns out, some fake trailers should just stay fake trailers.As I mentioned earlier, Rodriguez's films are Style Over Substance. But they are aware of it, and don't take themselves too seriously, and for that, come off as awesome. Was this movie Style Over Substance? Yes. Did it follow its "Don't take yourself too seriously" rule? Well, it did... for the first 20 minutes.I was liking the first 20 minutes. Even as a gore hound, I was wondering if I should be eating during that scene! Then of course, we get the awesome betrayal scene and the hospital scene... I especially loved when Machete cut the man's abdomen open and used his intestine as a rope to escape through a window. I laughed!!! Then it went downhill from there.First off, Jessica Alba was annoying. Take her out of the movie and it wouldn't be different. All she does is just run around and scream the plot out loud. The most cringe worthy scene was near the end when she got up on the bonnet of the car and made that speech. That brought back memories of "Robin Hood" of earlier this year (you know what scene I'm talking about). Second, this film has too much plot in it, and too many characters. For a movie that's supposed to be a b-flick, this movie shouldn't be about political mumbo jumbo.The characters are a big letdown here. Or at least the representation of characters. Let's begin. "She" is a great character. About halfway through the film she is killed off... then near the end she survived!!! Or the Priest. He is a likable character too. Then he gets killed off 5 minutes after his first appearance. Or what about Daryl Sabara's character? He's a funny guy and he has (what feels like) 30 seconds of screen time... and yet he's one of the main actors in the opening credits!!! Bigger yet, what about the villain? WHO'S THE VILLAIN? Is it Segal, who has a total of 6 minutes of screen time, De Niro, or Fahey, who easily out of the three supposed villains gets the most screen time... except he dies 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLIMAX. Or Lindsay Lohan... why is she even in there, other than the fact that she's Fahey's character's daughter??? The climax is a total anticlimax. There's no excitement in the battle at all, it's incredibly dull and boring. Even the iconic bit shown in the trailer with the bike was underwhelming. And Segal's character's death even felt copped out and lazy.By the time the film was done, I was so glad I was out of the theatre. The film bored me enough with its slow pace. For a movie that claims to be an ultra gory action b-flick, there's about 10 minutes of action, 90 minutes of boring dialogue. This is supposed to be a b-movie, not some political crap. I like slow paced films, but not when they're supposed to be fun b-movies.Sorry, Mr. Rodriguez, but I think your days are numbered!

Of all the movies i have EVER seen in a theater.....i can say with no doubts in my mind, that the most fun i have ever had, was with 2007's "Grindhouse". It is cinematic fun at it's purest. It reminded me why it is still fun to go to the movies. So when i heard that they were making one of the fake previews into an actual full length feature, i became just as excited as i did 3 years ago.Okay, just so i am clear with everyone......i am aware, and i appreciate the difference between "Dumb/Funny" and "Dumb/Dumb". And by that i mean it's funny when a movie is being dumb on purpose. I love it, and i laugh hysterically. A good example of this would be "Planet Terror" or "Evil Dead". But sometimes, the movie can get a little ahead of itself and not focus on making the story fun as well, which is a key element if you want your movie to be considered a fun "B" movie. "Machete" fell into the category of Dumb/Dumb.....which to me is a major disappointment.Dare i say that the movie lost focus of actually being a "Grindhouse" movie? You bet i do. It was clear that Robert Rodriguez was aiming this story towards the recent events that are taking place in Arizona. By making stupid inspirational lines of dialogue that were not entertaining, but boring as all hell. Needless to say, it felt like a movie that was trying to make a political statement, as opposed to a cheesy drive-in action flick. Don't get me wrong, the movie had a few elements that would pop out and make you laugh, just like you were hoping for........but they were not at every turn. In fact, you were almost begging for them. And it was due to this........first off, i love Danny Trejo, and i think him as a main character is awesome......but he came off as so dull and lifeless, it was almost hard to root for him. Secondly, the action was fun, but it came in very small doses. Which is really surprising to me, because Rodriguez is normally a huge fan of blowing up everything.....and i thought he was going to go over the top with this one because, well, it's suppose to be a 70's type action flick. Instead, it just came off as dull and half witted.Bottom Line......i gotta be honest, I'm a little upset with this one. I had really high expectations, and this movie fell way short of them. In my opinion, Rodriguez can't make sequels. To sum it up......he did the same thing to "Grindhouse", that he did to "Desperado". So if you actually liked the movie "Once Upon a Time in Mexico", then maybe you'll like this. But i gotta tell ya, it certainly isn't the Grindhouse spin-off i was hoping for.

I'm not going to lie, the first thing that struck me was the glaring political messages in this movie. They are ridiculously one-dimensional and reappear throughout the movie; they serve no purpose but to support the loosening of illegal immigration enforcement on the Mexico-US border.Everything else basically followed your generic American action movie: killings, sex, a simple plot that is not too difficult for the audience, etc. After watching 30 minutes of the movie, I was already sick of it. It may be "brainless fun," but, although it is definitely brainless, it managed to not entertain me even when employing stars like Deniro to its obvious cause. Trashy movie that is not worthy of an 8/10.

MACHETEThis film started out as a fake trailer for the middle of the Tarrantino / Rodriguez film Gindhouse. It was a great touch and I was glad that the film was made in the end.The story is about a guy named Machete who is framed for the attempted murder of a senator who is trying to stop illegal immigrants.This film is super violent. As soon as the film starts you can tell what kind of movie this is going to be. Within the first 5 minutes there are be headings and loss of limbs. There is blood everywhere. It is completely unrealistic but fantastic at the same time. It was made as if it was a 70s slasher film. You have everything in it to make you think this is a really old film, yet it was made in 2010.I love the vision Rodriguez has for his films. He has clear influences that he uses and he does it so well.There are some hilarious moments in this film too. It was made like that on purpose. The tongue in cheek moments were brilliant. This has everything you would expect from a film like this. Blood, guts, nudity, bad language and terrible acting... but the bad acting was done on purpose because that is how it was back in the 70s.Because the acting was bad it means the actors actually did a brilliant job. The movie stars Danny Trejo﻿ as Machete. I love Danny. It is about time he got a leading role for himself. He has been in so many good movies and deserves the recognition. Other great cast members were Robert DeNiro, Jessica Alba, Steven Seagal, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and Lindsay Lohan﻿. I can't fault anyone at all... the perfect cast for this kind of film.The effects were over the top... on purpose. They looked great. I loved the scene where Machete was hanging from a window by some elses intestines. Really badly done, but hilarious!Honestly this film has everything. You need to watch it to believe it. I can't wait to see Machete Kills.I will give this film 7 out of 10."Machete don't text"For more reviews, please like me Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

In Mexico, the determinate federal agent Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) opposes to the order of his chief and drives with his partner to the hideout of the drug lord Rogelio Torrez (Steven Seagal) to rescue an abducted woman (Mayra Leal) that is witness against the gangster. However, he finds the witness naked on the bed but he is surprisingly betrayed by her, and his wife and daughter are murdered by Torrez. Three years later, Machete is an illegal immigrant in Texas that wanders on the streets seeking job in the Day Labor Site. He is hired by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to assassinate the boasting right-winged Senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro), who is against the immigrants and defends the construction of an electrified fence along the border with Mexico. Machete receives one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the assignment, but he gives the money to Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), a Mexican woman that sells taco in her truck and manages the underground Network that assists illegal Mexicans and helped Machete three years ago.When Machete is ready as a sniper in a tower, he finds that he has been betrayed and set up by Booth, who actually is McLaughlin's adviser and plotted the scheme to improve the statistics with the sympathy of the electors to McLaughlin. Once again Machete survives and discovers that Booth supports the vigilantes led by the cruel Von Jackson (Don Johnson) and is associated to Torrez. Now Machete seeks revenge against his enemies and becomes a myth."Machete" is a funny action movie and THE FILM of Danny Trejo that perfectly fits to the anti-hero. The story follows the style of B- movies, with exploitation and ultra-violence, but has a cast that is a constellation of stars. There are memorable lines (my favorite is when the priest says "God has mercy, I don't") and details, like the name of the garage (Machete's Chop Shop). I have just watched this film on DVD, and the deleted scenes shows many details of the story that unfortunately have been deleted in the edition, like the twin sister of Sartana Rivera "Sis", or Rose McGowan as the assassin "Boots McCoy". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Machete"Note: On 22 September 2015, I saw this film again.

I am aware that Rodriguez isn't some kind of marvelous director who makes classics on every turn. Still, I'm thankful to the guy for giving us "Spy Kids", "El Mariachi", "Desperado" and "Once Upon a Time in Mexico". That collaboration with Tarantino is good, but I don't count it as solo work, same as "Sin city". And then he makes a movie based on a trailer featured in a "Grindhouse", a mentioned collaboration with Tarantino, which features Danny Trejo as a machete wielding anti-hero. Film is a classic exploitation movie, with a lot of action, gore, nudity and cheesy characters. And all of that is intended. If that seems fun, then I recommend that you watch it. If that seems tasteless (it is) and like wasting of time, don't watch it. Easy as that. It's a fun way to spend some time and that's all :D 7.5/10 from me :D

Machete is one of those films that you know what to expect before you go in. It is understood that this is an exploitation flick, which will have excessive violence, sex and nudity. What pleased me most about this film, that as well as that (which should be minimal expectation before going in), it has a well told cohesive story and some real power house acting. I am a big fan of Rodriguez's earlier film, 'Desperado,' and Machete is similar to that; except where Desperado took itself seriously, this film has its tongue firmly in cheek and from this you get a lot of the humour - and it works. From start, all the way through to the finish, there is something happening that keeps you glued to the screen. Perfect to watch in a group, especially if some of them have a low attention span. Limits have been pushed and I love it. It is not excessive violence for random excessive violence sake; it's been thought about and works extremely well in regard to the story and tone of the film. I would describe 'Planet Terror' as a practice for what Rodriguez wanted that didn't quite deliver and Machete as the masterpiece - that delivers on all cylinders. I cannot recommend this film enough as a riotous laugh out loud, violent and engaging experience.

I love this movie and i expect it to be one of those i will watch again now and then.Solid performances all over, good lines, lots of laughs, naked women. I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm impressed that a movie like this can come out of virtually nothing. It all starts with a fake movie trailer and an idea of something that everyone's seen before. Tough guy's revenge against the villain who took away X's life. Blahblahblah. But the end result here is just brilliant.Having said all that there is 1 thing i think could have been done better. Trejos character is pretty much a monkey with few lines and generally portrayed as a bit dumb. I can't help thinking he could have pulled off a slightly more interesting character. I totally realize he's supposed to be old school muscles and pulls that off well, but it's like they thought "hey this is going to be cheese with cheese on so don't bother".That is not to say he's bad, I just can't help thinking there was a bit of potential that went unexplored. Nonetheless a must-see!

There are a number of great Mexploitation films. "El Mariachi," "Desperado" and "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" all come to mind. Not only were those films action-packed and entertaining, but they contained good plots which one could follow without losing interest.Then, there's "Machete." I'll keep things honest, seeing as (apparently) the only submitted reviews were done by film crew members.The movie starts out well. In the first scene, Machete (and his partner, who dies almost immediately) storms into a drug cartel, wreaking havoc against armed goons with nothing but his (get ready) machete. He kills about a dozen people, rescuing a naked female hostage in the process. However, as they're leaving the cartel hideout, she betrays Machete to the cartel's leader, a man named Torrez (played by Steven Seagal). Machete being subdued, Torrez tortures Machete but decides not to kill him. Instead, he kills Machete's wife and child and leaves Machete alive so that he can suffer for the rest of his life.Yes, it's simple, but the movie actually looked quite good up until this point. Then, the nightmare began.Rather than construct a decent story and continue with the main plot (i.e., a man with nothing to lose trying to avenge the deaths of his wife and child), the movie veers off into a tirade of politicizations and hate-mongering. It portrays white conservatives (get ready for some originality) as racist red-necks who are hell-bent on killing Mexicans for sheer enjoyment. It even shows a U.S. Senator (played by Robert De Niro) killing a pregnant illegal alien and her spouse, saying afterward, "My supporters would love this" (paraphrase).(Yes, Hollywood, people are not against illegal immigration because it destroys the Rule of Law, hurts the economy, increases unemployment, increases violent crime, puts financial burdens on tax-payers, etc. - it's because they hate Hispanics).Before continuing, I just want to mention that the writer of this review is the product of a Hispanic father. OK, here we go.As already mentioned, after the opening sequence, the movie becomes overtly political. The aforementioned senator (played by De Niro) is seen campaigning for re-election, his main political platform being the construction of a border-fence designed to keep out illegal aliens (the horror!). However, many people in power are against this, and they hire Machete (now a day-laborer) to assassinate the senator. Of course, as indicated by the coming attractions, Machete is betrayed by the very people who hire him, and it is revealed that they are, in fact, working for the very cartel leader who killed Machete's family (what a startling coincidence!). It turns out that Machete was only hired to arouse public sympathy for the senator and increase the public's demand for a border fence (which Torrez, the cartel leader who killed Machete's family, wants, given that then he can control the drug trade between the Mexican-U.S. border).The story gets very boring, with immigration politics ascending into the forefront. The action slows down to a grinding halt, and the story devolves into simple political platitudes (check out Jessica Alba's call for a race-war near the end of the movie, demanding that illegal immigrants incite violence in order to acquire citizenship).In conclusion, this movie sucks. Mr. Rodriguez, I want my money back.

'MACHETE': Five Stars (Out of Five) The long awaited feature film based on writer / director Robert Rodriguez's beloved 'fake' trailer 'MACHETE' is finally here and it doesn't disappoint. The trailer was featured prior to Rodriguez's entry 'PLANET TERROR' in his and buddy Quentin Tarantino's 'GRINDHOUSE' double feature from 2007. These films are designed to imitate the popular 'B' exploitation films of the 70's and 80's that were typically played at rundown theaters known as 'grindhouses'. 'MACHETE' is an homage to 'Mexploitation' films and was originally conceived as just a satirical trailer but later evolved into a full feature length film due to it's popularity. Writer / director Eli Roth's fake trailer 'THANKSGIVING' is also rumored to be developed in to a full feature. Rodriguez supposedly filmed half of the movie while he was making the trailer and Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo all reprise their roles from it (This is actually Trejo's fifth time playing the 'Machete' character, he also played him in all three 'SPY KIDS' films). Rodriguez credits his buddy Ethan Maniquis as a co-director on the film and cousin Alvaro as a co-writer.Long time character actor 'tough guy' Danny Trejo finally gets his first starring role, at age 66! He plays the iconic 'Machete', an ex Federale who as the film opens is betrayed by his boss and ex-partner Torrez (played by none other than Steven Seagal), who's now a vicious drug lord. His wife and daughter are murdered and he's left for dead. Three years later he's now an illegal immigrant looking for day labor in Texas. He's discovered by a businessman named Booth (Fahey) and hired to assassinate a Senator (played by Robert De Niro) who's radical illegal immigration stance is seen as bad for business. He's betrayed by his employers though and now a wanted fugitive. This of course turns into a very violent revenge tale as Machete teams up with a beautiful ICE agent (played by Jessica Alba), a tough resistance fighter (played by Michelle Rodriguez) and his brother who's now a priest (played by Cheech Marin).The film is packed with gruesome and over the top violence as well as the prerequisite explicit sex and nudity these films are known for. It's also full of witty and humorous dialog (including my favorite line 'Machete don't text') as well as a surprising amount of social and political commentary. This movie actually has a heart and an important message behind it's rough and tough exterior. It's nothing short of a masterpiece in my opinion. I love these types of movies. Rodriguez is one of my favorite directors (and writers) although I'm not a big fan of his kids' films; I love almost everything else he does though. In my opinion he's up there with Quentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson, Kevin Smith, etc. He's one of the great ones and this film is as well. It's everything I expected; a beautiful homage to 70's and 80's B action films. Like 'THE EXPENDABLES' it's nostalgia Heaven!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4rYA-j3f3c

First time encounter with Machete was from those Grindhouse commercials. So when the movie came out I expected a joyous experience.Machete delivers almost every scene and it's a high paced action-comedy. If you're watching it today, the resemblance to the current presidency of Donald Trump shines out through the whole movie.Easy to watch and maybe an ice-breaker with friends on weekends. (People with over analytical personalities might not enjoy it as much as you or me.)

Robert Rodriguez strikes (out) again. Stringing together some cruel moments of gore with lame comedy, a few bare breasts (how people can rave about the copious nudity in this movie when there's hardly anything on show is beside me), heavy-handed political satire which makes his sincere message come across as racist stupidity and some of the least exciting action scenes ever, Machete is a complete failure. Acting performances are weak across the board, and Danny Trejo is a frightening figure, yet he doesn't cut it (ooh, look, I made a pun) as an interesting lead character. He doesn't have the charisma to transcend the extreme simplicity of the character. And while I know he could crush me with his bare hands, he certainly doesn't convince when going up against villainous henchmen half his age. The finale is the worst part of the film. The heroic Mexicans attack the racist American vigilantes, and much slaughter ensues, but without any tension at all, with extremely weak choreography and telegraphed 'cool' moments referencing 'classic' exploitation characters which are largely embarrassing. Nothing is quite as embarrassing as the final battle between Trejo and Steven Seagal, though. No choreography to speak of, shot and edited in the least effective way (I've seen better fights in TV-series), and with an utterly lame ending, it has absolutely no redeeming features. Except that it's short (barely one minute of screen time). Maybe one day Rodriguez will accept the fact that he can't write or tell stories, and start working from scripts by other people who can. Until that day, we'll be stuck with crap like Machete, however.
