I saw this movie on a girls-night-out to the movies, and we chose it on the basis of the previews, which had billed it as a romantic comedy. Wow, were they ever wrong! The basic plot is this: Woman loses husband far too early and tragically. Woman grieves for husband, hard. Husband, through a plan pre-arranged before his death, sends woman letters at set intervals, each one causing a fresh stream of tears to fall.The acting was great. Hillary Swank was particularly good in her role, and let us see her vulnerability and conflicting emotions. The supporting cast was all excellent, and ladies, there is more than enough male eye candy in this movie to go around.But - and I strongly warn all of you considering this as a light comedy or a date movie - it's sad. Very very sad. Even the happy parts are sad. If you go see this, wear waterproof mascara and bring lots of tissues. Don't say I didn't warn you.

(Synopsis) Holly (Hilary Swank) has been married nine years to a wild Irishman, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler), and her one true love. Unfortunately for Holly, Gerry is diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor. Knowing he only has a short time to live; Gerry writes Holly a series of letters that will guide her through her grief. The first message arrives on Holly's 30th birthday. Gerry has sent her a birthday cake and a tape recording explaining the letters that she will be getting in the mail. Over the next year, Gerry wants Holly to follow the orders in his letters by going on new adventures and to celebrate life by finding herself. Holly's best friends, Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon), accompany her on her journey. Gerry always signs off each letter with "P.S. I Love You." (My Comment) This is definitely a chick flick that will not only make you cry, but make you laugh, plus the women will fall in love with Gerard Butler. Gerard was excellent in his part and Hilary did a fine job as well. At first I didn't think Hilary could pull off the romantic comedy role, but in the end you get use to her doing it. Hilary actually makes you feel her pain and how devastated she was when her husband died. I guarantee you that you will tear up during several scenes. Overall it was an enjoyable chick flick that you can take a date. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:06, Rated PG-13) (7/10)

Generally speaking, I dislike the romantic American tearjerker dramas especially films like 'Titanic'. So i tend to avoid them. A few that I have liked include 'Far and Away' and 'The English Patient' (which was much more than the average movie of this genre). What interested me about 'P.S. I Love You' was the interesting ensemble cast. Now that I have watched the film, I must say that it came as a pleasant surprise.I found it very fresh: the cast which brings together talents like Lisa Kudrow, Kathy Bates and Hilary Swank; the idea of shooting in Ireland was very refreshing and the beautiful locations were so wonderfully shot that it just makes one want to visit the beautiful country; the screenplay, yes it is flawed as there are a few corny moments and some of the situations are a little too convenient but most of the dialogues are great, the comedic undertone is mostly welcoming and not misplaced, the ending is different from what one would expect; the soundtrack which adds more life into the moments.It's ironic that just the other day I watched 'Reign Over Me' which also dealt with 'grieving over' lost loved ones. Both films were totally different but it was interesting to see how the central character of both films deal, or more correctly, fail to cope with their losses in different ways. Both the writer and director LaGravenese put a lot of heart into 'P.S. I Love You' and the film is strengthened by the chemistry of the actors.Both Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler are excellent. The chemistry between them is electric. Swank gracefully shows Holly's transition from the whiny but loving working wife to the lonely widow. In a flashback scenes we see her brilliantly pull off the naive teenager. It's no surprise that the woman can act. Butler is terrific as the charming, lively and funny Gerry but his grasp of the Irish accent is disastrous. Lisa Kudrow provides comic relief. The actress gives a natural performance with shades of her famous Phoebe Buffay character (which I didn't mind as I miss Phoebe) but I wish she was given more screen time. Even Gina Gershon springs a surprise with a decent performance. Kathy Bates's acting is beautifully restrained. Harry Connick Jr. too adds some comedy (which might not appeal to all).'P.S. I Love You' makes for a good rainy day film. It might not appeal to all as there are a few fluffy corny moments but the film does make its point well and for me it was worth a watch.

I am often disappointed when I go to see a movie, and all the good parts that were shown in the trailer- were the ONLY good parts in the movie. This film, however, managed to live up to the trailer and many of the best moments of the film were left out of the trailer and for good reason, as to not ruin the surprises.I found Hillary Swank's character, Holly, to be believable in her grief and her inability to function after loosing the man she had been married to for 11 years to a brain tumor. I recently lost my mother to a brain tumor as well. I was able to empathize with her character in the feelings of loss and confusion. Through a series of letters her husband, Gerry, wrote prior to his death, Holly attempts to pick up her life and learn how to go on living without her husband. The movie is filled with flashbacks that show the viewer the type of life this couple had, coupled with moments in which Holly believes her husband to be 'there' with her. I cannot go without mentioning the great performance by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who plans an Irishman that Holly meets while on a trip back to her late husbands hometown. He's pretty nice to look at too. Overall, wonderful performances by both Gerard Butler and Jeffery Dean Morgan. Hillary Swank managed to carry the story well, in a genre she usually does not venture into, but has done well in film.

Holly (Hillary Swank) has been married for a number of years to handsome Gerry (Gerard Butler), an Irish gentleman. Wed at 19, he is the only love of her life and they have big plans for the future. Sadly, however, Gerry is stricken with cancer and dies, leaving Holly desolate. But, much to her surprise, letters start arriving from Gerry, under unusual circumstances, letters that provide encouragement for Holly to move forward with her life. Gerry suggests that Holly do some karaoke and take a trip to Ireland, where she should learn to fish and visit his relatives. It doesn't' hurt that Holly has two loving friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon), a hovering mother (Kathy Bates), and a good-looking new friend (Harry Connick, Jr.) looking out for her, also. But, can Holly truly overcome the serious blow that life has given her? This is a sweet movie but, I must confess, I was a wee bit disappointed. Yes, I loved the basic story and the cast is beyond terrific. Swank is quite nice as the young widow while Butler is greatly engaging as the husband, with many of his scenes told in flashback. In fact, Butler is a new favorite among American women, thanks to Dear Frankie, and let us all hope we see much more of him. Kudrow, Gershon, Bates, Connick Jr., and some of the Irish players are just right, too, breathing more life into a script that is erratic and sometimes contrived. Of course, the sets in Manhattan and Ireland are very wonderful, as are the costumes and great camera work. But, the film could have used more careful direction and editing, in my view. However, all fans of romantic comedy should not miss it, no. As the fountain of romcom films has considerably dried up in the last two years, any new entry is a hearty meal for the starving. Just do not expect another Music and Lyrics this time around.

People change in time, relationships change in time; Love doesn't. A man expresses his feelings of his love to his wife, through several shocking surprises after his death. This movie would tell why love is the only power that connects people, if no one could tell anymore what it really means. Gerry and Holly's relationship is a good example of how couples bring their love to the end quickly. Leading actors Swank and Butler accomplished wholeheartedly acting jobs. A true success with Harry Connick Jr.'s role playing Holly's first flirt, but poor acting from Jeffrey Dean Morgan(whom we'll see him in "Watchmen" next year) playing as her second. As a novel adaptation, the screenplay is effectual. Some parts of the script is totally noticeable that hold our attention continuously. I liked the editing job very well after I've seen the deleted scenes from the special features of the DVD. The music score is so relaxing and emotional. Everybody keeps telling this film is a tearjerker, which I disagree; it's only because of the sensational existence of Hilary Swank. Her talented way of expressing psychological trauma just catches eyes, that's all. There are 5 of my favorite scenes which I rewind each time I watch: 1*One of the greatest opening scenes for a romance of all time. In that scene just in 2 minutes, we get what type of personalities each character has. Lovers find a quarrel over a straw. They yell at each other, and Gerry leaves Holly getting out of the door. A minute passes or not, Holly comes back from bathroom and Gerry back from the door. Then they wildly lock in a close embrace after running towards to each other into the middle of the living room... 2*After the funeral of Gerry, at a time when Holly's longing of him hits the top, she can't help herself calling the home-phone from her cellphone just to listen to Gerry's voice from his answering machine record; while trying to sleep... 3*Holly's receiving of Gerry's first P.S.I Love You letter and his true guesses of what Holly is going to say in respond after his each time of gaffes... 4*Gerry's calling to memory of their first meeting in Ireland, from his words... 5*And best of all, my best favorite scene: Holly's return to karaoke stage singing "Love You Till The End" and imagining as if he is there forming a lonesome audience. This scene is the one I burst into tears. I don't remember myself crying because of a movie, or because of someone else's sadness ever; including the end of Dr.Zhivago or Love Story or The English Patient. Yet it just reminded me of a photo of my fiancée with whom we were parted away. In that photo she was standing on a step of an amphitheater watching my mockery of a stand-up show at the stage, forming the whole audience herself. This is a therapeutic relationship movie. Watch it with your partner and you'll be able to see the missing, lacking or the incomplete part of your unity. Strongly recommended for couples who used to be in love before. Find out why love is eternal.

I saw this last night at a free preview, and I had an idea of what it was about, and even though I knew the basic premise, I was still pleasantly surprised.It's a typical "girl" movie, in that it makes you laugh and cry! Don't go into the theater expecting to much, b/c I think you might get disappointed, but if you go in wanting to see a sweet movie, you'll love it! H. Swank might surprise you, and G. Butler is AMAZING! Ladies...you'll fall in love! Really you'll fall in love with all the male characters.Bring tissue, because even the strongest person might get a little choked up!!

1. You are past puberty 2. You value your free time 3. You dislike cheesy lines 4. You have suffered a real loss in life 5. You have a reasonable sense of humor 6. You don't enjoy a predictable story 7. You value your intelligence 8. The movie is wrongly classified as "drama romance", but it is really a romanticized, imaginary, phony, fantastic way that a teen or someone who is completely detached sees an adult life (a science fiction perhaps?). When you watch movies that are described as comedies, you know what to expect. But here, you are mislead into believing that this is grounded in real life. Well, it isn't. 9. You loved Hillary Swank in other movies and want to believe that she can distinguish a quality scenario.

As a guy, I have never been hit by a movie like this one. I went into this movie laying next to my girlfriend, expecting to be bored out of my mind. I watched it with her, for her. I never complained, and I'm glad I didn't. This movie reminded me so much of us, and how much I don't want to lose her. I believe the acting was superb on everybody's part, with humor very well done.I never look at ratings for a movie, I read the back, or watch the trailers, and listen to ratings by trusted people I know. Never trust the ratings online or by critics, in any genre. Someone brought up the ratings on rottentomatoes, did they notice that over 95% of those ratings were from males? Now why would anybody in their right mind listen to a bunch of reviews by GUYS on a CHICK FLICK? This movie was for anybody that has the joy of being madly in love, if you are not, you won't get it.The most powerful line to me was by the character, Daniel, "I want to be somebody's Gerry" was extremely powerful to me.

One of the better romantic dramas that I've seen. P.S. I Love You has a storyline that's at the same time just outlandish and exotic enough that it keeps you invested and excited, yet it's still just within the realm of possibility so that you can reflect on how you would react in a situation like the one in the film. Plus it's a rather sweet and touching story about love, loss and sometimes being unable to move on.The thing that impressed me to most, though, was the fact that the film actually acknowledged that we usually view our lost loved ones through rose-tinted glasses. Because we actually see Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) arguing before he passes away. And yet the rest of the film spends most of its time depicting Gerry as a saint. Thus it'd be so easy to call his character unrealistic and naive, if not for that arguing that turns the whole thing upside down, because in most cases it's Holly that's doing the depicting. And more often than not, we do like to remember our lost loves with fondness. So the movie nails that aspect of grieving rather perfectly. Though Gerry is still a rather amazing guy. I'd say a bit too amazing, but it's a romantic drama. It's wish-fulfillment.So the story works. Add in good characters, some interesting locations, Ireland and a rather colourful visual style and you have film that's a very nice way to spend a few hours. It's not going to challenge your view of the world or anything that extravagant, but it'll make you feel better, I guarantee. It's heart-rendering, sweet, lovable, sad and uplifting, all at the same time and it certainly has scenes that will stick with you. Especially the first meeting between Holly and Gerry. I loved that scene. And you should check it out as well.

I've felt the need to write the first movie review on my profile. If no news is good news, I have a lot of news. It started with some lame, god-awful song. The opening scene went from the characters, Holly and Gery, played by Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler (who had absolutely no chemistry at all), fighting to having sex. The second scene? Gery's funeral. What?! Oh right, a brain tumor, I guess...Because you weren't able to get to know Gery as a character, you weren't able to feel any emotion when he died. Then the whole movie focused around some letters he wrote before he died. He arranged them to be sent to Holly after he had passed. One told her to dress in a dreadful disco dress and sing some boring karaoke song at the bar all while being tone deaf. I didn't really understand the point of this.Did I mention the acting? Gag me. Remember when Sandra Bullock got an Oscar and a Razzie in the same year? Hilary Swank should have received a Razzie for this acting. Her acting in this movie was unemotional and very lacking. I'm talking about crying with a scrunched up face and no tears. Near the end when she buries her face into her mom's shoulder is when she didn't even have any tears. The comedy was a big fail. Holly and her two friends were on a boat. Their oars fell into the water and were FIVE FEET from the boat, so what did they do? Started screaming for help in the middle of the deserted lake and let the oars float away.I kept waiting for a laugh, kept waiting for something big to happen, kept waiting to be touched... Nothing. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this movie.

A film aimed squarely at a female audience, P.S. I LOVE YOU.Holly Kennedy (the handsome Hilary Swank) is a young widow who finds that her late husband (Gerard Butler) has left her a series of letters to help her start a new life. She follows the instructions in the letters and, with the help of her friends, embarks on a journey of self-discovery.Films about love and human relationships are films that I enjoy most. Sadly, I was not able to connect with this film on any satisfactory level.The film starts perfectly. The opening minutes show a dispute between Holly and her husband and this is well done, energised by hand-held, sometimes out of focus camera work. But the scene is far too drawn out and, after five minutes, starts to feel like a rough cut and becomes tiring.In fact, the whole film is too drawn out and, at times, rather clumsy. Some scenes labour to be moving, smothered in sorrowful music, which only serves to distance the audience.There's comedy in the form of Lisa Kudrow playing a supportive friend, a leprechaun singing telegram and an Asperger's suffering love interest (Harry Connick Jr.) who says exactly what he thinks without any consideration for those around him.There's a certain unfairness to the late husband's letters. While they are well-intentioned, Holly develops an unhealthy dependence on them. And the subplot involving her father's separation from her mother (Kathy Bates) feels "thrown in" and makes the film uneven.Equally poor is the use of coincidence late in the story and the final scene which involves a meeting.P.S. I LOVE YOU constantly, unashamedly, reaches for the heart - without any tact or subtlety - and fails to grasp. Unless you want it to. Unless you are willing to overlook its very contrived scenes and clumsy construction and go along for the ride, to indulge in the tissues.

Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) and husband Gerry (Gerard Butler) seem to have a happy marriage. Gerry dies of a brain tumor...but it seems he has arranged to have Holly sent messages AFTER his death telling her how to get on with her life.OK--I love silly romance movies. "Sleepless in Seattle" is one of my favorites. This is VERY silly--but I didn't like it. For starters there are WAY too many love songs in it--I was getting he impression they were trying to sell a soundtrack album and could care less about the movie. Also they (stupidly) keep using clips from classic movies that had nothing to do with the plot. Seriously--WHY is Holly lip syncing to Judy Garland belting out "The Man Who Got Away"? Also the love "lessons" here are utterly predictable. It's far too long (over 2 hours), is flatly directed and badly staged. Also some really bad acting doesn't help--Kathy Bates looks blank, Lisa Kudrow is astonishingly lousy at the comic bits (that's inexcusable for someone who was on "Friends") and James Marsters is given nothing to do. Also Hilary Swank (a wonderful actress) can't do much with a horribly clichéd role. The plot rambles all over the place and there are WAY too many coincidences to believe in this.The few good points: There's a trip to Ireland and the movie makes good use of the beautiful locations there; Gina Gershon is just great in a small role; there's a nice flash of male nudity; Jeffrey Dean Morgan is just great as William (a guy Holly meets in Ireland) and Gerard Butler is fantastic. He's not in the movie too much and he overacts, but his performance is so good and he's so likable and handsome that he gives the movie a much needed jump start.Critics have savaged this. Now it's not good--but it's not a total bomb either. Butler made this movie bearable. I give it a 6.

When I saw this movie for the first time, I had just lost my husband. His death happened suddenly. I didn't have time to say goodbye.I was full of questions and couldn't find the answers. I kept asking myself WHY.And then, I read the book and watched the movie.And suddenly everything made sense.The answers to my questions were that sometimes there are things for which there's no explanation.I love this movie.I SIMPLY LOVE IT.The actors, the performances, photography, everything is just perfect.It's a movie that will help you heal.The message is of life, love.That even when your heart is crying, you can heal. That even when you are at your worst, life will prevail.Enjoy it.

2020 edit; Everyone sucks at least a little bit in this film, but for a good cry it's always on my list. Films like this are the reason we need story--to help us process our own emotions. When my tears are locked up, this has me sobbing in 10 minutes.
*Types through thick salty tears*If you love to have your heartbroken into a million pieces, then this is the movie for you! I avoided this film for a long time because I knew the general storyline, and I wasn't okay with it. I didn't feel the need to deliberately upset myself by viewing it. But after watching this beautiful film I highly recommend it to everyone. A stellar performance from Hilary and Gerard, the chemistry they share makes you forget you're watching a film.

Fell in love with the movie that brings you the harsh reality of life. Before watching the movie I personally didn't like the lead casts but the on screen chemistry between Swank and Butler is good. The soundtrack is cool. A special mention to 'Fairytale of New York' song played at the start (Lyrics not suitable for children). Even though the movie carried some comic scenes, it is sentimental in most parts which are lovable, in my opinion. It is difficult to see characters in Hollywood like Holly who is a loyal wife to Gerry. The conversation between the mother and the daughter at the end is my favorite part. Must appreciate the camera shots in Ireland and were good. The bottom line : many of you who read the review may not agree with my ratings but this one is heartwarming and you can watch it once with your loved ones.

Please understand, I am commenting on the film and not the book here, the book was fantastic, funny,sad, warm really true to life, Holly had a great family, brothers and a sister who all had different tales to tell, I felt a part of this family, I loved the way they all got together at Christmas and at the barbecue.My favorite part in the book was when the younger brother filmed the girls on a night out and then won a prize!!!!!! The sad part was when Holly's elder brother was made redundant and his wife left him!!! Holly coped with all of these problems and worries as would have been expected of someone in her situation When Gerry went into the travel agents and booked the tickets for Holly and her friends was a very touching scene and I read it over and over How can the author let the film makers do this to her fantastic book how disappointed was I to see the film, there was only one thing in common with the book "Gerry died" and that was all The book was in Ireland, the film was in New York, the family was a warm and comforting one in Irealand, the film had a sister who was hardly present and the mother a sad old cow whose husband had left her NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BOOK Why do you guys buy books and then change them? If the book is a success then do the film as was the book I think that the people who never read the book will probably love the film, I think that the people who read the book and then saw the film will probably hate it Sorry to be so negative, however I am really angry at seeing a great book completely ruined Thanks for listening I feel better now

I was lucky enough to get advance screening tickets to go see this movie. I loved it! It is very funny and very romantic. It stars Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler (that gorgeous hunk of man who starred in 300, if you haven't seen it--go rent it).At the start of the movie, Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) are married and they are having a marital spat, which, trust me, is hilarious. Let's just say they end the fight with him doing a very funny striptease. In the next scene, we find that he has died. Holly is so bereaved she is unable to function but soon letters start arriving--from Gerry. He spaces the letters about a month apart and in each letter he teaches Holly how to get on with the business of living.Her ensuing adventures with best friends, Lisa Kudrow and Lisa Gershon are hilarious. Along the way, she meets Harry Connick, Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (who played Denny in Grey's Anatomy). The supporting cast is wonderful (especially the hilarious Lisa Kudrow). The movie is very funny, much more funny than sad. And Gerard Butler is quite terrific in it (and I am not just saying that because I am a fan). He is romantic, sexy, and just plain sweet. The striptease scene alone is worth the price of admission. I never laughed so hard.Hilary Swank is very, very good. She and Gerry have really great chemistry. In the scenes they have together, you totally see how much in love they are with each other and why Holly is so bereaved when he dies. Although the movie does stray from the book at times, in my opinion it's an improvement. For example, Gerard Butler is not only in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie, but he is also in it quite a bit through flashbacks and such. Plus you get to hear him sing (which he has not done in a movie since "The Phantom of the Opera").So if you get a chance this holiday season, go see this wonderful romantic, funny movie. You will love it! Amy V.

I am so glad I went against the many negative reviews of this movie... because it was fantastic! It has stuck with me in the several hours since I've seen it. Claims that Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler have no chemistry just are not true- the characters are different, and they clash at times, but this shouldn't be misconstrued. One can definitely see the love they have for each other, though the ways they express it are very different. Never has a movie pushed me to the brink of tears so many times! Sure, in Titanic we all (or was it just me...?) cried when we realized Leo's character had died, but P.S. I Love You brings that feeling several times over. It is so relatable- how would we act if we were completely grief-stricken with nothing to comfort us? I love this movie- both my friend that saw it with me and myself fully intend on buying it on DVD when it is released. Highly recommended. Don't forget Kleenex! *Kudos to Kudrow who is freaking hilarious!*

However, all fans of romantic comedy should not miss it, no. As the fountain of romcom films has considerably dried up in the last two years, any new entry is a hearty meal for the starving. Just do not expect another Music and Lyrics this time around.

As a husband who has a wife battling for her life with recurrent ovarian cancer, this movie struck very close to home. We a both in our late 20's and I am facing the possibility of burying my wife far to young, so suffice to say we both went to the movie and had a hard time keeping the eyes dry. There is nothing worse then prospect or actuality of burying your lover and your friend. I know this movie got a lot of negative reviews but when you see your life mirrored on the big screen you can't help but be moved by her struggle to move on and his undying love for her. I see another reviewer said to keep the boyfriends/husbands home, these people obviously have not faced such tragic circumstances. Usually I'd be the first to tear apart a click flick, but this didn't feel as cliché as most and I liked how the ending wasn't as predictable as click flick movies usually are.

This movie will make you cry and make you fall in love with Gerlad Butler(what a guy what an accent yum) definitely a chick flick my friend was crying by the second scene however in amongst all the sniffles was some laughs and overall I did enjoy the movie. While Gerlad and Jeffrey Morgan were both excellent Hillary well it's not that she was bad, just unexpected I'm not used to seeing her play this type of part and I just don't think she is suited to the role would the movie have been better without her probably not a standard rom-com actress definitely would have pushed it over the edge into bad territory. Overall an enjoyable chick flick definitely one to take your mum and girlfriends to just don't forget the tissues !

People change in time, relationships change in time; Love doesn't. A man expresses his feelings of his love to his wife, through several shocking surprises after his death. This movie would tell why love is the only power that connects people, if no one could tell anymore what it really means. Gerry and Holly's relationship is a good example of how couples bring their love to the end quickly. Leading actors Swank and Butler accomplished wholeheartedly acting jobs. A true success with Harry Connick Jr.'s role playing Holly's first flirt, but poor acting from Jeffrey Dean Morgan(whom we'll see him in "Watchmen" next year) playing as her second. As a novel adaptation, the screenplay is effectual. Some parts of the script is totally noticeable that hold our attention continuously. I liked the editing job very well after I've seen the deleted scenes from the special features of the DVD. The music score is so relaxing and emotional. Everybody keeps telling this film is a tearjerker, which I disagree; it's only because of the sensational existence of Hilary Swank. Her talented way of expressing psychological trauma just catches eyes, that's all. There are 5 of my favorite scenes which I rewind each time I watch: 1*One of the greatest opening scenes for a romance of all time. In that scene just in 2 minutes, we get what type of personalities each character has. Lovers find a quarrel over a straw. They yell at each other, and Gerry leaves Holly getting out of the door. A minute passes or not, Holly comes back from bathroom and Gerry back from the door. Then they wildly lock in a close embrace after running towards to each other into the middle of the living room... 2*After the funeral of Gerry, at a time when Holly's longing of him hits the top, she can't help herself calling the home-phone from her cellphone just to listen to Gerry's voice from his answering machine record; while trying to sleep... 3*Holly's receiving of Gerry's first P.S.I Love You letter and his true guesses of what Holly is going to say in respond after his each time of gaffes... 4*Gerry's calling to memory of their first meeting in Ireland, from his words... 5*And best of all, my best favorite scene: Holly's return to karaoke stage singing "Love You Till The End" and imagining as if he is there forming a lonesome audience. This scene is the one I burst into tears. I don't remember myself crying because of a movie, or because of someone else's sadness ever; including the end of Dr.Zhivago or Love Story or The English Patient. Yet it just reminded me of a photo of my fiancée with whom we were parted away. In that photo she was standing on a step of an amphitheater watching my mockery of a stand-up show at the stage, forming the whole audience herself. This is a therapeutic relationship movie. Watch it with your partner and you'll be able to see the missing, lacking or the incomplete part of your unity. Strongly recommended for couples who used to be in love before. Find out why love is eternal.

I saw this last night at a free preview, and I had an idea of what it was about, and even though I knew the basic premise, I was still pleasantly surprised.It's a typical "girl" movie, in that it makes you laugh and cry! Don't go into the theater expecting to much, b/c I think you might get disappointed, but if you go in wanting to see a sweet movie, you'll love it! H. Swank might surprise you, and G. Butler is AMAZING! Ladies...you'll fall in love! Really you'll fall in love with all the male characters.Bring tissue, because even the strongest person might get a little choked up!!

1. You are past puberty 2. You value your free time 3. You dislike cheesy lines 4. You have suffered a real loss in life 5. You have a reasonable sense of humor 6. You don't enjoy a predictable story 7. You value your intelligence 8. The movie is wrongly classified as "drama romance", but it is really a romanticized, imaginary, phony, fantastic way that a teen or someone who is completely detached sees an adult life (a science fiction perhaps?). When you watch movies that are described as comedies, you know what to expect. But here, you are mislead into believing that this is grounded in real life. Well, it isn't. 9. You loved Hillary Swank in other movies and want to believe that she can distinguish a quality scenario.

As a guy, I have never been hit by a movie like this one. I went into this movie laying next to my girlfriend, expecting to be bored out of my mind. I watched it with her, for her. I never complained, and I'm glad I didn't. This movie reminded me so much of us, and how much I don't want to lose her. I believe the acting was superb on everybody's part, with humor very well done.I never look at ratings for a movie, I read the back, or watch the trailers, and listen to ratings by trusted people I know. Never trust the ratings online or by critics, in any genre. Someone brought up the ratings on rottentomatoes, did they notice that over 95% of those ratings were from males? Now why would anybody in their right mind listen to a bunch of reviews by GUYS on a CHICK FLICK? This movie was for anybody that has the joy of being madly in love, if you are not, you won't get it.The most powerful line to me was by the character, Daniel, "I want to be somebody's Gerry" was extremely powerful to me.

One of the better romantic dramas that I've seen. P.S. I Love You has a storyline that's at the same time just outlandish and exotic enough that it keeps you invested and excited, yet it's still just within the realm of possibility so that you can reflect on how you would react in a situation like the one in the film. Plus it's a rather sweet and touching story about love, loss and sometimes being unable to move on.The thing that impressed me to most, though, was the fact that the film actually acknowledged that we usually view our lost loved ones through rose-tinted glasses. Because we actually see Gerry (Gerard Butler) and Holly (Hilary Swank) arguing before he passes away. And yet the rest of the film spends most of its time depicting Gerry as a saint. Thus it'd be so easy to call his character unrealistic and naive, if not for that arguing that turns the whole thing upside down, because in most cases it's Holly that's doing the depicting. And more often than not, we do like to remember our lost loves with fondness. So the movie nails that aspect of grieving rather perfectly. Though Gerry is still a rather amazing guy. I'd say a bit too amazing, but it's a romantic drama. It's wish-fulfillment.So the story works. Add in good characters, some interesting locations, Ireland and a rather colourful visual style and you have film that's a very nice way to spend a few hours. It's not going to challenge your view of the world or anything that extravagant, but it'll make you feel better, I guarantee. It's heart-rendering, sweet, lovable, sad and uplifting, all at the same time and it certainly has scenes that will stick with you. Especially the first meeting between Holly and Gerry. I loved that scene. And you should check it out as well.

I've felt the need to write the first movie review on my profile. If no news is good news, I have a lot of news. It started with some lame, god-awful song. The opening scene went from the characters, Holly and Gery, played by Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler (who had absolutely no chemistry at all), fighting to having sex. The second scene? Gery's funeral. What?! Oh right, a brain tumor, I guess...Because you weren't able to get to know Gery as a character, you weren't able to feel any emotion when he died. Then the whole movie focused around some letters he wrote before he died. He arranged them to be sent to Holly after he had passed. One told her to dress in a dreadful disco dress and sing some boring karaoke song at the bar all while being tone deaf. I didn't really understand the point of this.Did I mention the acting? Gag me. Remember when Sandra Bullock got an Oscar and a Razzie in the same year? Hilary Swank should have received a Razzie for this acting. Her acting in this movie was unemotional and very lacking. I'm talking about crying with a scrunched up face and no tears. Near the end when she buries her face into her mom's shoulder is when she didn't even have any tears. The comedy was a big fail. Holly and her two friends were on a boat. Their oars fell into the water and were FIVE FEET from the boat, so what did they do? Started screaming for help in the middle of the deserted lake and let the oars float away.I kept waiting for a laugh, kept waiting for something big to happen, kept waiting to be touched... Nothing. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this movie.

A film aimed squarely at a female audience, P.S. I LOVE YOU.Holly Kennedy (the handsome Hilary Swank) is a young widow who finds that her late husband (Gerard Butler) has left her a series of letters to help her start a new life. She follows the instructions in the letters and, with the help of her friends, embarks on a journey of self-discovery.Films about love and human relationships are films that I enjoy most. Sadly, I was not able to connect with this film on any satisfactory level.The film starts perfectly. The opening minutes show a dispute between Holly and her husband and this is well done, energised by hand-held, sometimes out of focus camera work. But the scene is far too drawn out and, after five minutes, starts to feel like a rough cut and becomes tiring.In fact, the whole film is too drawn out and, at times, rather clumsy. Some scenes labour to be moving, smothered in sorrowful music, which only serves to distance the audience.There's comedy in the form of Lisa Kudrow playing a supportive friend, a leprechaun singing telegram and an Asperger's suffering love interest (Harry Connick Jr.) who says exactly what he thinks without any consideration for those around him.There's a certain unfairness to the late husband's letters. While they are well-intentioned, Holly develops an unhealthy dependence on them. And the subplot involving her father's separation from her mother (Kathy Bates) feels "thrown in" and makes the film uneven.Equally poor is the use of coincidence late in the story and the final scene which involves a meeting.P.S. I LOVE YOU constantly, unashamedly, reaches for the heart - without any tact or subtlety - and fails to grasp. Unless you want it to. Unless you are willing to overlook its very contrived scenes and clumsy construction and go along for the ride, to indulge in the tissues.

PS comes from the Latin post scriptum, meaning "after writing" and came from the need to add something in a letter after the signature or foreclosure. Currently the feature is now used as a supplement or partial explanation, csual or whole. PS I Love You is based Based on the book of the Irish writer Cecelia Ahern, director Richard LaGravenese writes in partnership with Steven Rogers this adaptation, which like the pages of the book, has won millions of hearts around the world with a captivating story and dosing drama and romance.Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) is married to Gerry (Gerard Butler), an Irish funny for who is completely in love. Both live in New York, are together a long time and have yet to financial stability necessary to have a child, something he dreamed much, but it shows that it is feasible. But when Gerry dies of a brain tumor, Holly's life also ends, as she goes into a deep depression. But what she did not expect was that, imagining that this could happen, Gerry has left her several letters before she died. Each seeks to guide Holly in the way of your recovery not only of pain for your loss but also of his own rediscovery.Analyze romantic comedies is becoming a chore lately. This genre repeats every title the same predictable story and countless clichés and we can count on a movie that has something new or different approach. During life can have several love experiences, some more and some less significant, but there are few people who manage to find love, respect, affection, friendship and admiration simultaneously in another and have it all fully matched. For some, the search for someone to complete takes a lifetime and others sometimes even happens. It's not every day that two young people with a whole story to go sure those feelings. And when a terrible fate would not allow this love to continue in life, seems to be the end of the world for those who stayed. The film focuses on the Holy difficulty in dealing with the death of her husband and the feelings that surtem letters on it. Death, even being addressed, is not the main focus, but the journey of Holly in overcoming their pain.The film begins showing the chemistry between Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler, which is an essential factor to get involved in the story, with a typical discussion with a couple of text and intelligent. Swank is known for emotionally-laden dramas, winning the best actress Oscar for Boys Do not Cry (1999) and Million Dollar Baby (2004), and Butler has starred in dramas like great Dear Frankie (2004) and mostly action films like Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life (2003) and the most striking part of his career to date to air live the king Leonidas in 300 (2006). At first the two might not be the most obvious couple to bring forward the romance, but the relationship of the characters overflows empathy with the public. Within minutes of interaction between the two, we have already noted how the lovers love each other. When the next scene already shows the funeral of Gerry, and we already know how strong must be the pain for the loss of Holly.This resumption of life, Holly goes to a nightclub, singing in a karaoke, buy a lamp, makes a trip with best friends, etc.. Tips are simple but meaningful that helps. Besides the letters, Holy is his mother Patricia (Kathy Bates) who over the end will have a key role in the recovery of the child, and very close as friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon), which give a touch of humor largest plot with the peculiarities of the female universe. The three friends will cause hilarious moments with clever jokes, and also dramatic moments (such as the sequence in which Holly gets to be the maid of honor). The actresses can move from humor to the drama in just a few minutes so impressive.Holly suffers a lot in the movie. Having an actress with the ability and true to cross the dramatic arc of the character as Hilary Swank has made all the difference. Gerry, even though he died in the early scenes, is present throughout the film through flashbacks that show from when the two met in Ireland to the latest moments before his death. These flashbacks present at all times operate and serve to bring the protagonists increasingly with viewers. Kathy Bates is wonderful as Holly's mother, Patricia. At first she did not eat very sympathetic relationship between daughter and Gerry, but in the course of the plot will reveal that she has a fundamental role in the recovery of his daughter. It is one of the most complex characters.For the film to work on the issue we highlight the work of David Moritz (lizabethtown (2005)) that frequently leads from past to present without ever letting the pace drop, always being helped by the script full of tips for transitions. The versatile John Powell (X-Men 3 - The Last Stand (2007)) uses the track for the sake of romance and dramas experienced. The result is divine, knowing thrill every time. The track also contains the great "Same Mistake" by James Blunt, "" Last Train Home "by Ryan Star," P-S - I Love You "Nellie McKay," Love You 'Till The End "by The Pogues, among other. Photography and art direction by Terry Stacey is also a case apart to create some of the best scenes of bucolic and charming romance in Ireland, among other scenarios.The combination of the soundtrack, magnificent scenery, intelligent text and great actors accredit the movie to be one of the best of the genre in recent years. Even falling in some clichés, the film is hardly handler. The theme of death and emotional recovery by itself is different and that make us predisposed to greater involvement with the story. The film is certainly well above average. Indispensable for couples and for the whole family. The sincere love and true being portrayed with exquisite sensitivity. Love between man and woman, love between friends, between family, for life, and gives us great lessons of life and especially to overcome.

Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) and husband Gerry (Gerard Butler) seem to have a happy marriage. Gerry dies of a brain tumor...but it seems he has arranged to have Holly sent messages AFTER his death telling her how to get on with her life.OK--I love silly romance movies. "Sleepless in Seattle" is one of my favorites. This is VERY silly--but I didn't like it. For starters there are WAY too many love songs in it--I was getting he impression they were trying to sell a soundtrack album and could care less about the movie. Also they (stupidly) keep using clips from classic movies that had nothing to do with the plot. Seriously--WHY is Holly lip syncing to Judy Garland belting out "The Man Who Got Away"? Also the love "lessons" here are utterly predictable. It's far too long (over 2 hours), is flatly directed and badly staged. Also some really bad acting doesn't help--Kathy Bates looks blank, Lisa Kudrow is astonishingly lousy at the comic bits (that's inexcusable for someone who was on "Friends") and James Marsters is given nothing to do. Also Hilary Swank (a wonderful actress) can't do much with a horribly clichéd role. The plot rambles all over the place and there are WAY too many coincidences to believe in this.The few good points: There's a trip to Ireland and the movie makes good use of the beautiful locations there; Gina Gershon is just great in a small role; there's a nice flash of male nudity; Jeffrey Dean Morgan is just great as William (a guy Holly meets in Ireland) and Gerard Butler is fantastic. He's not in the movie too much and he overacts, but his performance is so good and he's so likable and handsome that he gives the movie a much needed jump start.Critics have savaged this. Now it's not good--but it's not a total bomb either. Butler made this movie bearable. I give it a 6.

When I saw this movie for the first time, I had just lost my husband. His death happened suddenly. I didn't have time to say goodbye.I was full of questions and couldn't find the answers. I kept asking myself WHY.And then, I read the book and watched the movie.And suddenly everything made sense.The answers to my questions were that sometimes there are things for which there's no explanation.I love this movie.I SIMPLY LOVE IT.The actors, the performances, photography, everything is just perfect.It's a movie that will help you heal.The message is of life, love.That even when your heart is crying, you can heal. That even when you are at your worst, life will prevail.Enjoy it.

Fell in love with the movie that brings you the harsh reality of life. Before watching the movie I personally didn't like the lead casts but the on screen chemistry between Swank and Butler is good. The soundtrack is cool. A special mention to 'Fairytale of New York' song played at the start (Lyrics not suitable for children). Even though the movie carried some comic scenes, it is sentimental in most parts which are lovable, in my opinion. It is difficult to see characters in Hollywood like Holly who is a loyal wife to Gerry. The conversation between the mother and the daughter at the end is my favorite part. Must appreciate the camera shots in Ireland and were good. The bottom line : many of you who read the review may not agree with my ratings but this one is heartwarming and you can watch it once with your loved ones.

In a poignant scene Gerald Butler's spirit of Gerry confesses to Hilary Swank's Holly, "I'm not asking you to remember me" and to move on. Although being a little too long, Writer and Director Richard LaGravenese's "P.S. I Love You" is a whimsical and surprisingly touching romantic comedy about life continuing forward. Swank and LaGravenese have collaborated before on "Freedom Writers" as evidenced in the movie's comfortable and sturdy feel. Hilary Swank is great in this romantic comedy, an edgy departure for the actor. Swank thrives--she never forces the humor, completely natural. She embodies a humanity and spirit in Holly that makes her vulnerable and funny in the story's context. Gerald Bulter is boldly charming as Holly's late husband Gerry, the Irishman full of life and dreams. Swank and Butler have a wondrous chemistry that smooths out the rougher edges of LaGravenese and Steve Rogers screenplay based on the novel by Wendy Finerman.Even with its over wrought indulgences, "P.S. I Love You" rewards the narrative payoff. Wisely on the part of LaGravenese and Rogers, the catharsis opts for the lyrical and realm of possibility. The performances are stellar. Academy Award Winner Kathy Bates is awesome as Holly's mother Patricia. Seeing fellow Oscar Winner Swank and Bates together is truly something special. There is a heartbreaking scene where Swank's Holly breaks down to her mother saying, "I'm alone!" Later Bates's Patrica says to her daughter, "If you're all alone, we're all together with you in that, too." So even with its intentional quirks and cheesy trappings-- all is forgiven, because ultimately "P.S. I Love You" is about the courage to love again and live life.As "P.S" opens Holly is furious that Gerry told her mother at dinner that they are not planning on having kids right now. Although accurate, Holly is still livid. Holly laments that she is waiting for her life to start. Gerry reminds, "We are in life" Transparent to us: Gerry and Holly are soul matesthe great love of each other's life. Fast forward several months, Gerry has died of a brain tumor. After the wake, Holly discovers that Gerry has arranged for the delivery of his letters all making requests of Holly. Unable or perhaps unwilling to move on after her loss, this may not be the best thing for Holly. Or is it a way for Holly to discover life anew? Much of the movie's charm derives from Holly's trip to Gerry's Irish homeland, and her loyal friends. Lisa Kudrow plays Denise, Holly's gal pal who is crassly determined to hunt down a single, straight, and employed mana crusade seemingly more difficult than it seems. Kudrow is at her scattered and hysterical best. Hot and sexy Gina Gershon plays other gal pal Sharon. Gershon is deceivingly strong and smart with the apparently vapid Sharon, who really possesses a depth of character. In a surprising moment in what initially feels like a frivolously long fishing scene with all three women, reminds Holly that her friends are moving on with their lives. Holly's trip to Ireland is a beautiful interlude that represents an eloquent return to the traditional and solid. Here LaGravenese brilliantly orchestrates his story of love everlasting and regret. Hilary Swank amazingly balances the suffering and resolute spirit in Holly. She too is brilliant and absolutely beautiful. Her smile just lights up your soul, and her anguish strikes an emotional chord. Gerald Butler is at his charismatic best. Butler also expertly tempers his charm with a touching and gentle compassion."P.S. I Love You" is one of the best romantic comedies in a long while, that has a great love story. Richard LaGravenese tells a wistful and touching tale with amazing performances and chemistry by Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler. Take a chance on "P.S. I Love You".

I loved it as I can relate to it! As the movie is an adaptation of the book, movie on the other hand has quite a different take such as the plot, ideas or even the actors.The actors have made justice to the role. Especially Kathy Bates she delivers amazing dialogues "So now,all alone or not, you gotta walk ahead. Thing to remember is if we're all alone, then we're all together in that too"

Please understand, I am commenting on the film and not the book here, the book was fantastic, funny,sad, warm really true to life, Holly had a great family, brothers and a sister who all had different tales to tell, I felt a part of this family, I loved the way they all got together at Christmas and at the barbecue.My favorite part in the book was when the younger brother filmed the girls on a night out and then won a prize!!!!!! The sad part was when Holly's elder brother was made redundant and his wife left him!!! Holly coped with all of these problems and worries as would have been expected of someone in her situation When Gerry went into the travel agents and booked the tickets for Holly and her friends was a very touching scene and I read it over and over How can the author let the film makers do this to her fantastic book how disappointed was I to see the film, there was only one thing in common with the book "Gerry died" and that was all The book was in Ireland, the film was in New York, the family was a warm and comforting one in Irealand, the film had a sister who was hardly present and the mother a sad old cow whose husband had left her NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BOOK Why do you guys buy books and then change them? If the book is a success then do the film as was the book I think that the people who never read the book will probably love the film, I think that the people who read the book and then saw the film will probably hate it Sorry to be so negative, however I am really angry at seeing a great book completely ruined Thanks for listening I feel better now

I was lucky enough to get advance screening tickets to go see this movie. I loved it! It is very funny and very romantic. It stars Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler (that gorgeous hunk of man who starred in 300, if you haven't seen it--go rent it).At the start of the movie, Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) are married and they are having a marital spat, which, trust me, is hilarious. Let's just say they end the fight with him doing a very funny striptease. In the next scene, we find that he has died. Holly is so bereaved she is unable to function but soon letters start arriving--from Gerry. He spaces the letters about a month apart and in each letter he teaches Holly how to get on with the business of living.Her ensuing adventures with best friends, Lisa Kudrow and Lisa Gershon are hilarious. Along the way, she meets Harry Connick, Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (who played Denny in Grey's Anatomy). The supporting cast is wonderful (especially the hilarious Lisa Kudrow). The movie is very funny, much more funny than sad. And Gerard Butler is quite terrific in it (and I am not just saying that because I am a fan). He is romantic, sexy, and just plain sweet. The striptease scene alone is worth the price of admission. I never laughed so hard.Hilary Swank is very, very good. She and Gerry have really great chemistry. In the scenes they have together, you totally see how much in love they are with each other and why Holly is so bereaved when he dies. Although the movie does stray from the book at times, in my opinion it's an improvement. For example, Gerard Butler is not only in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie, but he is also in it quite a bit through flashbacks and such. Plus you get to hear him sing (which he has not done in a movie since "The Phantom of the Opera").So if you get a chance this holiday season, go see this wonderful romantic, funny movie. You will love it! Amy V.

2020 edit; Everyone sucks at least a little bit in this film, but for a good cry it's always on my list. Films like this are the reason we need story--to help us process our own emotions. When my tears are locked up, this has me sobbing in 10 minutes.
*Types through thick salty tears*If you love to have your heartbroken into a million pieces, then this is the movie for you! I avoided this film for a long time because I knew the general storyline, and I wasn't okay with it. I didn't feel the need to deliberately upset myself by viewing it. But after watching this beautiful film I highly recommend it to everyone. A stellar performance from Hilary and Gerard, the chemistry they share makes you forget you're watching a film.

I typically don't write reviews of movies, but I just felt the need to warn people how awful this movie was. I like Hillary Swank but she was the complete wrong character to be cast in this movie. I just thought all of the plot lines were just way too unbelievable. I did not think Lisa Kudrow was cast well in this movie, nor was Harry Connick, Jr. Not even sure why that character was inserted into the movie. There was nothing funny or even sad about this movie. It left me emotionless. The love pursuit by Gerry was just so cheesy and non believable. I also cringed every time they did one of those cheesy flashback scenes to when Gerry was alive. I also thought seeing his friend sleep with Hillary and tell stories about Gerry when he was alive to be kind of morbid. I want two hours back of my life for watching this movie. I would not recommend this movie.
