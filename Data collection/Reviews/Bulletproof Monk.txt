Well, this starts out fairly interesting but winds up being rather silly. A hold-over from the Nazi regime looking every bit of a hundred years old has designs on an ancient Tibetan scroll which when read aloud, will give it's owner power over the world. I think we've pretty much reached the point where there won't be any more former Nazis running around, so might as well take what you can get. I like Chow Yun-Fat, so if you're a fan, it would be better to stick with "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". Here he teams up with Seann William Scott in a two-fold quest - to protect the scroll from the evil designs of Nazi Strucker (Karel Roden), and pass the mantle of guardianship to his newly discovered heir apparent, Kar (Scott). There's a running gag in the story about hot dogs and buns that doesn't make sense even when it's explained at the finale, so don't even try to understand it. The martial arts on display are pretty good, what you'd expect although the wirework is overdone a bit and looks more exaggerated than in other flicks of this type. Ultimately, 'The Next' keeper of the scroll turns out to be a team effort between Kar and sidekick Jade (Jaime King), but I wouldn't hold out for a sequel. Don't be disillusioned though, because you can always get a hot dog.

A monk at a Tibetan monastery has been protecting a mythical scroll for the last sixty years and now, in 1943, it is time for him to hand over the task to the one who has fulfilled the three prophecies. No sooner has he done this than Nazis attack and kill the old monk. His successor gets away and we next see him sixty years later as he prepares to find his successor. He bumps into a pickpocket named Kar, who takes the scroll from his bag; he sees something in the young crook though and wonders if this unlikely character will be the next guardian of the scroll. The monk has other problems too; the Nazi, now an old man, is still after the scroll which has the power to change the world into a paradise or a hell depending on the person who reads it. As the film progresses Kar shows more signs that he may be 'the one' and they have more run-ins with the Nazi and his henchmen before the inevitable final confrontation.This is definitely not a film to be taken seriously; it has plenty of flaws but is still kind of fun. There is plenty of action but much of it looks rather fake; and not in the beautifully choreographed way of films like 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'. Nazis have been a popular choice for villains ever since the war but they have been a cliché for much of that time and here it feels as though somebody watched 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and decided they wanted those villains! Chow Yun Fat does a good job as the monk; he is genuinely funny and is great in the action sequences. Seann William Scott is okay as Kar but doesn't really have the presence for the role. Jaime King, who plays Kar's love interest Jade, had more of a presence and I'd have preferred it if her character had a greater role rather than Kar. Overall this is okay if you want some mild action and don't mind all the clichés; not necessarily a film to seek out but it passes the time well enough.

Bulletproof Monk was based off a Japanese comic book(manga) and as such a American funded film vehicle for Chow Yun Fat. This movie, really is not the greatest and comes across as pretty silly overall. Chow Yun Fat is great however and is engaging and fun as the lead here as a monk from Tibet that contains the ultimate power and must protect it from Nazi's that want to utilize the scroll for their own means. Sean William Scott is'nt very good in this action driven role, but he tries and has some charisma and plays well off of Chow Yun Fat. Mako appears as well and is always good, with this being no exception. The fights choreography is not the greatest and in combination with how this story was executed, the poor f/x and otherwise lousy acting make this a pretty bad movie. Even with that said Chow Yun Fat is cool and pulls off playing this incredibly powerful and wise monk that drops many suckas as well as some knowledge and wisdom, Yoda style. The underlying positive Buddhist messages are cool and give an otherwise dumb and corny fantasy action picture a little substance. Criticisms aside, I do enjoy this film, even though overall this movie comes across as pretty idiotic for the most part.

Bulletproof Monk has a plot like it is the Indiana Jones of martial art flicks. You have a monk that is chosen every 60 years to protect a scroll that will give anyone who reads it invincible. The film revolves around The Monk with No Name (Chow) trying to find a new chosen one (Scott) while avoiding a nazi super-villain that he incountered 60 years ago.The film is more of a comedy than an action film and Sean William Scott and Chow Yun Fat play off each other well in a world where they are chased by nazis and run into characters like a British guy named Mr. Funktastic. Sean plays a goofy pickpocket well and Chow is excellent as a calm, smug, nameless monk...then again Chow has always been good at acting smug. Of course there has to be a leading lady and Jamie King is as good looking as they come and plays her character well.The action all involves wire-fu, like that as seen in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", but not as dynamic. Since most of the characters are new to martial arts the fights are a little slow but entertaining and lighthearted none the less.Bulletproof Monk could have been a lot better than it is, with a little more time spent on it, but as it is it is a silly amusing film, which kept me entertained for an hour and a half. I recommend it to martial art flick junkies.

In 1943, in Tibet, a monk (Yun-Fat Chow) renounces his name and becomes the new guardian of a powerful scroll. Meanwhile, a troop of Nazis leaded by a sick commander invades the monastery and kills the other monks, trying to steal the scroll. The monk without name spends the next sixty years protecting the scroll and looking for his successor, who shall be a person who fulfills three prophecies. In USA, he meets the lonely pickpocket Kar (Seann William Scott), and he believes that Kar may be the next protector of the scroll. Kar stays with the monk and falls in love with the beautiful Jade (Jaime King), while the monk is chased by a gang leaded by the former nazi commander and his daughter Nina. I found this film a good entertainment. There are lots of action, funny moments and in the end, it is a good action movie. The beauty of the unknown Jaime King is very impressive. I really did not understand why the scroll is not simply destroyed, since neither the guardians nor the monks use its power except for keeping the youth of the protector for sixty years. Further, the motives for the parallel life of Jade are simply ridiculous. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'O Monge à Prova de Balas' ('The Bulletproof Monk')

I'll be brief.The movie starts with a bang, and ends with a boom, with plenty of pops and kabangs along the way.You want a movie that's fun, with likable actors, good action, a light plot that moves right along, and more than a few genuine chuckles?  This is one of those.Watching Chow Yun Fat work is fun, whether he's giving life to a substantial, full orbed character such as in Crouching Tiger, or to a more stereotypical one as the Monk with No Name.Don't confuse the movies, and you'll have fun.  As for all the vitriolic, acidic critics... maybe some folks just need to take themselves just a tad less seriously.Or a few tads.

Poor old Chow Yun Fat—lured to the U.S. with the promise of an international career and big pay checks only to wind up playing second fiddle to Stifler in a trite adventure dependent on sub-par CGI and lousy wire-work. No wonder that, with the exception of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, he has worked exclusively in his homeland ever since. Hollywood really sucks sometimes!Yun-Fat plays a Tibetan monk who, during WWII, is tasked with looking after an ancient scroll able to endow the person who reads it with the power to rule the world. Because the screenwriters haven't got a single original bone in their bodies, this ancient artifact is sought after by the Nazis; sixty years later but not a day older, Yun Fat is still protecting the scroll from now aged Nazi Strucker (Karel Roden). Seann William Scott plays Kar, a pickpocket who unwittingly fulfils three ancient prophecies that mark him as the next protector of the scroll...Predictable, unimaginative nonsense from start to finish, with decidedly mediocre action scenes, Bulletproof Monk will annoy the hell out of anyone with a half decent knowledge of martial arts/Asian action cinema; Kar learning his martial arts skills by watching old kung fu movies is hard enough to accept, but I simply will not forgive director Paul Hunter for completely wasting the talents of the legendary Yun Fat.

There's absolutely nothing special about the (not so subtly-titled) 'Bulletproof Monk.' In fact, the title should tell you everything you need to know about the film. However, just because it's nothing out of the ordinary, doesn't make it a bad film. In fact... it's rather good fun (if you're not expecting too much).Sean William Scott - better known as 'Who?' unless you're watching an 'American Pie' movie, where he is - of course - 'Stiffler.' He is playing, er, 'Stiffler' basically, only he's really good at martial arts and pickpocketing people. He ends up getting caught up in a plot by Nazis seeking immortality and has to help the titular 'Bulletproof Monk' (Chow Yun Fat) save the world from these out of time creeps.This film was made back in 2003 and I'd love to say that, because of the time it was made, there was less CGI and more 'practical' effects. Yes, there are some practical effects (or should I say well-choreographed fight scenes), however a lot of the more 'fantastical' martial arts moves are all - very blatantly - filmed up against a blue screen. You may just have to forgive them for that.So, you have plucky, wise-cracking hero, wise mentor, evil baddies and obligatory love interest (Jamie King). So, like I say, nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. It's so run-of-the-mill that there's not an awful lot else I can say about it. However, just because it doesn't set the film-world alight in terms of originality, doesn't mean that it isn't enormous fun. But, if you like your modern martial arts films, or just need a relaxing little action flick to rest your brain to after a hard day's work, then this should fit the bill.

I love action movies. I love action movies with lots of martial-arts, special effects, and explosions - especially when they have cheesy dialouge that lets you sit back and enjoy the ride (anything with The Rock or Vin Diesel, for instance). But somehow, this movie just wasn't enjoyable. Sean Patrick Harris didn't add much comic relief (as I expected based on his other roles), and the storyline/characters were just way too cliché. The kung-fu-by-wire shots looked tired and derivative. And I just didn't buy Jamie King and her troop of misfits (who hang out in their "secret" subway hideout! Zoinks!)I'd go ahead and skip this one. But if you do see it, be sure to watch the alternate ending to see how awful this movie could have really been.

It was hard to watch this film and not compare some of the wild action/fight scenes with those in the Matrix or its over-hyped sequel. Whilst the scenes in BPM are not as polished or well done as those in the Matrix, they are entertaining enough and the choreography and use of props showed much more promise and imagination than those in the Wachowski Bros. productions (at least in regard to the Matrix Reloaded, anyhow).But this film did not receive the hype that TMR did and, consequently, my expectations of it were lower. As a result, I was not disappointed in BPM as I was with TMR. Sure, its all silliness, but at least it has the humour to go along with that silliness. In short, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and neiither should the audience.Chow-Yun Fat shows he can play non-serious roles and get away with it, and Sean William Scott shows he can do other parts away from American Pie and its teen comedy clones. But a particular joy to see in this film is the appearance of Mako, whom I haven't seen much of in recent years. He only has a small role in this film, but he steals the show whenever he's on screen.The kung-fu isn't quite as wild as Crouching Tiger's flying escapades nor is the wire-work quite so obvious. All in all a fun movie that should be watched as it was intended, as sheer escapism.There are a few bad points. Watch out for the villain at the end. He should get the "worst villain's hairstyle" award for his mullet. That, and the ludicrous torture machine are the lighter negative aspects in an otherwise entertaining movie, and even they somehow just add to the fun. The only really dire moment is "Mr Funktastic's" atrocious British accent/choice of language. There are some things Hollywood will NEVER get right!

20 April 2003. Bulletproof Monk, the obnoxious movie title aside, is a notch above the average martial arts movie. It brings a refreshing new breeze of comedy along with dramatic harder elements, combining both Indiana Jones genre with Lethal Weapons series. While abit thin with the comedy in the second half, Bulletproof Monk provides plenty of entertaining fun humor at the beginning and then throws in a few tidbits later on with good dramatic/comedy balance. This movie continues the more complex path towards balanced but much more difficult script-writing trying to blend comedy and drama together to more or less good effect.The Hidden Dragon special effects are abit distracting and out of sync with the rest of the movie, but overall, the martial arts action is compelling, the storyline decent, and the few twists that fit well into the movie. This male/female martial arts movie is surprisely an acceptable date movie and captures both Asian American, White, and guy/gal fantasies, the martial arts crowd, and the Karate Kid teen, growing up audience.

Bulletproof Monk is the type of movie where you know that the people involved didn't take it too seriously.  That's all well and good, but even from a light-hearted side, this movie was just too dopey to even be considered that funny.It had a few moments.  Sean William Scott had a few funny lines, and Chow Yun-Fat had some deadpan moments.  However, for a low-brow action-comedy, Bulletproof Monk still was pretty poor.  Most of the jokes didn't trigger a chuckle, the dialogue was often just plain corny, and the fighting scenes were mediocre.  I think the beautiful and breathtaking fighting sequences we saw in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon should hardly ever be mimicked, especially by a movie like this.This movie is pretty much completely dispensable.  It did keep my interest sometimes, but other than that, there's not really many redeeming qualities about Bulletproof Monk.My IMDb Rating: 4/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: C- (Disappointing)

This film was horrible! While I do use that word at times to describe certain films, this film probably is the first time that I used it to describe every part of it in its entirety. There were no redeeming qualities in this film, between the pompous acting and the cheapened story, it surprises me that anyone went to see this film or rather why it hasn't made it to the dollar bin at my local video retailer. I have read reviews that boast this film's originality and excitement, but I only mock at these fellow reviewers and question the honesty of their words. Did they see the film, or are they simply trying to build some form of publicity behind it? It is like I have said before, no matter how much you dress trash up, it is still yesterday's garbage. Bulletproof Monk is no exception. With crappy (for lack of a better word) acting, a childish story that teeters between unoriginality and boredom, and finally cheap special effects that continually prove that this director would have been better off staying with music videos instead of dabbling in the motion picture industry.You can only ask an actor to do so much before it begins to feel like yesterday's laundry. Seann William Scott is not ready to headline a film, much less an action film on his own accord. He has not handled the pressures of being a leading man nor has he earned the rights. His work on the American Pie films may have given him some pseudo-cult status, but it has not pushed him to the point of leading man. That may have been the reasoning for matching him with Yun-Fat Chow. The directors and producers were probably hoping that it would all balance out, well let me be the first to say that the scales were tipped unevenly in this movie. Scott portrayed his character physically able to do the task at hand, but with a Stifler mentality. That does not make for a good action film. There should be no reason that you, as an actor, should be clinging onto past characters to draw audiences into your film. Give them something fresh or something new to see and I promise they will continue to come back. That is definitely not the case here. Scott keeps that pompous grin on his face even during the emotional moments as if to say that he is cashing a big check with this one. In other words, from the beginning to the end of this film, he just didn't feel or fit the part that he was handed. Then again, nothing much was given by Yun-Fat Chow. Normally a decent actor, it is nearly insulting to see Chow in action with this film. CGI replaced actual fighting while deeply rooted conversation seems to float around hot dogs instead of life. It just doesn't seem like the vehicle that Chow would be found driving. Given that we have two actors that were completely miscast, the inevitable downfall for the rest of the film is that the story will suffer.This was by far the poorest written story imaginable. I was surprised that 'ole Alan Smithee didn't make an appearance on the ending credits. The use of Nazis as the irrefutable "bad guy" should sum it up for everyone reading this review. But, perhaps I am getting too hasty. The opening fight sequence was completely created by Hollywood instead of by true martial arts experts. This should be our vision into the future if we weren't so blinded by a recycled story about a scroll and the equivalent of a "golden child". The fact that our hero learns kung-fu from films is just another prize example of this downward spiral. Coupled with low-budgeted CGI and you have nothing that you can literally hold in your hands. Scott's character never gets off the ground, literally and figuratively, while Chow seems to be a substitute teacher instead of the one that gives us the wisdom we deserve. Even the love interest seems like a faded shirt. Maybe it was Scott's challenged grin or the complete lack of chemistry between him and a gu.girl named James, or just the fact that the moment they met they fell for each other without any further explanation just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt as if I had hic-ups throughout this entire film, continually wondering if they would ever settle I was forced to watch a very jumpy movie that offered no signs of relief.Finally, what would be the point of talking about this film without at least mentioning once the cheese factor of the film known as the CGI. I have several opinions on what happened in this department, of which two I plan to offer to you guys. My first impression was that Bulletproof Monk was one of the pioneer films to allow interns to create effects in hopes of bettering a film. The producers than decided to leave in all the errors and amateurish designs in hopes to show the class a final product. Then, instead of going back to change the errors, they got frustrated with their students and decided to print the copy that they had in their hand, thus ultimately ruining the film. The second option that I have considered is that the effects were done by a disgruntled employee that decided to sabotage the film by including cheapened CGI/bullet-time effects. Either way, whichever of these (or the thousands of other possibilities) happened, it hurt the film deeper than anyone could have imagined. It hurt the characters and defaced the plot, leaving nothing for the avid film viewer like myself to grasp ahold of.Overall, disappointment raged through my body when the final credits finally rolled.Grade: * out of *****

Save your money on this one. This movie is almost unwatchable. Best part is the car ride home. Avoid it like SARS. Seriously. Horrible dialogue, bad action, ridiculous cut-away fight scenes. More like Jackie Mason then Jackie Chan.

I saw this movie it first came out and continue to enjoy watching it. There is a good mixture of action and humor. Always a joy to watch!

This movie was a bit of a disappointment. The plot and the action didn't seem to have a good flow and lots of time passes where very little of anything happens. It's somewhat entertaining but I would not expect much of it.

It is pretty hard to take a film seriously when it starts with two monks sparing on a bridge and flying around. That whole karate/flying/Chinese wire trick...really...why? But "Bulletproof monk" pulls it off well. For starters, it is the first movie with an explanation of how to walk on air. But mainly the two lead roles are likable and drive the story forward all the time.The old guy from Tibet is neither Jackie Chan, nor some martial arts guru. More like a regular guy you might want as a neighbour. The young guy is a New York pick pocket, smart kid but not falling into any easy pidgeon holes either. None of those overdone slow motion stylistic shows action movies on a budget often fall for. If our hero needs to take out ten bad guys, OK, he does some fancy stuff, but he gets on with it.Plot is the normal thing. We all have to protect some ancient scroll with the secret to ultimate power. Twist is that some Nazi has been chasing it since the second World War. Yeah, we have heard that before too. But it really doesn't matter, the take is fresh. My kids watched it straight after the Spiderwick Chronicles, same story, protecting a book from evil, but they didn't mind at all.The girl in the film is interesting too. While Star Wars fans pine and groan about Rey not getting her own doll, the female lead in this film is cool, sexy, sweet, tough, able and with a nice twist at the end does real equality sort of stuff. In all, a great cast guided by an obviously good team, makes a great job of a mediocre idea.

This is one of the most appalling films I have ever seen. I wanted to switch this film off in the first 10 minutes. Don't get me wrong. I love my fantasy/action movie but this one was terrible. The effects were ridiculous. The storyline was weak. The whole emphasis on "the chosen one" was laughable. I love Chow Yun-Fat and I'm a major martial art nut but this film just made martial arts look bad. Compare this to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers and it doesn't even come close to the brilliance of these two films. John Woo...this was not one of your best pieces of work. The enemies were typical and idiotic. I was yawning all the way through. You need a film to keep you interested and wanting to find out what happens next. Films are supposed to follow a simple pattern of the following: 1) What is happening in the ordinary World 2) The Call to adventure 3) refusal of the call to adventure 4) meeting the mentor 5) getting over the first threshold and so on.... This film followed this in such a cliché way that it looked as though no effort was made into directing let alone the idea of the film. Every moment in the film was predictable and this was frustrating.

Chow Yun-Fat is the "Monk with No Name" who protects an ancient scroll. Anyone who recites the scroll can harness unlimited power, utilizing it for either good or evil. The scroll-keeper has the advantage of not aging and not being able to be physically harmed. The Monk has been on the run from would be rulers of the universe for 60 years when he finally runs into a potential new scroll-keeper as promised by prophecies.Bulletproof Monk is a "light" comic book/fantasy/action/martial arts/comedy film in the vein of The Golden Child (1986) and The Medallion (2003). It leans most strongly towards the fantasy genre, but it's frequently funny (perhaps more subtly than one would expect) and loaded with visually poetic, wire-heavy martial arts.Seann William Scott is Kar, a street kid who has a flair for kung fu, which he picked up by endlessly watching and emulating Asian films at the theater where he both lives and works as the projectionist. He has even more of a flair for pickpocketing. The Monk runs into him while both are on the run, and there are a number of cleverly staged scenes where Kar tries to palm a few extra bucks while the Monk attempts to teach him both ethics and enlightenment via koans about things like hot dogs and buns.During these early scenes, they run into a hilarious group of what are effectively CHUDs (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers) minus the C, headed by a rooster-haired thug named "Funktastic". This is some of the more slyly funny material in the film--the HUDs even have an abandoned subway car turned disco in their underground lair.The kung fu throughout most of Bulletproof Monk is of the variety often mythologized by kids as being akin to "magic". The Monk can defy gravity, move fast enough that he seems to predict his opponent's moves with near omniscience, and dodge bullets. He can even fight and eat a bowl of Cocoa Puffs at the same time. The real aim is to approach a Matrix (1999)-like reality-bending in the film's universe. Although the fantasy, almost dance-like nature of many of the fight scenes may turn off those looking for more realistic action, Troy Liddell also choreographs some parts of fight scenes more traditionally, with Yun-Fat performing something very similar to aikido--he primarily yields instead of blocking or countering, and uses his opponent's moves against themselves. It's an interesting approach that isn't used often enough in martial arts films.The principle flaw with Bulletproof Monk is that too many plot elements and characters seem to flow by too quickly. There isn't a lot of time to delve very far into many threads. This gives the film a more superficial feel that should have been solved by lengthening and tightening the focus to give elements at least a typical James Bond film significance and weight. Aspects of the film may also be a bit too clichéd for some viewers tastes.But you probably wouldn't watch Bulletproof Monk expecting a masterpiece. As a wispy fantasy/action film, geared as much towards adolescents as any other age group, Bulletproof Monk is a rewarding way to spend an hour and a half. I'm a fan of Yun-Fat's work, including this film, and I enjoyed both Scott and Jaime King's performances quite a bit. In fact, I liked the film enough to hope for a sequel.

I'll try my best to make this a brief warning for both fans of Chow Yun-Fat and films in general. Bulletproof Monk is not the film for either of you.Bulletproof Monk is movie that wants to be about martial arts coolness, and just can't pull it off. Chow Yun-Fat can be as stylish as he wants, but if the director can't film him, then his art is lost to the viewer. Paul Hunter cannot direct action, if this film is evidence. The film's most stylish scene in this "martial arts film", is a massive and likely producer John Woo inspired, Replacement Killers knock-off. I'll just say this, peaceful monk Chow Yun atop a car with dual pistols. You can figure the rest out, I would imagine. Seann William Scott and Jamie (no longer James) King quite clearly, from the way the film was shot, could not come close enough to being able to pull off their choreography to be filmed doing it. The result is the typical American pop cinema fight scene that consists of rough, jagged jump cuts that hint at action, rather than display it.On the plus side, Chow Yun-Fat is charming and likable in his role. He obviously is enjoying himself and Scott is inviting. The two have a breezy and attractive chemisty and some genuinely humerous moments together. However, some buddy karma does not a quality flick make.The film is smattered with scenes that are at once confusing and entirely unneeded for the plot of the film. And some odd production elements, as in, late in the film when, I swear to you, they forgot a sound effect. I won't say much beyond this: they're sneaking into a building and make a distraction by throwing a rock that, near as I can tell, never lands.On a final note, the villains are where the movie really falls apart. They're Nazis, okay. And that's cool. Every Indiana Jones fan loves seeing a Nazi get his- but come on, really. The villain's lair is archaic and clunky in its old comic-book styling that is totally out of place and Nina, the villainesse of the film, is a laughable caricature of a female character. No self respecting actress would accept this part, trust me. Ask any real feminist, she'll tell you. Nina's character manages to be at once needlessly and mindlessly evil, without a shred of motivation for her actions, but she is at the same time hypersexualized. Someone on this crew seems to have had issues with Mommy.Bulletproof Monk is a movie about opposing forces. Well, I'm still waiting for the stylish film yin to this disappointing clunker's yang.

Well, this starts out fairly interesting but winds up being rather silly. A hold-over from the Nazi regime looking every bit of a hundred years old has designs on an ancient Tibetan scroll which when read aloud, will give it's owner power over the world. I think we've pretty much reached the point where there won't be any more former Nazis running around, so might as well take what you can get. I like Chow Yun-Fat, so if you're a fan, it would be better to stick with "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". Here he teams up with Seann William Scott in a two-fold quest - to protect the scroll from the evil designs of Nazi Strucker (Karel Roden), and pass the mantle of guardianship to his newly discovered heir apparent, Kar (Scott). There's a running gag in the story about hot dogs and buns that doesn't make sense even when it's explained at the finale, so don't even try to understand it. The martial arts on display are pretty good, what you'd expect although the wirework is overdone a bit and looks more exaggerated than in other flicks of this type. Ultimately, 'The Next' keeper of the scroll turns out to be a team effort between Kar and sidekick Jade (Jaime King), but I wouldn't hold out for a sequel. Don't be disillusioned though, because you can always get a hot dog.

A monk at a Tibetan monastery has been protecting a mythical scroll for the last sixty years and now, in 1943, it is time for him to hand over the task to the one who has fulfilled the three prophecies. No sooner has he done this than Nazis attack and kill the old monk. His successor gets away and we next see him sixty years later as he prepares to find his successor. He bumps into a pickpocket named Kar, who takes the scroll from his bag; he sees something in the young crook though and wonders if this unlikely character will be the next guardian of the scroll. The monk has other problems too; the Nazi, now an old man, is still after the scroll which has the power to change the world into a paradise or a hell depending on the person who reads it. As the film progresses Kar shows more signs that he may be 'the one' and they have more run-ins with the Nazi and his henchmen before the inevitable final confrontation.This is definitely not a film to be taken seriously; it has plenty of flaws but is still kind of fun. There is plenty of action but much of it looks rather fake; and not in the beautifully choreographed way of films like 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'. Nazis have been a popular choice for villains ever since the war but they have been a cliché for much of that time and here it feels as though somebody watched 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and decided they wanted those villains! Chow Yun Fat does a good job as the monk; he is genuinely funny and is great in the action sequences. Seann William Scott is okay as Kar but doesn't really have the presence for the role. Jaime King, who plays Kar's love interest Jade, had more of a presence and I'd have preferred it if her character had a greater role rather than Kar. Overall this is okay if you want some mild action and don't mind all the clichés; not necessarily a film to seek out but it passes the time well enough.

Bulletproof Monk was based off a Japanese comic book(manga) and as such a American funded film vehicle for Chow Yun Fat. This movie, really is not the greatest and comes across as pretty silly overall. Chow Yun Fat is great however and is engaging and fun as the lead here as a monk from Tibet that contains the ultimate power and must protect it from Nazi's that want to utilize the scroll for their own means. Sean William Scott is'nt very good in this action driven role, but he tries and has some charisma and plays well off of Chow Yun Fat. Mako appears as well and is always good, with this being no exception. The fights choreography is not the greatest and in combination with how this story was executed, the poor f/x and otherwise lousy acting make this a pretty bad movie. Even with that said Chow Yun Fat is cool and pulls off playing this incredibly powerful and wise monk that drops many suckas as well as some knowledge and wisdom, Yoda style. The underlying positive Buddhist messages are cool and give an otherwise dumb and corny fantasy action picture a little substance. Criticisms aside, I do enjoy this film, even though overall this movie comes across as pretty idiotic for the most part.

Bulletproof Monk has a plot like it is the Indiana Jones of martial art flicks. You have a monk that is chosen every 60 years to protect a scroll that will give anyone who reads it invincible. The film revolves around The Monk with No Name (Chow) trying to find a new chosen one (Scott) while avoiding a nazi super-villain that he incountered 60 years ago.The film is more of a comedy than an action film and Sean William Scott and Chow Yun Fat play off each other well in a world where they are chased by nazis and run into characters like a British guy named Mr. Funktastic. Sean plays a goofy pickpocket well and Chow is excellent as a calm, smug, nameless monk...then again Chow has always been good at acting smug. Of course there has to be a leading lady and Jamie King is as good looking as they come and plays her character well.The action all involves wire-fu, like that as seen in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", but not as dynamic. Since most of the characters are new to martial arts the fights are a little slow but entertaining and lighthearted none the less.Bulletproof Monk could have been a lot better than it is, with a little more time spent on it, but as it is it is a silly amusing film, which kept me entertained for an hour and a half. I recommend it to martial art flick junkies.

I really wanted to like this movie. I generally enjoy Chow Yun Fat in virtually any role, I tend to enjoy martial arts films, and I am a Taoist so I at least sympathize with various forms of Buddhism. Furthermore, I believe that comic book based films are finally coming into their own as commercial cinema. However, Bulletproof Monk, though entertaining at times, never really grabbed me. I was left with the same sort of feeling I got from Tomb Raider, Aliens vs Predator, etc. Though I found Chow Yun Fat's character likable, I frequently found myself asking 'who are these people and why am I supposed to care about them?". There is a certain one-dimensionality to the characters, the script and the portrayals which can not be escaped in this film. Chow Yun Fat has been charged with the protection of a scroll which is endowed with the secret of eternal life for over 60 years. The scroll is sought by a maniacal nazi who inexplicably turns up in Tibet during World War Two and equally improbably leads a small contingent of followers in New York city in contemporary times. Chow Yun Fat, who is in NYC for an unknown reason (probably not the best place to protect an ancient scroll of incredible power and importance), playing an unnamed Tibetan monk is pursued by this militia just as he begins to befriend a protégé who he believes might be a prophesied successor in his task of protecting the scroll (Seann William Scott). An uneasy apprenticeship begins...The script is packed with martial art / Hollywood-Buddhist philosophical clichés, though I have to admit that this film does Buddhism better than many of its competitors. Most of these paradoxes and objects of meditations are unfortunately delivered in matter-of-fact disaffected tones. Similarly, the fight scenes are technically interesting, and convincingly violent, but generally devoid of any emotional content or ferocity. Compare any of these scenes to any performance by Bruce Lee, for example, and you'll see what I mean. Of course, Bruce was not really a traditional Buddhist, not a very ttraditional martial artist.The cinematography is good. I especially enjoyed seeing so many familiar sights in the world's greatest city, and some of the artistically fantastic if not entirely believable sets. It was also nice to see old friends like Mako. Unfortunately, Seann William Scott's uneven performance only reinforced the frigidity of the film.Bulletproof makes for a decent light night's entertainment, but little more. Worth seeing for martial arts and action fans.

In 1943, in Tibet, a monk (Yun-Fat Chow) renounces his name and becomes the new guardian of a powerful scroll. Meanwhile, a troop of Nazis leaded by a sick commander invades the monastery and kills the other monks, trying to steal the scroll. The monk without name spends the next sixty years protecting the scroll and looking for his successor, who shall be a person who fulfills three prophecies. In USA, he meets the lonely pickpocket Kar (Seann William Scott), and he believes that Kar may be the next protector of the scroll. Kar stays with the monk and falls in love with the beautiful Jade (Jaime King), while the monk is chased by a gang leaded by the former nazi commander and his daughter Nina. I found this film a good entertainment. There are lots of action, funny moments and in the end, it is a good action movie. The beauty of the unknown Jaime King is very impressive. I really did not understand why the scroll is not simply destroyed, since neither the guardians nor the monks use its power except for keeping the youth of the protector for sixty years. Further, the motives for the parallel life of Jade are simply ridiculous. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'O Monge à Prova de Balas' ('The Bulletproof Monk')

I must, first of all, point out that this movie is very good fun and must not, in any way be taken at all seriously. I loved the concept of the story but felt that things were very much spoilt by the overblown, overcontrived action scenes. This was the case from the very first minute. As for the acting......well this turned out to be very much a case of goodies v baddies. Seann William Scott, Chow Yun-Fat and Jaime King (the good guys) all turn in sterling performances. In fact, it looks as if Seann William Scott & Chow Yun-Fat had immense fun making this film and their chemistry is there to see. As for the bad guys.......Karel Rodin, Victoria Smurfit and Marcus Jean Pirae. Well, what can I say? I felt that they were all terrible and all over the top. I was particularly disappointed with Victoria Smurfit, who I had seen many times before and knew her to be a very talented actress. I think that the problem with her character was basically because she had a very over emphasised British accent. Smurfit is Irish, so why the hell didn't they just maintain her natural accent. Worse though, was Marcus Jean Pirae as the underground gang boss. He has no excuse though. His too was an over emphasised British accent.......but actually IS English I believe. As I say, the film was great fun and it was made watchable by the fact that the good (acting) outweighed the bad (acting). It was, by no means, a complete turn off.

I'll be brief.The movie starts with a bang, and ends with a boom, with plenty of pops and kabangs along the way.You want a movie that's fun, with likable actors, good action, a light plot that moves right along, and more than a few genuine chuckles?  This is one of those.Watching Chow Yun Fat work is fun, whether he's giving life to a substantial, full orbed character such as in Crouching Tiger, or to a more stereotypical one as the Monk with No Name.Don't confuse the movies, and you'll have fun.  As for all the vitriolic, acidic critics... maybe some folks just need to take themselves just a tad less seriously.Or a few tads.

Poor old Chow Yun Fat—lured to the U.S. with the promise of an international career and big pay checks only to wind up playing second fiddle to Stifler in a trite adventure dependent on sub-par CGI and lousy wire-work. No wonder that, with the exception of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, he has worked exclusively in his homeland ever since. Hollywood really sucks sometimes!Yun-Fat plays a Tibetan monk who, during WWII, is tasked with looking after an ancient scroll able to endow the person who reads it with the power to rule the world. Because the screenwriters haven't got a single original bone in their bodies, this ancient artifact is sought after by the Nazis; sixty years later but not a day older, Yun Fat is still protecting the scroll from now aged Nazi Strucker (Karel Roden). Seann William Scott plays Kar, a pickpocket who unwittingly fulfils three ancient prophecies that mark him as the next protector of the scroll...Predictable, unimaginative nonsense from start to finish, with decidedly mediocre action scenes, Bulletproof Monk will annoy the hell out of anyone with a half decent knowledge of martial arts/Asian action cinema; Kar learning his martial arts skills by watching old kung fu movies is hard enough to accept, but I simply will not forgive director Paul Hunter for completely wasting the talents of the legendary Yun Fat.

There's absolutely nothing special about the (not so subtly-titled) 'Bulletproof Monk.' In fact, the title should tell you everything you need to know about the film. However, just because it's nothing out of the ordinary, doesn't make it a bad film. In fact... it's rather good fun (if you're not expecting too much).Sean William Scott - better known as 'Who?' unless you're watching an 'American Pie' movie, where he is - of course - 'Stiffler.' He is playing, er, 'Stiffler' basically, only he's really good at martial arts and pickpocketing people. He ends up getting caught up in a plot by Nazis seeking immortality and has to help the titular 'Bulletproof Monk' (Chow Yun Fat) save the world from these out of time creeps.This film was made back in 2003 and I'd love to say that, because of the time it was made, there was less CGI and more 'practical' effects. Yes, there are some practical effects (or should I say well-choreographed fight scenes), however a lot of the more 'fantastical' martial arts moves are all - very blatantly - filmed up against a blue screen. You may just have to forgive them for that.So, you have plucky, wise-cracking hero, wise mentor, evil baddies and obligatory love interest (Jamie King). So, like I say, nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. It's so run-of-the-mill that there's not an awful lot else I can say about it. However, just because it doesn't set the film-world alight in terms of originality, doesn't mean that it isn't enormous fun. But, if you like your modern martial arts films, or just need a relaxing little action flick to rest your brain to after a hard day's work, then this should fit the bill.

I love action movies. I love action movies with lots of martial-arts, special effects, and explosions - especially when they have cheesy dialouge that lets you sit back and enjoy the ride (anything with The Rock or Vin Diesel, for instance). But somehow, this movie just wasn't enjoyable. Sean Patrick Harris didn't add much comic relief (as I expected based on his other roles), and the storyline/characters were just way too cliché. The kung-fu-by-wire shots looked tired and derivative. And I just didn't buy Jamie King and her troop of misfits (who hang out in their "secret" subway hideout! Zoinks!)I'd go ahead and skip this one. But if you do see it, be sure to watch the alternate ending to see how awful this movie could have really been.

It was hard to watch this film and not compare some of the wild action/fight scenes with those in the Matrix or its over-hyped sequel. Whilst the scenes in BPM are not as polished or well done as those in the Matrix, they are entertaining enough and the choreography and use of props showed much more promise and imagination than those in the Wachowski Bros. productions (at least in regard to the Matrix Reloaded, anyhow).But this film did not receive the hype that TMR did and, consequently, my expectations of it were lower. As a result, I was not disappointed in BPM as I was with TMR. Sure, its all silliness, but at least it has the humour to go along with that silliness. In short, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and neiither should the audience.Chow-Yun Fat shows he can play non-serious roles and get away with it, and Sean William Scott shows he can do other parts away from American Pie and its teen comedy clones. But a particular joy to see in this film is the appearance of Mako, whom I haven't seen much of in recent years. He only has a small role in this film, but he steals the show whenever he's on screen.The kung-fu isn't quite as wild as Crouching Tiger's flying escapades nor is the wire-work quite so obvious. All in all a fun movie that should be watched as it was intended, as sheer escapism.There are a few bad points. Watch out for the villain at the end. He should get the "worst villain's hairstyle" award for his mullet. That, and the ludicrous torture machine are the lighter negative aspects in an otherwise entertaining movie, and even they somehow just add to the fun. The only really dire moment is "Mr Funktastic's" atrocious British accent/choice of language. There are some things Hollywood will NEVER get right!

20 April 2003. Bulletproof Monk, the obnoxious movie title aside, is a notch above the average martial arts movie. It brings a refreshing new breeze of comedy along with dramatic harder elements, combining both Indiana Jones genre with Lethal Weapons series. While abit thin with the comedy in the second half, Bulletproof Monk provides plenty of entertaining fun humor at the beginning and then throws in a few tidbits later on with good dramatic/comedy balance. This movie continues the more complex path towards balanced but much more difficult script-writing trying to blend comedy and drama together to more or less good effect.The Hidden Dragon special effects are abit distracting and out of sync with the rest of the movie, but overall, the martial arts action is compelling, the storyline decent, and the few twists that fit well into the movie. This male/female martial arts movie is surprisely an acceptable date movie and captures both Asian American, White, and guy/gal fantasies, the martial arts crowd, and the Karate Kid teen, growing up audience.

Bulletproof Monk is the type of movie where you know that the people involved didn't take it too seriously.  That's all well and good, but even from a light-hearted side, this movie was just too dopey to even be considered that funny.It had a few moments.  Sean William Scott had a few funny lines, and Chow Yun-Fat had some deadpan moments.  However, for a low-brow action-comedy, Bulletproof Monk still was pretty poor.  Most of the jokes didn't trigger a chuckle, the dialogue was often just plain corny, and the fighting scenes were mediocre.  I think the beautiful and breathtaking fighting sequences we saw in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon should hardly ever be mimicked, especially by a movie like this.This movie is pretty much completely dispensable.  It did keep my interest sometimes, but other than that, there's not really many redeeming qualities about Bulletproof Monk.My IMDb Rating: 4/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: C- (Disappointing)

I thought it was charming. I thought it was fun. I enjoyed it a great deal. I liked the characters a lot too (especially the Monk). Now I'm looking for other movies starring Yun-Fat Chow.I must admit that I did find the underground cavern and the mysterious mind-reading device to be rather over-the-top, but that was the only part of the movie I didn't like.Please keep in mind that this movie _is_ based on a comic book. It's not meant to be Important, World-changing theatre. It's meant to be a fast-paced (it is), interesting (I thought so), fun-to-watch (yes) story.

Save your money on this one. This movie is almost unwatchable. Best part is the car ride home. Avoid it like SARS. Seriously. Horrible dialogue, bad action, ridiculous cut-away fight scenes. More like Jackie Mason then Jackie Chan.

I saw this movie it first came out and continue to enjoy watching it. There is a good mixture of action and humor. Always a joy to watch!

This film was horrible! While I do use that word at times to describe certain films, this film probably is the first time that I used it to describe every part of it in its entirety. There were no redeeming qualities in this film, between the pompous acting and the cheapened story, it surprises me that anyone went to see this film or rather why it hasn't made it to the dollar bin at my local video retailer. I have read reviews that boast this film's originality and excitement, but I only mock at these fellow reviewers and question the honesty of their words. Did they see the film, or are they simply trying to build some form of publicity behind it? It is like I have said before, no matter how much you dress trash up, it is still yesterday's garbage. Bulletproof Monk is no exception. With crappy (for lack of a better word) acting, a childish story that teeters between unoriginality and boredom, and finally cheap special effects that continually prove that this director would have been better off staying with music videos instead of dabbling in the motion picture industry.You can only ask an actor to do so much before it begins to feel like yesterday's laundry. Seann William Scott is not ready to headline a film, much less an action film on his own accord. He has not handled the pressures of being a leading man nor has he earned the rights. His work on the American Pie films may have given him some pseudo-cult status, but it has not pushed him to the point of leading man. That may have been the reasoning for matching him with Yun-Fat Chow. The directors and producers were probably hoping that it would all balance out, well let me be the first to say that the scales were tipped unevenly in this movie. Scott portrayed his character physically able to do the task at hand, but with a Stifler mentality. That does not make for a good action film. There should be no reason that you, as an actor, should be clinging onto past characters to draw audiences into your film. Give them something fresh or something new to see and I promise they will continue to come back. That is definitely not the case here. Scott keeps that pompous grin on his face even during the emotional moments as if to say that he is cashing a big check with this one. In other words, from the beginning to the end of this film, he just didn't feel or fit the part that he was handed. Then again, nothing much was given by Yun-Fat Chow. Normally a decent actor, it is nearly insulting to see Chow in action with this film. CGI replaced actual fighting while deeply rooted conversation seems to float around hot dogs instead of life. It just doesn't seem like the vehicle that Chow would be found driving. Given that we have two actors that were completely miscast, the inevitable downfall for the rest of the film is that the story will suffer.This was by far the poorest written story imaginable. I was surprised that 'ole Alan Smithee didn't make an appearance on the ending credits. The use of Nazis as the irrefutable "bad guy" should sum it up for everyone reading this review. But, perhaps I am getting too hasty. The opening fight sequence was completely created by Hollywood instead of by true martial arts experts. This should be our vision into the future if we weren't so blinded by a recycled story about a scroll and the equivalent of a "golden child". The fact that our hero learns kung-fu from films is just another prize example of this downward spiral. Coupled with low-budgeted CGI and you have nothing that you can literally hold in your hands. Scott's character never gets off the ground, literally and figuratively, while Chow seems to be a substitute teacher instead of the one that gives us the wisdom we deserve. Even the love interest seems like a faded shirt. Maybe it was Scott's challenged grin or the complete lack of chemistry between him and a gu.girl named James, or just the fact that the moment they met they fell for each other without any further explanation just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt as if I had hic-ups throughout this entire film, continually wondering if they would ever settle I was forced to watch a very jumpy movie that offered no signs of relief.Finally, what would be the point of talking about this film without at least mentioning once the cheese factor of the film known as the CGI. I have several opinions on what happened in this department, of which two I plan to offer to you guys. My first impression was that Bulletproof Monk was one of the pioneer films to allow interns to create effects in hopes of bettering a film. The producers than decided to leave in all the errors and amateurish designs in hopes to show the class a final product. Then, instead of going back to change the errors, they got frustrated with their students and decided to print the copy that they had in their hand, thus ultimately ruining the film. The second option that I have considered is that the effects were done by a disgruntled employee that decided to sabotage the film by including cheapened CGI/bullet-time effects. Either way, whichever of these (or the thousands of other possibilities) happened, it hurt the film deeper than anyone could have imagined. It hurt the characters and defaced the plot, leaving nothing for the avid film viewer like myself to grasp ahold of.Overall, disappointment raged through my body when the final credits finally rolled.Grade: * out of *****

This movie was a bit of a disappointment. The plot and the action didn't seem to have a good flow and lots of time passes where very little of anything happens. It's somewhat entertaining but I would not expect much of it.

It is pretty hard to take a film seriously when it starts with two monks sparing on a bridge and flying around. That whole karate/flying/Chinese wire trick...really...why? But "Bulletproof monk" pulls it off well. For starters, it is the first movie with an explanation of how to walk on air. But mainly the two lead roles are likable and drive the story forward all the time.The old guy from Tibet is neither Jackie Chan, nor some martial arts guru. More like a regular guy you might want as a neighbour. The young guy is a New York pick pocket, smart kid but not falling into any easy pidgeon holes either. None of those overdone slow motion stylistic shows action movies on a budget often fall for. If our hero needs to take out ten bad guys, OK, he does some fancy stuff, but he gets on with it.Plot is the normal thing. We all have to protect some ancient scroll with the secret to ultimate power. Twist is that some Nazi has been chasing it since the second World War. Yeah, we have heard that before too. But it really doesn't matter, the take is fresh. My kids watched it straight after the Spiderwick Chronicles, same story, protecting a book from evil, but they didn't mind at all.The girl in the film is interesting too. While Star Wars fans pine and groan about Rey not getting her own doll, the female lead in this film is cool, sexy, sweet, tough, able and with a nice twist at the end does real equality sort of stuff. In all, a great cast guided by an obviously good team, makes a great job of a mediocre idea.

This is one of the most appalling films I have ever seen. I wanted to switch this film off in the first 10 minutes. Don't get me wrong. I love my fantasy/action movie but this one was terrible. The effects were ridiculous. The storyline was weak. The whole emphasis on "the chosen one" was laughable. I love Chow Yun-Fat and I'm a major martial art nut but this film just made martial arts look bad. Compare this to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers and it doesn't even come close to the brilliance of these two films. John Woo...this was not one of your best pieces of work. The enemies were typical and idiotic. I was yawning all the way through. You need a film to keep you interested and wanting to find out what happens next. Films are supposed to follow a simple pattern of the following: 1) What is happening in the ordinary World 2) The Call to adventure 3) refusal of the call to adventure 4) meeting the mentor 5) getting over the first threshold and so on.... This film followed this in such a cliché way that it looked as though no effort was made into directing let alone the idea of the film. Every moment in the film was predictable and this was frustrating.

Chow Yun-Fat is the "Monk with No Name" who protects an ancient scroll. Anyone who recites the scroll can harness unlimited power, utilizing it for either good or evil. The scroll-keeper has the advantage of not aging and not being able to be physically harmed. The Monk has been on the run from would be rulers of the universe for 60 years when he finally runs into a potential new scroll-keeper as promised by prophecies.Bulletproof Monk is a "light" comic book/fantasy/action/martial arts/comedy film in the vein of The Golden Child (1986) and The Medallion (2003). It leans most strongly towards the fantasy genre, but it's frequently funny (perhaps more subtly than one would expect) and loaded with visually poetic, wire-heavy martial arts.Seann William Scott is Kar, a street kid who has a flair for kung fu, which he picked up by endlessly watching and emulating Asian films at the theater where he both lives and works as the projectionist. He has even more of a flair for pickpocketing. The Monk runs into him while both are on the run, and there are a number of cleverly staged scenes where Kar tries to palm a few extra bucks while the Monk attempts to teach him both ethics and enlightenment via koans about things like hot dogs and buns.During these early scenes, they run into a hilarious group of what are effectively CHUDs (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers) minus the C, headed by a rooster-haired thug named "Funktastic". This is some of the more slyly funny material in the film--the HUDs even have an abandoned subway car turned disco in their underground lair.The kung fu throughout most of Bulletproof Monk is of the variety often mythologized by kids as being akin to "magic". The Monk can defy gravity, move fast enough that he seems to predict his opponent's moves with near omniscience, and dodge bullets. He can even fight and eat a bowl of Cocoa Puffs at the same time. The real aim is to approach a Matrix (1999)-like reality-bending in the film's universe. Although the fantasy, almost dance-like nature of many of the fight scenes may turn off those looking for more realistic action, Troy Liddell also choreographs some parts of fight scenes more traditionally, with Yun-Fat performing something very similar to aikido--he primarily yields instead of blocking or countering, and uses his opponent's moves against themselves. It's an interesting approach that isn't used often enough in martial arts films.The principle flaw with Bulletproof Monk is that too many plot elements and characters seem to flow by too quickly. There isn't a lot of time to delve very far into many threads. This gives the film a more superficial feel that should have been solved by lengthening and tightening the focus to give elements at least a typical James Bond film significance and weight. Aspects of the film may also be a bit too clichéd for some viewers tastes.But you probably wouldn't watch Bulletproof Monk expecting a masterpiece. As a wispy fantasy/action film, geared as much towards adolescents as any other age group, Bulletproof Monk is a rewarding way to spend an hour and a half. I'm a fan of Yun-Fat's work, including this film, and I enjoyed both Scott and Jaime King's performances quite a bit. In fact, I liked the film enough to hope for a sequel.

For a clichéd piece of fluff, because that's clearly what BULLETPROOF MONK is, it's a far better film than you might imagine. Much of that likability rests on whether you like or loathe Seann William Scott, the actor best known for his goofy roles like Stifler in the American PIE films. I have to say, I love his acting and I find him a very funny person, probably the only person in Hollywood today who can bring a smile to my face. So much of my entertainment in this film came from his appearance, playing a thief turned hero.Elsewhere, this is the kind of bogus mystical flick that gets churned out regularly by studios. It's very similar to THE MEDALLION, with Jackie Chan, which came out in the same year, and I enjoyed it equally as much as that movie. One thing you have to remember is that these are lightly plotted bits of nonsense, heavily clichéd throughout and displaying the kind of wirework I usually loathe. BULLETPROOF MONK is a silly film, sometimes completely stupid – like the villain's lair, for instance – but it's hard to dislike as a buddy-buddy type comedy.Chow Yun-Fat is the straight man, used to doing this kind of noble hero stuff in his sleep, and the film just kind of takes place around him. Scott supplies the comedy, I'm not sure what Jaime King is around for other than to look very pretty, and Karel Roden is a Nazi villain who seems to have come straight out of HELLBOY. There are some other amusing bit parts, like the appearance of Mako in one of his last roles, plus British television actress Victoria Smurfit playing another villain with a stiff-upper-lip accent.The action isn't great, but it has a nicely violent edge for what is essentially a kid's film. I didn't care for the wirework, but the straightforward fighting scenes are good. They rip off Jackie Chan films pretty heavily for the style, choreography and reliance on props, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Special effects are decent and the film has a good pace. While the dialogue isn't entirely credible and some of the minor characters/situations completely laughable, and not in a good way, for the most part BULLETPROOF MONK is amiable tosh and a film I got a lot of enjoyment from.

If this movie could be summed up in one word it's "potential". Ironicly that's also one of the more overused words in the movie. Fat has the speed and acting talent to keep this from totally sinking but that's not saying much. And Williams-Scott looks so lost in all of this. They are both talented enough that they it could have worked. The problem: incompetent directing and writing. Nazi's & cliche's abound, save your money for next weeks movies.
