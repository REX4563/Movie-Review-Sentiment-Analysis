This film isn't fantastic, but it is far from dismal as many people here have made it out to be.Sure, the premise of the movie is silly, but most of these types of comedy movies are. The film is entertaining and Martin Lawrence shows his comedic talent again.If you think this film deserves one or two stars, you probably haven't seen enough movies. For a true 1-star film, go see "Going Overboard" with Adam Sandler---I bet you won't be able to watch it until the end.Black Knight is a pretty good film and I recommend you see it if you get the chance.

I actually paid $4.20 to watch this movie, and the only funny things were a few cute lines and that was it. Martin Lawrence tried his best, but he's made far better movies. And the time. This movie hardly lasted 90 minutes (which is actually a fortunate thing). Usually, movies that short have poor plots and little humor. This movie is no exception.The idea is so silly. Jamal falls into a pond, trying to retrieve a necklace, and he appears in 14th century England? That sounds like a day dream to me. I guess it doesn't matter to Lawrence, who only wants to degrade people and show how much better he is than others.Kevin

This is overall a good movie. If you like Martin lawrence you will like this movie. Maybe it was ahead of its time? I watched this movie as a kid and loved it. Still love it as a 30 year old. The premise is silly, so expect a silly movie. That's what trailers are for. C comedy movie about A dude from the 2000's who goes back in time to midevil times.... you get what you watch.

If there's one type of film that simultaneously bores and infuriates, it is this "one trick pony" type where the entire script is the same joke over and over and over and over and over. I don't care what the trailers and the "making-of" said about the meticulous historical research that went into the medieval settings and costumes (balderdash), it still sucked. I hope that Martin Lawrence will find his true vocation soon. He does not act. He has failed to even make me chuckle once. Of course, I'm a Dennis Miller guy...I could be wrong. Note: Unbelievably, IMDb recommends "Braveheart" too if you liked "The Black Knight"! Well, so much for the accuracy of IMDb's "Also Recommends..."

A perfect example of all the bad things people tend to think about Americans. Uncultured, boorish, unsophisticated, the list goes on.There was much gnashing of teeth while sitting through this movie.

I don't think that this film was even one tenth as bad as many of the reviews I've seen. First, it should be taken in the spirit of which is was obviously made, fun, light comedy. Certainly, it didn't break any "new ground," and I doubt that it will be remembered along with "Some Like It Hot." As much as I initially wanted to HATE this film, I thought it was a noble effort by the star, who was wise enough to surround himself with supremely talented British actors (many from the legitimate stage) who both accurately embodied the realism of the time, and possessed the chops to pull it off. Yes, it used all of the typical ghetto dialogue and Hollywood plots, but it did it with such clever wit and attitude that I wound up being quite charmed by the film. Again, if you're looking for "Malcolm X," don't bother. But for an afternoon's amusement, good, clean fun. I have no qualms about saying that I enjoyed it.

Martin Lawrence didnt do that bad of a job on fliming this movie, it was just the idea and concept of the movie itself, it was predictable, very very un funny, and just stupid, no one thats innocent should have to sit through that movie.

I never once laughed in this incredibly stupid movie. Martin Lawrence was not funny at all, and the movie could easily have been the worst medieval drama ever. I saw the trailer, and I thought that the movie would be good, but the only chuckle you ever get is from one or two lines the first time you watch the trailer.

A cool mix of historic times with a perfect amount of Martin Lawerence losing his mind with glorious humor! I've enjoyed Black knight even when I was younger, slapstick delight that isn't for everyone. Almost as if David Benioff collaborated with Gil Junger and decided to goof around, I love it! The music is great fun too.

I think martin's funny. His TV show was great, Bad Boys was pretty good and Blue Streak is the best movie he's done so far......But since Blue Streak it's been crappy movie after crappy movie. First the corny piece of crap big momma's house, then what's the worst that can happen and now the worst of the three: The Black Knight.Didn't laugh once. Stupid can be funny, but this just wasn't funny. The jokes have all been done. it's embarrassing.Martin, what the hell happened?? Blue Streak 2 can't come soon enough for this guy.

If you want a film with a history lesson, hook into national geographic channel. If, however, you have 90 odd minutes to spare, have a good old fashioned belly laugh or ten with this. Corny jokes? tick. visual humor? tick. couple of eurrgh moments? tick. Try and be in a mellow mood before you view, and you won't regret spending time with this one. Also, a nifty soundtrack, though not all over the film, and some great (although there is a bit of a theme) olde worlde talking gags. There's some great looking maidens in it as well. Considering it was made in 2001, it has aged quite well, but some sports references could leave you scratching your head. I loved it, and seeing as it didn't hurt anyone else, i don't care who knows it! There was a ready made set up for a sequel, but as far as i know, it never happened. If anyone knows different, please let me know, as i wouldn't hesitate to watch it!

To be completely honest I am not a fan of Martin Lawrence, although I LOVED "Bad Boys" and thought he did an awesome job in that film...but this review isn't about THAT film ("Blue Streak" was pretty good too).  Anyhow, I have to say that I had EXTREMELY low expectations for "Black Knight", the previews were barely funny, the story looked god-awful, and just over-all nothing even remotely great.  ...BUT...I watched the movie anyway.  I thought the movie was just HORRIBLE, but there were a few things that I thought were pretty funny.I really can't believe that a movie like this would get green-lit.  I can't believe that someone would read this story and say "Yeah, let's make this into a movie!"  You gotta be kidding me?!?!I really don't have much else to say about the film.  If you are a fan of Martin Lawrence, then there's a possibility that you may like the film.  If you've got some free time, and have an opportunity to see it for free (or really cheap) go ahead and check it out.  Otherwise, spend your money on a different movie.Thanks for reading,-Chris

I have to admit I've never seen a movie quite like "Black Knight" before, and of course, I mean that in a bad way. I've never seen a movie quite so unfunny.The only movie I've seen Martin Lawrence in that I actually enjoyed somewhat would have to be "Blue Streak," and even that wasn't a great movie. "Big Momma's House" was another disastrous effort, along with "Black Knight" and "What's the Worst That Could Happen?" As you've probably guessed, I'm not a big Lawrence fan.Black cinema hasn't lived up to high standards in the past few years. While "Boyz N the Hood" is one of my favorite movies, this movie is one of the films released recently (same with "How High," "Bones," "The Wash") that just happens to be entertainment aimed mainly at African Americans.I won't even bother reworking the plot because it pretty much stinks. It's a rip-off of Mark Twain's classic "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" that's neither funny nor innovative.How the studio that produced this garbage even thought of making it is beyond me because "Black Knight" shouldn't have seen the light of day.

This movie has got to be one of the worst for Martin Lawrence. There were laughs here and there, but the plot of the movie was just stupid. And how many times have you seen when there was a person you saw before in the past and then saw a future one. Well anyways. This was a waste of my money. Not to mention that the theatre I went to totally sucked! It just made the movie even worst! But anyways maybe if I watched the movie again I "might" enjoy it.

A ridiculous and insulting movie to the Old English History!At first i found it funny, but then it only Got Worse!Marsha Thomason's talent is wasted on this Movie. Thomason's "inability" to "adapt" to her "role", is shown throughout the movie when she "seems" totally "uncomfortable" with her role.Martin Lawrence for his standard, was overall ridiculously awful, Old moves and Old Jokes.And not even good "Old Jokes"!And "The Ali Schuffle" wasn't made Anymore special in some of the, "Fightscene's". His performance was Joke, and the Hole Movie was a Joke.I really Felt sorry for Marsha Thomason ho had her Talent wasted.In my eyes Laurence learned a big lesson : "Do not bring America in to British History!Because if you do, the jokes must be a lot better!The Plot seemed alright but the movie failed Big Time!I think Lawrence must Find "New Idea's" Or at least "Funny Old Jokes".This Movie overall was a Shambolic "Joke"!Because this was an awful movie that i wouldn't recommend anyone to see!My Score : 1.0Groeten Gerrit

The star of one of the most successful African American sitcoms of the 90s returns for yet another uninspired comedy charged with more racial jokes than you can shake a stick at.Medieval feudalism meets hip-hop. Another typical "culture clash" comedy, with all the tools to look exactly the same as its predecessors ("Rush Hour," "Bringing Down the House"), but doesn't come across quite as funny.The one thing I can say for this movie is that it definitely doesn't take itself seriously. The reactions and mannerisms of the medieval people are stretched at best, and Lawrence's reactions aren't quite how you'd expect a normal person to act, were he thrown back in time. All of the jokes are clearly set up, but the ridiculousness of the movie might just grow on you after a while if you treat it like a bad movie.The front half of the movie is completely abysmal. It's just about clichés of black culture and nothing more. The second half mellows a lot on the racial humor and becomes more charming. It doesn't become "good," but it had charm. Without giving anything away, there's a contrived dance scene that arises well into the movie. As silly and ridiculous as it is, it's an entertaining and well-done scene.I still gave this movie a two, because even though I enjoyed some scenes near the end, I wouldn't be much of a movie critic if I gave this movie TOO much due. It really is just a bad movie. The fairly original concept was enough to hold my interest, although the comedy was cliché most of the time and overall poorly executed.Worth watching if you're in the mood for seeing something stupid but not boring. If you want a laugh-out-loud masterpiece, look elsewhere.

This movie was tolerable at best. Not bad considering the circumstances behind Martin Lawrence traveling back in time. That was a little unimaginative. This one makes A Knight's Tale seem like a medieval masterpiece. (3 out of 10)

I'm no particular fan of Martin Lawrence, but I've just seen Blue Streak and Black Knight, and they were both quite a bit better than I'd expected. While not enormously funny, they were still pretty entertaining, and more importantly, generally tasteful. Far, *far* superior to horrid crap like Scary Movie (and esp. the horrendous sequels), American Pie or anything with Leslie Nielsen in it.I must voice some concern about this movie (Black Knight) getting *600* "1" ratings. That's absolutely unfair. Without having any kind of interest in Lawrence's career, I still have to say that it smacks of a legion of less than level-headed Lawrence-haters having given the movie a "1" rating just to give it a bad rap (and possibly without actually having seen it). It's quite simply the only explanation. No way that many people could honestly say this movie deserves a "1" out of 10.My rating: 6 out of 10.

Finally got around to seeing this one on D-TV.I believe most know the plot:  man from South-Central LA is teleported to the days of Knights and becomes involved in a rebellion to oust the evil King and restore the good Queen.In general, it was disappointing because the screenplay did not allow Martin Lawrence to be as funny as he normally is.  It seemed forced and weighted down.  Unlike other Lawrence films (i.e. Bad Boys, Blue Streak, Big Mama's House) we were not able to see the Martin that we all know and love (or hate).  Instead of the impulsive, quick-witted Martin we expect, what we actually saw was Martin that struggled with a poor, predictable script that runs out of fuel in the first twenty minutes and leaves Martin to try to make something out of the remaining hour.  As funny as he can be, he is no miracle worker.All in all I give it a mediocre to low rating.  The worst thing is that when I see that Martin Lawrence is going to be in a film I expect certain level of funniness from him.  I was disappointed.  I feel gypped out of one hour-twenty-minutes of my Saturday.

With Martin Lawrence you can't expect too much, even when he's teamed up with Will Smith. Lawrence's Black Knight shows that the man has talent but it also shows off some of the weaknesses in his comical approach. Basically I have low expectations for almost any film concerning time-travel (except for Time Bandits) but to a degree the film actually produced some rather believable scenarios (considering the stupidity of the over-all concept).The problem is that the film is composed with the classic over-the-top zaniness as being the main priority. Had this been a crazy-comedy it would have worked, but as is, it's rather half-hearted. Particularly the final battle was nowhere as convincing as I would have hoped.The film has a bit of a conflict in deciding if it is supposed to be aimed at kids or adults. Is it supposed to be crazy or real. Because it falls to the middle it doesn't deliver as well.On a positive note, the stunts were rather fine, costumes were good and the ending was also pretty fun.

Sure, the whole idea behind the premise of the film--transporting a black man from the present to England during medieval times---sounds great on paper, with guaranteed laughs throughout...right? Wrong! This film did not elicit a single laugh--not even a chuckle--from me. What a waste of celluloid. Just watch this nincompoop, Martin Lawrence, embarrass himself throughout the film with a one-note expression on his face--i.e., the look of sardonic, bewilderment--and acting that's meant to be comical, but looks...well, forced and desperate.Probably one of the worst films I've seen in recent memory.

This movie is so funny. "White man down" joke is a little racy, but I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Loosen up everybody, and enjoy. Although, in the beginning he was driving a mustang, and I thought there was going to be some dialog about it. Something about how he rides a mustang... I thought the jokes were hilarious. I think the marketing of this movie needed work, the movie would have done better. It didn't represent the naive element and the fun around it. I honestly don't think there's one bad scene in that movie. I think Martin was the only one for this movie, I can't see anyone else, and the actress was an excellent pick also. This is a great movie and I highly recommend it to everyone.

This is a 7? This movie is a 7?Yes. Yes, it is.Maybe it's because in the 2020's we are in a comedic desert landscape.Maybe time brings certain undeniable truths to the surface, though this truth I have always known and held close.Martin Lawrence is a comedy genius.A generational talent and icon.Even with material as thin and silly as this, he shines.And he has help along the way with likely and unlikely pairings.This movie isn't trying to be anything it's not. It is exactly what it is trying to be.Tom Wilkinson, a brilliant actor having a brilliant year with the incredible, In The Bedroom, costars as Sir Knolte.He would also go on to a lifetime performance in Michael Clayton in 2007 among other roles.Daryl Mitchell, himself a comedy heavyweight in Galaxy Quest and Home Fries prior to this film has a small but decent role here as an amusement park co-worker.Are there ridiculous scenes regarding the difficulties of horseback riding and such?Certainly.Are there likes aplenty like, 'Tis roadkill?Lol. Yes. But that's so silly it just cracks me up.I laughed out loud quite a bit here.And there's a Beanie Man song on the soundtrack.What else can one asketh for?

This film isn't fantastic, but it is far from dismal as many people here have made it out to be.Sure, the premise of the movie is silly, but most of these types of comedy movies are.

More annoying than funny, I am hoping that I was not supposed to take Black Knight seriously because it just doesn't make any sense. (I won't even attempt to mention the plot holes because there are just too many, and I think they must have been intentional.) It is all about a black man who mistakenly travels back in time to the middle ages, and while he is there, he makes a mockery of everything. If he was not so annoying, it might have been a decent and funny film. Instead, it just became a film centered around the jokes and antics of a clueless black man playing 'dumb' and doing his best to ridicule everything about the middle ages. It's just too annoying to be funny.
