"Dennis the Menace" is a cute film and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. That being said, it's not for everyone. For really young kids, the film is surprisingly scary...so I'd either watch it with them or skip it entirely. And, for teens, well, they hate family movies...so tell them to text their friends while the rest of you watch and enjoy the film.The first portion consists of Dennis annoying poor Mr. Wilson (Walter Mathau) in 1001 different ways. Most of the time, it's because Dennis is just too hyper and inqusitive and finds many different ways to get into Mr. Wilson's things and ruin them. Later, after Mr. Wilson blows his temper and Dennis runs away, the film turns darker as a sleazy looking hobo kidnaps Dennis and threatens to hurt him.This final portion is the part that young and very impressionable kids should probably not see. I wouldn't let most kids under 5 watch the film or at least I'd be there to reassure them it will be find. But it is quite funny and enjoyable...and adults and older kids will know that no matter what happens, Dennis will be safe. It's also a bit disgusting...wish it hadn't been so. But on balance, it's a fun little family film...one that I think even most grumpy adults could enjoy. And, as such, it seems a tad underrated on IMDB. Lots of fun for most of the family.

For me, this cinema version featuring the innocent mischief of cartoonist Hank Ketcham's precocious hyperactive preschooler, Dennis (The Menace) Mitchell, is a classic sleeper. Remarkable performances by Mason Gamble (as "Dennis Mitchell") and Walter Matthau (as "Mr. Wilson") help to mold the screenplay into a delightful light-hearted comedy intended for the whole family. I, personally, look forward to the day that its presentation is offered in DVD format.

As I write this, Dennis the Menace is running on cable in the background. I'm half-listening to it, and I'm not watching it. It's that uninvolving.Great actors, a talented director and writer still can't save a bad script. John Hughes, fairly fresh from Home Alone, had contractual obligations to fulfill, and adapted Hank Ketchum's classic comic strip for film. But studio bosses like to meddle, and I suspect there was a lot of "change this, change that, it'll make more money" sorta stuff that flew around during production.
It boils down to this. Walter Matthau. Chris Lloyd, Joan Plowright, and everyone in this film is wasting their time. The whole movie is pointless and dumb, and if you really want to watch Dennis at his best, go find the old black & white television episodes from the late Fifties. Even all the Oscar-caliber talent in this thing couldn't save it from mediocrity.
Recommendations. Want to see these actors at their best? Fine. Here's what to rent:For Walter Matthau, The Odd Couple. For Joan Plowright, I Love You To Death. For Chris Lloyd, Back To The Future, all three of them. For Paul Winfield, Roots. Better yet, the Star Trek episode "Darmok". and for this film's director, Nick Castle, The Last Starfighter.Just stay away from this mess. Maybe that way it'll end up buried in the vaults somewhere and vanish into well-deserved obscurity.

This film had a very good point : it stands on something solid, like the old TV serie and the comic strip. Some similar films don't have this, like these awful Home Alone movies.The film can also count on the talent of Mr. Matthau. He's ideal for playing Mr. Wilson. And the kid is very alright. Another good point is that the film do not have a great success and it provides us from those ugly sequels. Sometimes a bit violent, but in a comic strip way. Good fun!

Like everyone else my age, I read "Dennis The Menace" comic strips and comic books when I was a kid. He and his dog and neighbors all provided laughs. With a cast that included Walter Matthau, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Plowright and Lea Thompson, I was sure this would provide laughs for me now as an adult, as well. Wrong.This was NOT funny, just one stupid gag after another. There was no real story line and most of the characters were annoying, not humorous. No wonder this was another disappointing "bomb" at the box office.Not everything is bad. Matthau is "Mr. Wilson" true to form. He looks and acts like you figure he would out of the comic strip. Dennis' parents pretty much do the same and some of the stuff is fairly funny.But there are some big-time disquieting aspects of this movie. "Dennis" is not the innocent- but-mischievous kid of the comics, but a mean-spirited, sadistic kid in here. Did I really hear Matthau utter "GD" three times without making it sound like it was blasphemous? Oh, how clever these Hollywood folks are in their clueless idea of "family fare." Speaking of that, what was the purpose of the sleazy character "Switchblade Sam?" In this age of child molestation and worse, this kind of character is funny? A guy hanging around schoolyards making threats is funny? No, not really.Once again - clueless Hollywood. What Dennis does to him is not funny, either - it's over-the-line. You would be appalled if your kid acted like this. This is far cry from the intention of comic book writer. It is typical of the sick screen writers of today.If you think I'm over-reacting, check Roger Ebert's review of this movie. I don't agree with him on many films but he was extremely offended by that character, too, and thought it had no legitimate reason for being in this movie. Good for him. This should be a "G" rated movie. It's "Dennis The Menace," for cryin' out loud, so why the PG attitude?

I don't know why 'Dennis' only receives a 4.7 rating on IMDb because it is a rather enjoyable film with plenty of cute/funny moments that leave you chuckling so surely deserves a few points more. Based on the comic book and Eighties cartoon, this film centres on five-year-old Dennis, a boisterous little boy who just wants to help but everything he touches turns into a catastrophe. He hero-worships his miserable next-door neighbour Mr Wilson despite the old grump being the sort who thinks children should be seen and not heard. The main storyline is about a thieving hobo Switchblade Sam who has turned up in Dennis' town to make a picking except he hasn't counted on a certain blond-haired moppet making his life a misery!Mason Gamble was just so adorable as Dennis, giving a very engaging and energetic performance that leaves kids wanting to be his friend and adults wanting to adopt him. He's the sort of child who is cute but charming enough to not be just another cutesy Hollywood brat. Walter Mathau was also perfectly cast as the cantankerous Mr Wilson who just doesn't have time for small children and he has a very nice rapport with Joan Plowright, who played the exasperated Mrs Wilson. I also have to mention Christopher Lloyd as he is totally unrecognisable as the filthy, slimy Switchblade Sam and how he is just hilarious as the hardened thief who quickly regrets ever meeting Dennis.In many ways, this film is more involving and enjoyable than similar films such as 'Home Alone' since Dennis is a very sweet, likable character compared with the more cocky and, at times, grating Kevin. There is also few sugary, overly-sentimental moments that often crop up in family films. It would have been nice to see more of interactions between Mr Wilson and Dennis since that was always a great focal point of the cartoon series but this film is still a worthy successor. It should keep fans of the cartoon amused as well as thrill young kids who may not have ever heard of Dennis before now.

"Hank Ketcham's popular comic-strip kid comes to the big screen in 'Dennis the Menace', a delightful family comedy from writer/producer John Hughes, the creative force behind several of the most popular movies ever," according to the original Time/Warner synopsis scribers, "Young Mason Gamble (who won the title role over 20,000 hopefuls) is all-boy, all-menace, all-Dennis, right down to his slingshot and dog Ruff. As Dennis' long-suffering neighbor George Wilson, Walter Matthau is a marvel of lovable grumpiness. And Christopher Lloyd adds a new wrinkle to Dennis' neighborhood as a villain who learns he can't match wits with a certain 5-year-old dynamo. He may be a minor, but he's a major delight." When an adaptation of a classic property is as off base as this, it inevitably raises the question, "What were they thinking?" "Home Alone" (1990), probably. Mr. Hughes, and a few other crew members, worked on both films. The plot isn't the same, exactly, but the resemblances are there. And, they are uncomfortable additions to "Dennis the Menace" of the comic strip and TV series starring Jay North. As the mischievous kid with the cowlick, Mr. North was perfect in the role. Nobody told young Gamble how to wear the hair (not that it would have mattered), Mr. Matthau is almost as unconvincing, and they have no rapport. Violent, grungy and farting in the wind, Mr. Lloyd (as "Switchblade" Sam) is especially unwelcome. While only minor players, Robert Stanton and Lea Thompson capture their characters convincingly.*** Dennis the Menace (6/24/93) Nick Castle ~ Mason Gamble, Walter Matthau, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Plowright

This film is one of the few films to offend me. It proclaims itself to be a children's movie, but is so full of gratuitous (presumably meant to be "comical") violence, nasty "pranks" and the gruesome sequence with Christopher Lloyd being tortured (nearly to death) by the obnoxious brat Dennis makes DENNIS THE MENACE entirely inappropriate for children. The fact that it is a terrible film in all other respects makes it entirely inappropriate viewing for adults, as well! Would you want your child to repeat any of the "antics" Dennis gets away with in real life? They would land your child in jail or the hospital; vicious films like this and HOME ALONE, PROBLEM CHILD, etc. have no place in your child's life. Another alleged "children's film"  to stay away from for its grotesque, unrelenting, mean-spirited violence and adults-only humor is Dreamwork's MOUSE HUNT. Let you children watch these films at your own risk!

Dennis the Menace (1993) is a movie that my daughter and I recently watched together on Tubi. The storyline follows a young man named Dennis who is a menace to his neighbor, Mr. Wilson. One inauspicious week Mr. & Mrs. Wilson agree to watch Dennis while his parents are out of town on business. Any and everything that can go wrong, while Mr. Wilson watches Dennis, does go wrong...This movie is directed by Nick Castle (The Last Starfighter) and stars Walter Matthau (The Bad News Bears), Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), Lea Thompson (Back to the Future), Joan Plowright (The Entertainer) and Paul Winfield (Mars Attacks!).This has a strong Home Alone feel to it with a tremendous cast, laugh out loud slapstick comedy and a character that is cute and easy to root for. I loved both Walter Matthau and Christopher Lloyd in this throughout the movie. They deliver entertaining characters and hilarious reactions to circumstances. The opening aspirin scene is a legendary moment in this picture and was a perfect way to get it started. Lloyd's shenanigans were a perfect way to end it also. The full circle perspectives of characters evolving definitely brings a smile to your face and is a perfect way to conclude the picture.Overall, this is a worthwhile family film that's an absolute must see. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.

I like a good slapstick movie as much as the next guy.If the next guy is John Hughes, though, he has me beat.You have a property like "Dennis the Menace" and you want to make a movie out of it?  Fine.  Just don't get John Hughes to do the scriptwork.  For some reason, the spirits of "Home Alone"s past haunt him and possess his typewriter to recycle the same jokes over and over.He does manage to eke some sweet observances about the friendships between kids and even between kids and gruff old neighbors like Mr. Wilson (Matthau, who seems to be having a high old time).  Even suburban life is observed with a good deal of truth.  And who doesn't know at least one family in the neighborhood who has a child that all the babysitters refuse to sit with?One thing that offsets the pranks here that the "Home Alone" pranks didn't have is the fact that Dennis (Gamble) isn't a vindictive little kid.  he's just an innocent who happens to push the wrong button at the wrong time. Then, trying to cover up, he ends up making a worse mess than before.  And Mr. Wilson is usually on the receiving end, whether he likes it or not.If the movie had followed thsi tangent all the way through, it may have been a bigger success.  But when Switchblade Sam (Lloyd) is introduced, his scrungy form of evil kind of throws a monkey wrench in the works.  Even when Dennis unknowlingly waylays him into a blubbering, emotionally scarred mess, it feels more like a Hughes movie than part of Dennis' wholesome universe.As it is, this movie feels like less a "Menace" than does Hughes, who refuses to let old formulas lie.Five stars.  All for the Dennis/Mr. Wilson chemistry.  And for suburbia in all its splendor.Next time, John Hughes, check Marv and Harry at the door.

Great cast! My favorite is Walter Matthau as he nails the role as the reasonably grumpy Mr. Wilson. I also love Joan Plowright as Martha Wilson.The story isn't all that bad - you'll get a few chuckles here and there. A couple of heartwarming moments are splashed into the mix. Overall it's a fun watch.7/10.

Dennis the menace, as the last word points it out right away, is a menacing movie.It is supposed to be for kids, but I remember that I was pretty scared of the movie and I thought that Dennis was just an utter crazy boy, scary in his way. I know that he is kind of supposed to be scary for adults, but as a kid I couldn't really identify myself with anybody in the movie; you're not really involved.Furthermore, a lot of the cuts are directed in a way to submit horror, but in a gentle way. That is like showing us a dangerous car accident but underlining it with cheery music. Something is awfully wrong, it does not feel right. Kids will be frightened by the villain, Mr. Wilson, the girl with the dolls and by the way the director Nick Castle brought the ideas to the screen (only Mrs Wilson is a charming, nice person). This movie simply is not for kids.You might think then this is for adults, for moms and dads, to watch with their children... nnnnno. You see, the problem is that, while you actually are capable of feeling of how much Dennis is a menace for retired men, you never really think that he's an interesting kid; he's very naive, over the top naive which is basically it.The movie then is not for children, nor their parents or anybody else. Especially not for teenagers, nowadays they watch films like Matrix at the age of thirteen. The result is that this movie is probably for no one.4/10

This came after Home Alone - but it is probably rather a remake of an older movie. Which would make Home Alone a copycat (of probably many things). And this I'd say is sweeter in many departments and not as mean as Kevin is. But you may disagree and I may be wrong with that.I do know that it has quite the range of great actors in it. Walter Matthau for one, who really brings gravitas and then some to his role. Even the silliest of things can be elevated if performed by such an amazing and gifted actor. Overall I am not the biggest fan of pranks, no matter the context, but they work here most of the time, especially because Dennis seems so innocent.Also this is a family movie and as such there are a lot of merits this has on its side.

In 1959, a character named Dennis the Menace was made into a comic strip cartoon. Now, it is adapted by film. Dennis the Menace stars Mason Gamble as the troubled kid who keeps bothering his next-door neighbor, Mr. Wilson, played by Walter Matthau. The movie center around the neighborhood where Dennis engages in mean-spirited pranks that even injured Mr. Wilson. Lea Thompson plays Dennis' mother. She said that Dennis is out of school and on summer vacation. But, why in the world would a brat like Dennis would even be out of school when he was mean to Mr. Wilson? I don't know, but the background is not quite right. Another character is Switchblade Sam, played by Christopher Lloyd. Now, his character is menacing as Dennis. Why? Well, to put it in one way, Switchblade Sam is a probably an escaped convict or a killer. His character is not right for this movie. Especially in a kids movie. As for Mason Gamble, he is an annoying little kid, who I think has no respect for Matthau's character. In one scene, Wilson plans to have a party over his house, and the flower he was growing was blooming when the moon was out. Suddenly, Dennis pop out of the house to say that Wilson's house is robbed by Switchblade Sam. It seems that somebody must have pick Mason Gamble by mistake. This movie deserves a 2 star rating. ★★ 2 stars.

First of all it has to be said that this film has no relationship whatsoever with the cartoon comic 'Dennis the Menace' you may have read as a child. With that out of the way you can now enjoy the film for what it is, not how you may have remembered a character from your youth.The film is superbly cast with Walter Matthau playing the grumpy old 'Mr Wilson' and a young Mason Gamble playing the role of 'Dennis'. Matthau really is on top form as strong as he was with Jack Lemmon in the 'Grumpy Old Men' films. Gamble is fantastic as the adorable but mischievous 5 year old and shows an acting ability way beyond his years with superb comic timing and wonderful catch lines.Full of laughs, crazy antics, hilarious childhood expression and the odd touching moment too, this is an entertaining film that keeps on giving scene after scene. It's a Sunday afternoon film to watch either on your own or with the kids, either way it won't disappoint!

The characters doesnt look like the comics but who cares? I love it

There are some things that went wrong with this film and I never read the comic strip, but I don't think it's as bad as everyone says it is. I'll start off with the positives.The acting on the whole isn't that bad. Walter Matthau did a good job as Mr. Wilson as did Robert Stanton, Lea Thompson and Joan Plowright, but I think that Mason Gamble steals the show as the most likable title character who got the personality and characterization right. Even his chemistry with Walter Matthau was decent. Also, Christopher Lloyd was very sinister as the main villain and he steals the show as well. The scenery is nice and it has some nice cinematography. I also liked the music from Jerry Goldsmith. Not the best here, but still worth listening.However, the story, while having its nice moments, falls into the predictable zone and the script feels flat and would've been so much better. Some of the humor gave me some chuckles (Dennis causing some trouble to Mr. Wilson and the baked beans farting scene), but some of them lacked wit and the pacing was very mediocre.Overall, uneven with it's story and pacing, but not as bad as some say it is. I'm giving this a 6/10 because of it's likable cast and some nice scenery.

"Dennis the Menace" is unique in its own way because it's observant.  This movie made me laugh at stuff i've always laughed at and things i'd never thought I would laugh at.  The film can be surprisingly innocent at times and sincere and heartwarming.  And the kid who plays Dennis is a way better actor than Macaulay Culkin.  I liked the film for its imagination and humor.  A good film.  I also liked how they showed Dennis trying to resist the temptation to do something bad but can't resist.

"Dennis the Menace" is a cute film and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. That being said, it's not for everyone.

Mr. George Wilson (Walter Matthau) is a retired postman with loving wife Martha (Joan Plowright). He is tired of the irreverent boy living next door, Dennis the Menace. He is hosting the party for the Garden Society and desperate to show off his flower. Dennis has loving parents (Robert Stanton, Lea Thompson) who treat him with kid gloves. He hates being forced to spend time with Margaret Wade. It's an idyllic town life until the arrival of Switchblade Sam (Christopher Lloyd). Dennis' parents go away for work and the Wilson has the babysit the Menace.I love Walter Matthau and the kid is rambunctious. I like Dennis' family. I love Margaret and the other kids. Switchblade Sam makes no sense being in this movie universe. I think John Hughes is trying to recreate Home Alone. It's a big mistake. The movie is split in two. I find the parts without Switchblade Sam fun especially with Matthau. It's got a childlike innocent tone with a splash of modern irreverence and that's what so great about it. Switchblade Sam has no place in that world.

Another Gem for Mr. John Hughes. A rare Good adaption from the cartoons.Overall a fun movie. But Dennis is one annoying kid and his parents don't do anything about his disgusting behaviour. He is as bad as 2020 children because he destroys lives whether or not it's an accident.Still Dennis needs to have parents that know how to parent.The movie has heart and sympathy.

If you ever watched the cartoon, or (if there was one) read the comics, then you would know the troublesome little boy of this film. It isn't the most funny disaster type film I have seen, but some parts of it do have some interesting cartoon like comedy. Walter Matthau as Mr. George Wilson is very good at showing his hate, or rather frustration, with Dennis the Menace (Razzie nominated Mason Gamble). Dennis loses his teeth, bakes paint on a barbecue and throw a burning marshmallow onto his forehead! A disastrous movie with a disastrous kid. Also starring Joan Plowright as Mrs. Martha Wilson, Christopher Lloyd as Switchblade Sam (Town Robber) and American Pie's Natasha Lyonne as Polly. Worth watching!

This film is a great little family comedy. I loved it as a kid, and it still holds up today. Walter Matthau is delightfully miserable, Mason Gamble is chasing, and Christopher Lloyd is unrecognisably fiendish.
Get the popcorn, sit the kids down, and enjoy...whilst remembering to tell the kids not to try ANYTHING Dennis does!

Great cast! My favorite is Walter Matthau as he nails the role as the reasonably grumpy Mr. Wilson. I also love Joan Plowright as Martha Wilson.The story isn't all that bad - you'll get a few chuckles here and there. A couple of heartwarming moments are splashed into the mix.

This movie is without a doubt identical to the comic strip.  The characters look exactly alike, especially Dennis's parents.  And I don't think anyone could have played a better Mr. Wilson than Walter Mattau.  This is what makes the movie so good.  Another familiar actor is Christopher Lloyd (from the "Back to the Future" trilogy and "The Pagemaster) who plays the robber. I remember when I rented this at my local grocery store, I saw the scene where the robber kidnaps Dennis and ties him up.  Then Dennis tells him the only right way to tie him up so that he won't be able to get away.  The robber has handcuffs and the key falls into the beans he's cooking.  Dennis is forced to feed the robber beans in order to find the key.  After this the robber farts in the fire.  This scene was cut when shown on TNT.  Watch this movie and see for yourself how wonderful it is.

This film is one of the few films to offend me. It proclaims itself to be a children's movie, but is so full of gratuitous (presumably meant to be "comical") violence, nasty "pranks" and the gruesome sequence with Christopher Lloyd being tortured (nearly to death) by the obnoxious brat Dennis makes DENNIS THE MENACE entirely inappropriate for children.

I loved both Walter Matthau and Christopher Lloyd in this throughout the movie. They deliver entertaining characters and hilarious reactions to circumstances. The opening aspirin scene is a legendary moment in this picture and was a perfect way to get it started. Lloyd's shenanigans were a perfect way to end it also. The full circle perspectives of characters evolving definitely brings a smile to your face and is a perfect way to conclude the picture.Overall, this is a worthwhile family film that's an absolute must see. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.

I like a good slapstick movie as much as the next guy.If the next guy is John Hughes, though, he has me beat.You have a property like "Dennis the Menace" and you want to make a movie out of it?  Fine.  Just don't get John Hughes to do the scriptwork.  For some reason, the spirits of "Home Alone"s past haunt him and possess his typewriter to recycle the same jokes over and over.He does manage to eke some sweet observances about the friendships between kids and even between kids and gruff old neighbors like Mr. Wilson (Matthau, who seems to be having a high old time).  Even suburban life is observed with a good deal of truth.  And who doesn't know at least one family in the neighborhood who has a child that all the babysitters refuse to sit with?One thing that offsets the pranks here that the "Home Alone" pranks didn't have is the fact that Dennis (Gamble) isn't a vindictive little kid.  he's just an innocent who happens to push the wrong button at the wrong time. Then, trying to cover up, he ends up making a worse mess than before.  And Mr. Wilson is usually on the receiving end, whether he likes it or not.If the movie had followed thsi tangent all the way through, it may have been a bigger success.  But when Switchblade Sam (Lloyd) is introduced, his scrungy form of evil kind of throws a monkey wrench in the works.  Even when Dennis unknowlingly waylays him into a blubbering, emotionally scarred mess, it feels more like a Hughes movie than part of Dennis' wholesome universe.As it is, this movie feels like less a "Menace" than does Hughes, who refuses to let old formulas lie.Five stars.  All for the Dennis/Mr. Wilson chemistry.  And for suburbia in all its splendor.Next time, John Hughes, check Marv and Harry at the door.

The actors do a great job and the comedy is pretty funny and actually made me laugh.the characters are believable and the interactions with each are great.

Dennis the menace, as the last word points it out right away, is a menacing movie.It is supposed to be for kids, but I remember that I was pretty scared of the movie and I thought that Dennis was just an utter crazy boy, scary in his way. I know that he is kind of supposed to be scary for adults, but as a kid I couldn't really identify myself with anybody in the movie; you're not really involved.Furthermore, a lot of the cuts are directed in a way to submit horror, but in a gentle way. That is like showing us a dangerous car accident but underlining it with cheery music. Something is awfully wrong, it does not feel right. Kids will be frightened by the villain, Mr. Wilson, the girl with the dolls and by the way the director Nick Castle brought the ideas to the screen (only Mrs Wilson is a charming, nice person). This movie simply is not for kids.You might think then this is for adults, for moms and dads, to watch with their children... nnnnno. You see, the problem is that, while you actually are capable of feeling of how much Dennis is a menace for retired men, you never really think that he's an interesting kid; he's very naive, over the top naive which is basically it.The movie then is not for children, nor their parents or anybody else. Especially not for teenagers, nowadays they watch films like Matrix at the age of thirteen. The result is that this movie is probably for no one.4/10

This came after Home Alone - but it is probably rather a remake of an older movie. Which would make Home Alone a copycat (of probably many things). And this I'd say is sweeter in many departments and not as mean as Kevin is. But you may disagree and I may be wrong with that.I do know that it has quite the range of great actors in it. Walter Matthau for one, who really brings gravitas and then some to his role. Even the silliest of things can be elevated if performed by such an amazing and gifted actor. Overall I am not the biggest fan of pranks, no matter the context, but they work here most of the time, especially because Dennis seems so innocent.Also this is a family movie and as such there are a lot of merits this has on its side.

In 1959, a character named Dennis the Menace was made into a comic strip cartoon. Now, it is adapted by film. Dennis the Menace stars Mason Gamble as the troubled kid who keeps bothering his next-door neighbor, Mr. Wilson, played by Walter Matthau. The movie center around the neighborhood where Dennis engages in mean-spirited pranks that even injured Mr. Wilson. Lea Thompson plays Dennis' mother. She said that Dennis is out of school and on summer vacation. But, why in the world would a brat like Dennis would even be out of school when he was mean to Mr. Wilson? I don't know, but the background is not quite right. Another character is Switchblade Sam, played by Christopher Lloyd. Now, his character is menacing as Dennis. Why? Well, to put it in one way, Switchblade Sam is a probably an escaped convict or a killer. His character is not right for this movie. Especially in a kids movie. As for Mason Gamble, he is an annoying little kid, who I think has no respect for Matthau's character. In one scene, Wilson plans to have a party over his house, and the flower he was growing was blooming when the moon was out. Suddenly, Dennis pop out of the house to say that Wilson's house is robbed by Switchblade Sam. It seems that somebody must have pick Mason Gamble by mistake. This movie deserves a 2 star rating. ★★ 2 stars.

First of all it has to be said that this film has no relationship whatsoever with the cartoon comic 'Dennis the Menace' you may have read as a child. With that out of the way you can now enjoy the film for what it is, not how you may have remembered a character from your youth.The film is superbly cast with Walter Matthau playing the grumpy old 'Mr Wilson' and a young Mason Gamble playing the role of 'Dennis'. Matthau really is on top form as strong as he was with Jack Lemmon in the 'Grumpy Old Men' films. Gamble is fantastic as the adorable but mischievous 5 year old and shows an acting ability way beyond his years with superb comic timing and wonderful catch lines.Full of laughs, crazy antics, hilarious childhood expression and the odd touching moment too, this is an entertaining film that keeps on giving scene after scene. It's a Sunday afternoon film to watch either on your own or with the kids, either way it won't disappoint!

The characters doesnt look like the comics but who cares? I love it

For those who remember Jay North as the lively little kid who seems to take an
almost fiendish delight in tormenting grumpy neighbor Mr. Wilson, this new
Dennis The Menace feature film will bring back some good memories. Warner
Brothers even had the foresight to cast Hollywood's number one specialist at
curmudgeon roles Walter Matthau as the ever grumpy Wilson.Young Mason Gamble is Dennis Mitchell, problem child deluxe. Parents Robert
Stanton and Lea Thompson have trouble getting babysitters as Dennis's reputation is known far and wide. The next door neighbor Wilsons played byz
Matthau and Joan Plowright take him, at least Plowright makes the offer.The usual mayhem follows with Matthau the brunt. But when robber Christopher Lloyd steals Matthau's valuable coin collection, Dennis is on the
case. What follows is what you see in the Home Alone films.Gamble made a nice and appealing Dennis. But even natural scene stealers
like kids are up against it when dealing with Walter Matthau. Poor Gamble
didn't have a chance.Dennis The Menace is a nice family film for a family movie night.
