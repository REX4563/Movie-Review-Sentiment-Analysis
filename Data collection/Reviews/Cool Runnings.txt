Hands up all Jamaicans.  (There are only 2.6 million people in Jamaica - so I know you don't account for a large percentage of the English-speaking world.)  Hands up all those people with any interest at all in bobsledding. Hah!  I knew it!  No-one.That's why `Cool Runnings' succeeds.  It depends not at all on aggressive nationalism (it couldn't afford to, with a constituency of 2.6 million), and people of all countries are free to participate in the Jamaicans' perfectly reasonable patriotism.  (Probably even the Swiss, whose bobsled team comes across as more than a trifle arrogant.)  Nor is there any of that worship of a particular sport that makes baseball movies so unendurable for people outside of North America, Cuba and Japan.  (Not that I have any evidence that baseball movies are popular in Cuba or Japan.)There isn't any power-of-positive-thinking psychobabble, either - at least, it doesn't dominate.  The four Jamaican bobsledders are separate people with different goals and ways of thinking.  The coach (played beautifully by John Candy, who proves that he can act without playing the clown) doesn't ram a particular ideology down his players' throats.  I doubt that any sports film has a more civilised and reasonable coach.It comes down to this: we are given a reason to care about the characters, unrelated to nationality; and we are given a story that's worth following, even if we would never follow the sport itself.  The clichés are fewer than usual and never offensive.  It's a sweet film, and I doubt there's more than a handfull of people who could resist its charm.

It's probably a word game that has been used many times before, but "Cool Runnings" is a very 'cool' movie that offered me a lot of fun and laughter. And since this is a comedy and not a documentary, that's all I'm asking of this movie.If you hope to see a documentary on how the first Jamaican bobsled team was created and how they got to the Olympics than you'll have to look for something else. This movie has been inspired on the true events, but never pretends to be faithful to the truth. Does that mean that this movie isn't any good? No, certainly not. I loved to see how these four guys were transfered from sprinters to bobsledders and I couldn't help laughing all the time when seeing their reactions on, for instance, the cold and the snow.This isn't the greatest movie ever and yes it is full of clichés, but they all work and it never bothered me once. However, don't expect to see a ridiculous comedy with no content either, because it still has a good story and plenty of emotions and excitement to offer. I reward this movie with an 8/10.

This one of those family-oriented sports movies that I have fond memories of from my elementary school days. Off the top of my head, I can name The Air Up There, Iron Will, and the Mighty Ducks in this category as well. They weren't masterpieces, per se, but they were pleasant, fun, and sometimes inspirational. The thing about a sports movie is that the passion that a dedicated athlete feels is usually something that can translate itself visually on screen. For instance, if you were to make a movie about a passionate chess player, it's not as exciting to watch the final climactic moment when the hero checkmates his opponent, as it is to watch a game winning shot. What I'm getting to is that one of the draws of a sports movie is being exposed to that passion and desire in our hero. In this case, the hero is Jamaican sprinter Derice Bannock who was accidentally tripped during the Olympic trials, but is determined to make the Olympics anyway. Since track's no longer an option for him, he figures why not start the nation's first bobsledding team, since a bobsled team hasn't been fielded yet. He also is encouraged in the sport by the fact that a friend of his dad happens to be a bobsled coach and he might be able to help. The bobsled coach declines citing as his reasons that there's no ice in Jamaica, that there's not enough time to train, that Derice doesn't have 3 other people which is needed to form a team, that he doesn't even think Derice was a good runner, and that he doesn't even like coaching anymore.Nevertheless, Derice manages to convince the coach, and get three teammates consisting of his best friend, the guy who tripped him in the trials, and another sprinter who got tripped in the trials along with him. This is one of the better sources of entertainment in the film because the dynamics of this team are formed under such unusual circumstance. For instance, Yul, one of the two who got tripped during the trials, still hasn't forgiven Junior, the tripper.The film very cleverly finds a balance between the inspirational element of this story and the humor. Essentially, Derice the most determined member of the group, is a person who we come to admire for his persistence, and maybe that's why it's a good family film, someone kids can look up to. The humor comes from Derice's friend, Sanka, who says a lot of funny stuff. This really is the only way the movie could work because if Derice was funny and told jokes, you wouldn't take him seriously, and if Sanka was more determined about winning, his jokes would sound out of context. The two guys in the middle of the bobsled, both metaphorically and literally, add to the film in their own ways but on a smaller scale. The late John Candy plays the coach and fills the part well. The other notable thing about the film is it's ending. Provided, this is your first viewing, it really does a lot for the movie. I won't give it away, but the ending is unpredictable yet equally satisfying, something I don't often see. However, I wonder, since this was filmed only five years after the Calgary Olympics, how familiar would viewers have been with the actual event that inspired the film. If they knew the story of the '88 Jamaican bobsled team in its entirety, than the impact of that ending would have been lost.

This entertaining movie, based on the true story of the Jamaican Bob Sled Team's (yes, you heard right - Jamaican Bob Sled Team) participation in the 1985 Winter Olympics is a funny film with a warm heart that moves to an inspiring ending. The story, about a group of Jamaican athletes who were prevented from competing as runners and so sought a different (!) venue in order to participate, has many funny moments. The late John Candy, of whom I am no fan, is very good here; his role as the coach with a checkered past calls for some real dramatic work as well as comedy. The team is a very likeable bunch (with varying acting abilities) and the viewer is rooting for them all the way as they demonstrate great courage in snatching their own kind of victory from the jaws of defeat; the ending is a real lump-in-the-throater.Good flick, but a caveat for viewing with the kiddos - the language is a tad rough in a couple of spots.

It's 1987 Jamaica. Derice Bannock (Leon) fails to qualify for the Olympics 100-metre dash in Seoul when Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) falls and trips him and Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba). He is devastated and told to wait for another 4 years. He sees Irving Blitzer (John Candy) in an old photo with his father. Irv is a former medal winner friend of his father who is now a bookie living in Jamaica. He has the idea to start a Jamaican bobsled team with his bumbling push cart friend Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug). Along with rich boy Junior, angry Yul, and Irv, they head to the Calgary Winter Olympics. This is simply a fun movie. It's mostly due to the characters and the actors. Doug E. Doug delivers the light hearted humor. There's a real good-nature charm to this movie. It follows a familiar formula.

I remember watching this movie when I was a kid and loving it. It is one of those feel good movies that you think is corny but somehow avoids that label. The characters are funny and endearing. John Candy balances the broken side of his character along with the inspirational side of his character very believably. Doug E Doug has some hilarious dialogs. You feel yourself rooting for the team with more feeling than you expect. The director does well by not focusing on the racial aspect of the movie and converting it to just another movie of black vs. white. Obviously you cannot expect any brilliant acting or movie making but all in all this movie is a must see for families. Four Jamaicans in a bob sled is more entertaining than it looks.

When I saw "Cool Runnings" the first time, I mostly cracked up at the line about drawing a line down the middle of Yul Brynner's head (cut me some slack; I was nine years old). Nowadays, I understand that the movie did focus on a real story and so at least had that value. While it was silly at times and did try to pull at emotions at times, I still consider it a pretty admirable movie. John Candy (who would have turned 57 today) plays one of his slightly more serious roles as the Jamaican bobsled team's manager; I always say that these movies show what we lost when he died. But among other things, I just like to see Jamaica. I mean, the country that gave us calypso and reggae also had a bobsled team! All in all, a pretty good movie.

When the Jamaican sprinter Derice Bannock (Leon) is disqualified to the Olympic Games due to a silly accident, he envision the chance to participate in bobsleigh modality. He meets the dishonored couch Irving Blitzer (John Candy), who is living in the tropical country after two gold medals and elimination due to cheating, and convinces him to couch the first Jamaican Bobsled Team. They form a group with the push-cart driver Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug), the sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) and the rich Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) and without any sponsor, fly to Calgary, Alberta, Canada to participate of the XV Olympic Winter Games at -25o C. In the end, they become winners without winning the game.Based on the true surprising participation of Jamaica in the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in the winter sport known as bobsleigh, or bobsled, in which teams make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sled, this comedy gives a very important message: the importance of teamwork and objective to make winners. Therefore, "Cool Runnings" is a great entertainment for audiences of any age. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Jamaica Abaixo de Zero" ("Jamaica below Zero")

It might not be historically accurate - and you know what, some of the best films aren't - but I believe, hand on heart, that Cool Runnings is one of greatest films ever made.Cool Runnings is absolutely hilarious with a wonderful blend of slapstick comedy, one liners, colourful characters and absurdity, however its comic achievements are well documented, and for this reason I will take them as read.Cool Runnings is an exploration of a number of the weightiest themes a film can deal with, such as racism, poverty, pride, passion, forgiveness and self-belief. Cool Runnings tackles all of these themes head-on without losing an ounce of its charm, humour, or family-fun.A superbly played Joseph Gruel is the prime embodiment of the racism the Jamaicans face on the hill, and his story is very moving. So too is the voyage of self-discovery and forgiveness embarked on by disgraced coach Erv Blitzer (John Candy). The team themselves are a wonderful advert for teamwork and the little island of Jamaica. Each one is wise, bold in the face of their respective adversity, and has an intriguing story to tell.The ending of Cool Runnings also ranks as one of the greatest. It masterfully avoids the back-slapping, one-dimensional and predictable ending it looks to be approaching, a trap that so many other similar 'feel-good' films fall into. Instead Cool Runnings brings together all of the themes that have been explored, in one emotionally charged final scene.99% will disagree with something I have written above. But I first watched the film 15 years ago and it has stayed with me ever since. I have watched it around 100 times now, and I still shed a tear at the end...no other film has ever brought me even close to that.If you take nothing else from this review. Watch Cool Runnings. It is so much better than the clever-arsed, blockbuster-biased critics will have you believe. Forget the highly forgettable cheese like Remember the Titans, The Mighty Ducks and all the rest. Pull up a chair, get the phone on divert, and sit back and enjoy the only 'feel good' film worth watching.

The screenplay is intelligent, focused and clever. I much enjoyed this film, mostly because of the convincing characters. I am aware of much of the criticism around this movie, claiming it is bad and not worth seeing. To all those who have said these things, I have to ask: What film were you watching? With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from 1993. I laughed and was moved and all of that good stuff. At the end of the day, it's a fun, entertaining film. Wonderful movie, and I should know, I practically grew up on it. An excellent and difficult production, bolstered by great performances.

This movie was loosely based on a true story. Specifically there was a 4-man bobsled team from Jamaica that competed in the Calgary Olympics, and they crashed the sled. Everything else in the movie was fiction, written by a lazy screenwriter with no research. They deserved better than this farce. I rated this as a 5 of 10, because the writers could have at least tried to tell the true story! Too bad, they didn't even care.The 1988 Calgary Olympics were the last of the "open era" of Olympic bobsledding. There were 41 sleds in the 2-man race, and 26 sleds in the 4-man race. The problem was that medals were decided by hundredths of a second and every 1400 pound sled under 2-3 gforce in the banked corners damaged the smooth ice. The 10 or so medal contending sleds all faced different ice conditions over the 4 runs of the 2 day race. Complaints from the elite teams finally forced the FIBT to introduce seeding, like ski racing had, and stronger entry standards (a minimum number of World Cup races in order to compete at the Olympics). True to the Olympic ideals the "youth" of the World could still compete, but the top teams in World Cup would go down first in each heat.At the Calgary Olympics the medals were won by East Germans, Swiss (Gold in 4-man) and the (Latvian) Soviet Union, grabbing Gold with their skinny 2-man sled, in their second Olympics in bobsledding. The Jamaican driver, Dudley Stokes with Michael White finished the 2-man race in 30th. They were good athletes, but lacked in driving experience. The crash in the 4-man race put them in last, but heroes forever! Eight years later they were ready, at the1994 Olympics the Jamaicans finished 14th in 4-man, ahead of the USA team!In Calgary there were bobsledders from Taiwan, Australia, Calgary residents from New Zealand, Prince Albert of Monaco, Dutchmen from the Netherlands Antillies, 2 pairs from Toronto representing Portugal, four middle aged sailers from the US Virgin Islands, four brothers from Mexico, coached by their dad and more. While the media focuses on the medal contenders, the Olympic Creed refers to the "taking part" that is what the Olympics are about. I never heard any racist comments at the time (as suggested in the movie), the only complaint was that the less serious teams interferred with the race for the medals that the top teams had spent years training for. Again, this was resolved by the seeding process used in subsequent Olympics.The Jamaicans were a media sensation, and while training and racing their 2-man bobsled, during the first week of the 1988 Olympics, they fundraised to buy a 4-man sled, which they were able to do. So the first time Dudley drove a 4-man was during Olympic training in the second week of the Olympics. A 4-man is actually easier to drive than a 2-man since the extra weight makes it more stable, on the other hand it is slower react and correct so most people learn to drive with the 2-man sleds.Driving a Bobsled: The runner blades are rounded but don't have edges like a skate, you don't want too much control, the fast way down is to float down the run like a log flume. A driver can only get enough grip to steer when the sled is in under the g-forces of the banked corners, there is no control in the straightaways. The driver steers the sled off the corner aiming for the next corner.A new driver has to gain experience (usually by crashing) how much and how quickly to control the height of the sled entering a corner, then let it run free, and fast. At the end of the corner a driver cranks his head to look for the exit, his hands squeeze the left or right steering ropes to guide the sled off the turn and into the next curve or straightaway. It is a frigid form of ballet, violent and breathtaking, always one tap of the wall away from disaster.When a sled enters a long turn, such as the Kreisel, it has time to misbehave, it wants to climb too high, then drop down too low, then climb back up at the end, that is know as "the wave". A big wave is beyond recovery, while the sled is climbing at the end of the curve, the banked corner becomes a straightaway and the g-forces that are holding you up on the ice wall disappear. This results, at best, in a hard collision with the exit wall, at worst the sled rolls over on it's side, especially the heavy 4-man sleds.If the driver doesn't control the sled height in the split second that it gets onto the Kreisel he knows he is going to have to "crank" the steering rope hard at the end of the corner to overcome the wave and get down off the corner by "taking the hit", losing time, but saving the sled. If that doesn't get the sled off the high exit, the sled rolls onto it's side, all the way to the bottom of the bobsled run. The driver and the unappreciative crew are left to duck their heads, hold on to the hand holds and reconsider their career choices. It is a bonding experience, builds or destroys the team spirit. Surprisingly, the crew usually supports the driver, it is a part of the sport, an accepted risk. There are crewmen who have crashed and crewmen who have not yet done so. The relief of getting your first crash over with and relatively intact outweighs living in fear of the unknown. Actually, it is worth doing at least once, no one can hear you scream, and you find out what burning fibreglass smells like. Surviving a crash makes you appreciate life and you have a story to tell at the bar, chicks dig scars! A driver who makes a regular habit of flipping sleds, eventually runs out of crew, and can turn his misfortunes into a coaching career.The Deadly Game: To be serious, the sport used to be more dangerous, with sleds disappearing over the top of the curves, and into trees. Since the 1960's we now have lips, like guardrails, at the top of the corners. An early version of the lip cost the life of one of the best drivers in the sport. The two greatest Italian drivers of the mid 20th Century were Eugenio Monti and Sergio Zardini. Zardini moved to Lake Placid in the 1960's. That old Lake Placid track had a left-right combination called zig-zag. On a bitter cold 1966 morning there were several crashes going from zig into zag by veterans of the Bobrun. Even Sergio Zardini's 4-man sled couldn't make it through, his sled wouldn't get off zig, the sled flipped into zag headfirst into the lip, which was built as a row of wood crossways boards instead of boards layed in the direction of sled travel. A photo of the moment shows that his helmet was torn loose on impact. His death was not a price that drivers should have been expected to pay to do this sport. Canadian Bob Storey was the brakeman and survived that ride and went on to drive in 2 Olympics and become President of the Canadian Bobsleigh Association. Safety gear and track design were eventually improved.Learning the art of 4-man: Dudley Stokes was in his first week of driving a 4-man, he drove two other 4-man sleds that week in Olympic training before buying the freshly painted race sled, a "crash course" in learning 4-man. The crew was also new to the sled and the push start, then the choreography involved in loading 4 large men into a moving sled.The Crash: When the Jamaican sled came out of curve 8 and rode the long straight towards the 270 degree left hand circle of the Kreisel corner, the driver was a bit late catching the sled. Watching video later I noticed that he had made the same mistake with the 2-man sled, but got away with it on the lighter sled. The 4-man climbed too high into the Kreisel, dipped in the middle, the momentum of the wave sent the sled up at the exit of the curve. They ran out of curve, lost all the centrifugal force that was holding them onto the banking, and rolled over onto the left side of their sled. They could only duck their heads and hold onto the handles tight through the violent ride through curves 10, 11, 12, 13 and the finish turn.Movie Version: In the movie, it portrays a loose nut causing the crash, that is another bit of lazy fiction created by the script writer (I have no respect for someone making up lies instead of doing his homework, when writing a story about real people!) The sled crashed due to driver error, Dudley Stokes was a talented athlete, he was a helicopter pilot in the Jamaican Defence Force, he went on to compete for years successfully.Brian Grant, 1988 US Virgin Islands coach and driver of the yellow sled in Cool Runnings (only seen in background shots).

Cool Runnings is phenomenal and John Candy is always brilliant.What I love about this film is its heart. Not too many films have heart these days, but this one definitely does.I also love the fish out of water context made funny and fresh.I think john Candy's character is wonderful. I have seen just about everything that he has done, and i have never been disappointed. I would love to see someone do a biography movie on his life, I would be interested in finding out what others think as to who should play him in a movie, I can not think of anyone off hand that would do him justice

This underdog sport movie is sure to touch you and lift your spirit. It's nearly a perfect family film. The film is loosely based on a series of true events of the first ever Olympic Jamaican Bobsled Team during the 1988's Calgary Winter Olympic Games. The movie by director Jon Turteltaub takes a lot of creative liberties in the story, recreate a movie infusing enough humor, heart and charm to make this story, very entertaining. The movie tells the story of four Jamaicans athletes, seeking a new way to make their country proud after failing the Olympic tryouts in track & field. All four, find the way in, through an ex-bobsledder named Irving Blitzer (John Candy) whom was banned from the sport, due to cheating. Now, living in shame, in Jamaica, Irving has become an alcoholic has-been. The team enlists his services to be their coach, and soon we find ourselves that maybe Team Jamaica might have a chance to make it to the Olympics, after all. The comedy was funny and enjoyable as each archetype character brings in a lovable trait in that makes it worth watching. First off, there is Derice Bannock (Leon) who dreamt of Olympic grander even if it's takes him losing his Jamaican identify by copying the Swiss team to do it. Then there is Junior Bevil (Rawle Lewis) whom lives under the strict watch of his wealthy father who doesn't wholeheartedly support his Olympic goals as a sub-plot. Third is Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) who lacks a good education but makes up for that with physical strength and macho attitude. He is often mistaken as a thug. Last person in the team is Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) whom may not be the best athlete of the four, but carries the most heart and pride in being Jamaican. The bobsledders portrayed in the film are fictional, but at less, the movie could had more realistic names for the four characters than naming one out of a pot of coffee, and an old Western actor. It's like naming a fast runner, Usain Bolt. Wait a minute, the last one is really his name. Haha. In the film, the team is formed by Jamaican sprinters after failing to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics. In real life, the Jamaican Summer Olympic Trials would have occurred following the Winter Olympics in Calgary. Irving "Irv" Blitzer is a fictional character as well; the real team had several trainers, none of whom were connected to any cheating scandal. In the sport of bobsledding, adding weight to the sled is perfectly legal. Both two and four-man sleds have minimum and maximum weights. As of this writing, the character of Irving Blitzer did nothing wrong. John Candy is amazing in the role, and it's sad that he died so soon after this movie. The villains of the film, if you can call them 'villains' are the East German team lead by arrogant leader, Josef (Peter Outerbridge) who treat the Jamaicans with serious scrutiny. Like the cartoony Jamaican stereotypes, the East German portrayal in the film are just outlandish racist. The only thing missing is the pencil thin mustaches for them. In real life, the East German team was very supported to the Jamaican bobsled team. There were somewhat true things about the film that worth noting. They did indeed turned up in Calgary without a sled. The nightclub fight didn't happen, but they almost start a riot there, when their singer got carried away and tried to sing a country song during a fund raiser for the sled. They were disqualified by the Olympic committee, but able to gain appeal. It was because the lack of training and whole thing about not having a sled. Not because cheating. Without spoiling too much of the ending, the events that happen are way different than that in real life, but the crash footage was the real life footage shot that day in 1988. The movie is so sport clichés that it's predictable to watch. The slow-building standing ovation is an example of this cheese formula. The film's depiction of such bobsledders carrying the sled over the line on their shoulders for dramatic effect works. This film in a masterful way shows that what matters is not always the victory but just being there and participating. Throughout the course of the movie we see the team prove to the world through their persistence that they are just as good as any other team, regardless of where they come from. They learn to become a team, learn to take pride in their culture, and do a lot of self-discovery. Even if the film itself, verges on being a bit mushy. Great morals that children will pick up on. There is some mild use of profanity, and few violent, but for the most part, it's worth watching with your children. The humor works, and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to support the mood of the movie. While the film was made by Americans. I think Jamaicans can find this movie, interesting to watch. Without this film; there wouldn't be much of a Jamaican bobsled program. The Jamaican national bobsled team still represents Jamaica in international bobsledding competitions even today. One of the original bobsled team member even won a Gold Medal in the Olympic in 2006 for Canada. International fans would love it for its Olympic source material, and the use of supporting your culture. So ya mon, it's a good movie!

Cool Runnings is a lighthearted and somewhat slapstick depiction of a fairly fascinating true story. It may be excessively sentimental and rather clumsy in its portrayal of Jamaicans but the movie is wholly enjoyable if you don't take it to seriously.

Cool runnings holds up with its beautiful cinematography, lovable characters, and solid humor It does not hold up with its' sports movie cliches and it's predictability. Nevertheless, I will remember the former than the latter.

I have seen this movie at least 7 times and still get the greatest laugh from it. It has humor, sense of competition to win the big event with all their hearts. Just good clean overall fun and great story line which I understand was derived from a true story.

I'm not normally a big fan of family films at all. Honestly I hate most of them. I find them boring and often corny. There's nothing in them for me. COOL RUNNINGS is the exception. It's a great movie, hands down. It's funny and entertaining, and the acting and story are both great.It even holds up well against other great films from all genres and eras. Sure, it's clean fun for the family to enjoy, but it's also the type of film that single adults can watch and love, or anyone else for that matter. John Candy is great in this, as is the rest of the cast. Recommend.

'Cool Runnings' is one of those prized and rare animals - a genuinely feel-good family movie that doesn't also make you feel stupid.Based (rather loosely, I suspect) on the true story of the Jamaican bobsled team who competed in the Winter Olympics, against outrageous odds, ridicule, complete lack of snow in Jamaica, etc, etc - 'Cool Runnings' hardly puts a foot wrong as it moves towards its rousing ending. That ending is genuinely inspirational, lump-in-the-throat stuff, which so many serious sports movies have aimed at, and fallen short of.Most miraculously, from my point of view, I actually found myself _liking_ John Candy, in this movie. I'm giving this one 8 out of 10. It achieves its goals splendidly. Be sure to give it a look if you've not seen it before.

In one of John Candy last films and one I somehow missed to watch when released in 1993/94 (there was great hype surrounding it) it is certainly not one to be taken seriously but I can't recall a Candy movie that does.It is very loosely based on the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the Winter Olympics in 1988 and nowhere near a biography. In fact almost everything is fictional. And that's what makes it more fun.Candy stars a disgraced former bobsleigh gold medalist (now a bookie) tasked to coach a top 100m sprinter (Leon Robinson) and his motley crew to become the Jamaican representatives at the bobsleigh races at the Winter Olympics in Canada despite having inexperience in snowy weather.Hence all daft. childish and sometimes predictable mishaps on the way but never failing to raise a smile. All characters are likable and all the stereotypes are there: the intelligent one, the hard man, the wimp and the fool.Good cheesy family fun and that it is intended to be.

I think cool runnings is a fantastic movie, since this movie was made in 1993, i have grown up with this movie because i enjoyed what i saw that was put into the movie and i thought it was fantastic, the way the actors were with the characters, playing them perfect. My heart goes to John Candy as i heard years ago that he passed away and died froma heart attack. He was such a great actor and had so many fans, besides him doing a great performance in cool runnings, my other favourite movies with him in it have got to be Splash, Home Alone, Uncle Buck, i think those movies are fanastic, the great movies of the 1980's and 1990's i feel as though that these are the favourites for those who liked this movies. I give cool runnings 10 out of 10 because i think it is fantastic. God bless you John and thank you for the great performances you made in the movies you starred in.

Hands up all Jamaicans.  (There are only 2.6 million people in Jamaica - so I know you don't account for a large percentage of the English-speaking world.)  Hands up all those people with any interest at all in bobsledding. Hah!  I knew it!  No-one.That's why `Cool Runnings' succeeds.  It depends not at all on aggressive nationalism (it couldn't afford to, with a constituency of 2.6 million), and people of all countries are free to participate in the Jamaicans' perfectly reasonable patriotism.  (Probably even the Swiss, whose bobsled team comes across as more than a trifle arrogant.)  Nor is there any of that worship of a particular sport that makes baseball movies so unendurable for people outside of North America, Cuba and Japan.  (Not that I have any evidence that baseball movies are popular in Cuba or Japan.)There isn't any power-of-positive-thinking psychobabble, either - at least, it doesn't dominate.  The four Jamaican bobsledders are separate people with different goals and ways of thinking.  The coach (played beautifully by John Candy, who proves that he can act without playing the clown) doesn't ram a particular ideology down his players' throats.  I doubt that any sports film has a more civilised and reasonable coach.It comes down to this: we are given a reason to care about the characters, unrelated to nationality; and we are given a story that's worth following, even if we would never follow the sport itself.  The clichés are fewer than usual and never offensive.  It's a sweet film, and I doubt there's more than a handfull of people who could resist its charm.

It's probably a word game that has been used many times before, but "Cool Runnings" is a very 'cool' movie that offered me a lot of fun and laughter. And since this is a comedy and not a documentary, that's all I'm asking of this movie.If you hope to see a documentary on how the first Jamaican bobsled team was created and how they got to the Olympics than you'll have to look for something else. This movie has been inspired on the true events, but never pretends to be faithful to the truth. Does that mean that this movie isn't any good? No, certainly not. I loved to see how these four guys were transfered from sprinters to bobsledders and I couldn't help laughing all the time when seeing their reactions on, for instance, the cold and the snow.This isn't the greatest movie ever and yes it is full of clichés, but they all work and it never bothered me once. However, don't expect to see a ridiculous comedy with no content either, because it still has a good story and plenty of emotions and excitement to offer. I reward this movie with an 8/10.

One of John Candy's best movies.  An excellent cast makes this a real feel good film telling the story of the first Jamaican bobsled team and their efforts to overcome the prejudices of a previous all white sport.  You'll enjoy every minute of this flick and have a better understanding of what it takes to join the Olympic movement.  For the entire family.

Make no mistake, Cool Runnings is not the true story of the Jamaican Bobsled team.  It is inspired by it, but this is not a documentary.  Still, despite that, it does capture the spirit of the team and the derision they faced. In a fun and entertaining way, the filmmakers displayed the true lesson of the team:  if you have a dream, go after it, no matter what anyone else says.This isn't the greatest film ever and it's full of cliches; but, they work. If you can't get caught up in the emotion and excitement of the film, it's because your heart is frozen.  There are plenty of laughs and general silliness, but there is also good drama and fine performances.  John Candy showed he could deliver an emotional performance instead of just schtick. During the bobsled runs, you can't help but find yourself cheering for the team.This film is a pleasure to watch and will bring a smile to your face.  Is it good?  Yeah, mon!

This one of those family-oriented sports movies that I have fond memories of from my elementary school days. Off the top of my head, I can name The Air Up There, Iron Will, and the Mighty Ducks in this category as well. They weren't masterpieces, per se, but they were pleasant, fun, and sometimes inspirational. The thing about a sports movie is that the passion that a dedicated athlete feels is usually something that can translate itself visually on screen. For instance, if you were to make a movie about a passionate chess player, it's not as exciting to watch the final climactic moment when the hero checkmates his opponent, as it is to watch a game winning shot. What I'm getting to is that one of the draws of a sports movie is being exposed to that passion and desire in our hero. In this case, the hero is Jamaican sprinter Derice Bannock who was accidentally tripped during the Olympic trials, but is determined to make the Olympics anyway. Since track's no longer an option for him, he figures why not start the nation's first bobsledding team, since a bobsled team hasn't been fielded yet. He also is encouraged in the sport by the fact that a friend of his dad happens to be a bobsled coach and he might be able to help. The bobsled coach declines citing as his reasons that there's no ice in Jamaica, that there's not enough time to train, that Derice doesn't have 3 other people which is needed to form a team, that he doesn't even think Derice was a good runner, and that he doesn't even like coaching anymore.Nevertheless, Derice manages to convince the coach, and get three teammates consisting of his best friend, the guy who tripped him in the trials, and another sprinter who got tripped in the trials along with him. This is one of the better sources of entertainment in the film because the dynamics of this team are formed under such unusual circumstance. For instance, Yul, one of the two who got tripped during the trials, still hasn't forgiven Junior, the tripper.The film very cleverly finds a balance between the inspirational element of this story and the humor. Essentially, Derice the most determined member of the group, is a person who we come to admire for his persistence, and maybe that's why it's a good family film, someone kids can look up to. The humor comes from Derice's friend, Sanka, who says a lot of funny stuff. This really is the only way the movie could work because if Derice was funny and told jokes, you wouldn't take him seriously, and if Sanka was more determined about winning, his jokes would sound out of context. The two guys in the middle of the bobsled, both metaphorically and literally, add to the film in their own ways but on a smaller scale. The late John Candy plays the coach and fills the part well. The other notable thing about the film is it's ending. Provided, this is your first viewing, it really does a lot for the movie. I won't give it away, but the ending is unpredictable yet equally satisfying, something I don't often see. However, I wonder, since this was filmed only five years after the Calgary Olympics, how familiar would viewers have been with the actual event that inspired the film. If they knew the story of the '88 Jamaican bobsled team in its entirety, than the impact of that ending would have been lost.

This entertaining movie, based on the true story of the Jamaican Bob Sled Team's (yes, you heard right - Jamaican Bob Sled Team) participation in the 1985 Winter Olympics is a funny film with a warm heart that moves to an inspiring ending. The story, about a group of Jamaican athletes who were prevented from competing as runners and so sought a different (!) venue in order to participate, has many funny moments. The late John Candy, of whom I am no fan, is very good here; his role as the coach with a checkered past calls for some real dramatic work as well as comedy. The team is a very likeable bunch (with varying acting abilities) and the viewer is rooting for them all the way as they demonstrate great courage in snatching their own kind of victory from the jaws of defeat; the ending is a real lump-in-the-throater.Good flick, but a caveat for viewing with the kiddos - the language is a tad rough in a couple of spots.

It's 1987 Jamaica. Derice Bannock (Leon) fails to qualify for the Olympics 100-metre dash in Seoul when Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) falls and trips him and Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba). He is devastated and told to wait for another 4 years. He sees Irving Blitzer (John Candy) in an old photo with his father. Irv is a former medal winner friend of his father who is now a bookie living in Jamaica. He has the idea to start a Jamaican bobsled team with his bumbling push cart friend Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug). Along with rich boy Junior, angry Yul, and Irv, they head to the Calgary Winter Olympics. This is simply a fun movie. It's mostly due to the characters and the actors. Doug E. Doug delivers the light hearted humor. There's a real good-nature charm to this movie. It follows a familiar formula.

I remember watching this movie when I was a kid and loving it. It is one of those feel good movies that you think is corny but somehow avoids that label. The characters are funny and endearing. John Candy balances the broken side of his character along with the inspirational side of his character very believably. Doug E Doug has some hilarious dialogs. You feel yourself rooting for the team with more feeling than you expect. The director does well by not focusing on the racial aspect of the movie and converting it to just another movie of black vs. white. Obviously you cannot expect any brilliant acting or movie making but all in all this movie is a must see for families. Four Jamaicans in a bob sled is more entertaining than it looks.

When I saw "Cool Runnings" the first time, I mostly cracked up at the line about drawing a line down the middle of Yul Brynner's head (cut me some slack; I was nine years old). Nowadays, I understand that the movie did focus on a real story and so at least had that value. While it was silly at times and did try to pull at emotions at times, I still consider it a pretty admirable movie. John Candy (who would have turned 57 today) plays one of his slightly more serious roles as the Jamaican bobsled team's manager; I always say that these movies show what we lost when he died. But among other things, I just like to see Jamaica. I mean, the country that gave us calypso and reggae also had a bobsled team! All in all, a pretty good movie.

Just saw this movie again on HBO, haven't seen it in almost a decade, and was surprised at how much slipped by me the first time. It's only sad point is to be reminded of what a loss we movie lovers suffered with the death of John Candy. Imagine what he could have done with a little more time on this mortal coil. This movie is uplifting; it's about the human spirit, its strengths and weaknesses. It explores the parent-child conflict, superstition, ambition, love, hate, patriotism and a gamut of other themes. The story telling is good, the camaraderie authentic, and the celebration of life inspiring. Follow your dreams, wherever they may lead you. When things seem impossible, just remember that there's a Jamaican bobsled team.

When the Jamaican sprinter Derice Bannock (Leon) is disqualified to the Olympic Games due to a silly accident, he envision the chance to participate in bobsleigh modality. He meets the dishonored couch Irving Blitzer (John Candy), who is living in the tropical country after two gold medals and elimination due to cheating, and convinces him to couch the first Jamaican Bobsled Team. They form a group with the push-cart driver Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug), the sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) and the rich Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) and without any sponsor, fly to Calgary, Alberta, Canada to participate of the XV Olympic Winter Games at -25o C. In the end, they become winners without winning the game.Based on the true surprising participation of Jamaica in the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in the winter sport known as bobsleigh, or bobsled, in which teams make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sled, this comedy gives a very important message: the importance of teamwork and objective to make winners. Therefore, "Cool Runnings" is a great entertainment for audiences of any age. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Jamaica Abaixo de Zero" ("Jamaica below Zero")

It might not be historically accurate - and you know what, some of the best films aren't - but I believe, hand on heart, that Cool Runnings is one of greatest films ever made.Cool Runnings is absolutely hilarious with a wonderful blend of slapstick comedy, one liners, colourful characters and absurdity, however its comic achievements are well documented, and for this reason I will take them as read.Cool Runnings is an exploration of a number of the weightiest themes a film can deal with, such as racism, poverty, pride, passion, forgiveness and self-belief. Cool Runnings tackles all of these themes head-on without losing an ounce of its charm, humour, or family-fun.A superbly played Joseph Gruel is the prime embodiment of the racism the Jamaicans face on the hill, and his story is very moving. So too is the voyage of self-discovery and forgiveness embarked on by disgraced coach Erv Blitzer (John Candy). The team themselves are a wonderful advert for teamwork and the little island of Jamaica. Each one is wise, bold in the face of their respective adversity, and has an intriguing story to tell.The ending of Cool Runnings also ranks as one of the greatest. It masterfully avoids the back-slapping, one-dimensional and predictable ending it looks to be approaching, a trap that so many other similar 'feel-good' films fall into. Instead Cool Runnings brings together all of the themes that have been explored, in one emotionally charged final scene.99% will disagree with something I have written above. But I first watched the film 15 years ago and it has stayed with me ever since. I have watched it around 100 times now, and I still shed a tear at the end...no other film has ever brought me even close to that.If you take nothing else from this review. Watch Cool Runnings. It is so much better than the clever-arsed, blockbuster-biased critics will have you believe. Forget the highly forgettable cheese like Remember the Titans, The Mighty Ducks and all the rest. Pull up a chair, get the phone on divert, and sit back and enjoy the only 'feel good' film worth watching.

The screenplay is intelligent, focused and clever. I much enjoyed this film, mostly because of the convincing characters. I am aware of much of the criticism around this movie, claiming it is bad and not worth seeing. To all those who have said these things, I have to ask: What film were you watching? With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from 1993. I laughed and was moved and all of that good stuff. At the end of the day, it's a fun, entertaining film. Wonderful movie, and I should know, I practically grew up on it. An excellent and difficult production, bolstered by great performances.

This movie was loosely based on a true story. Specifically there was a 4-man bobsled team from Jamaica that competed in the Calgary Olympics, and they crashed the sled. Everything else in the movie was fiction, written by a lazy screenwriter with no research. They deserved better than this farce. I rated this as a 5 of 10, because the writers could have at least tried to tell the true story! Too bad, they didn't even care.The 1988 Calgary Olympics were the last of the "open era" of Olympic bobsledding. There were 41 sleds in the 2-man race, and 26 sleds in the 4-man race. The problem was that medals were decided by hundredths of a second and every 1400 pound sled under 2-3 gforce in the banked corners damaged the smooth ice. The 10 or so medal contending sleds all faced different ice conditions over the 4 runs of the 2 day race. Complaints from the elite teams finally forced the FIBT to introduce seeding, like ski racing had, and stronger entry standards (a minimum number of World Cup races in order to compete at the Olympics). True to the Olympic ideals the "youth" of the World could still compete, but the top teams in World Cup would go down first in each heat.At the Calgary Olympics the medals were won by East Germans, Swiss (Gold in 4-man) and the (Latvian) Soviet Union, grabbing Gold with their skinny 2-man sled, in their second Olympics in bobsledding. The Jamaican driver, Dudley Stokes with Michael White finished the 2-man race in 30th. They were good athletes, but lacked in driving experience. The crash in the 4-man race put them in last, but heroes forever! Eight years later they were ready, at the1994 Olympics the Jamaicans finished 14th in 4-man, ahead of the USA team!In Calgary there were bobsledders from Taiwan, Australia, Calgary residents from New Zealand, Prince Albert of Monaco, Dutchmen from the Netherlands Antillies, 2 pairs from Toronto representing Portugal, four middle aged sailers from the US Virgin Islands, four brothers from Mexico, coached by their dad and more. While the media focuses on the medal contenders, the Olympic Creed refers to the "taking part" that is what the Olympics are about. I never heard any racist comments at the time (as suggested in the movie), the only complaint was that the less serious teams interferred with the race for the medals that the top teams had spent years training for. Again, this was resolved by the seeding process used in subsequent Olympics.The Jamaicans were a media sensation, and while training and racing their 2-man bobsled, during the first week of the 1988 Olympics, they fundraised to buy a 4-man sled, which they were able to do. So the first time Dudley drove a 4-man was during Olympic training in the second week of the Olympics. A 4-man is actually easier to drive than a 2-man since the extra weight makes it more stable, on the other hand it is slower react and correct so most people learn to drive with the 2-man sleds.Driving a Bobsled: The runner blades are rounded but don't have edges like a skate, you don't want too much control, the fast way down is to float down the run like a log flume. A driver can only get enough grip to steer when the sled is in under the g-forces of the banked corners, there is no control in the straightaways. The driver steers the sled off the corner aiming for the next corner.A new driver has to gain experience (usually by crashing) how much and how quickly to control the height of the sled entering a corner, then let it run free, and fast. At the end of the corner a driver cranks his head to look for the exit, his hands squeeze the left or right steering ropes to guide the sled off the turn and into the next curve or straightaway. It is a frigid form of ballet, violent and breathtaking, always one tap of the wall away from disaster.When a sled enters a long turn, such as the Kreisel, it has time to misbehave, it wants to climb too high, then drop down too low, then climb back up at the end, that is know as "the wave". A big wave is beyond recovery, while the sled is climbing at the end of the curve, the banked corner becomes a straightaway and the g-forces that are holding you up on the ice wall disappear. This results, at best, in a hard collision with the exit wall, at worst the sled rolls over on it's side, especially the heavy 4-man sleds.If the driver doesn't control the sled height in the split second that it gets onto the Kreisel he knows he is going to have to "crank" the steering rope hard at the end of the corner to overcome the wave and get down off the corner by "taking the hit", losing time, but saving the sled. If that doesn't get the sled off the high exit, the sled rolls onto it's side, all the way to the bottom of the bobsled run. The driver and the unappreciative crew are left to duck their heads, hold on to the hand holds and reconsider their career choices. It is a bonding experience, builds or destroys the team spirit. Surprisingly, the crew usually supports the driver, it is a part of the sport, an accepted risk. There are crewmen who have crashed and crewmen who have not yet done so. The relief of getting your first crash over with and relatively intact outweighs living in fear of the unknown. Actually, it is worth doing at least once, no one can hear you scream, and you find out what burning fibreglass smells like. Surviving a crash makes you appreciate life and you have a story to tell at the bar, chicks dig scars! A driver who makes a regular habit of flipping sleds, eventually runs out of crew, and can turn his misfortunes into a coaching career.The Deadly Game: To be serious, the sport used to be more dangerous, with sleds disappearing over the top of the curves, and into trees. Since the 1960's we now have lips, like guardrails, at the top of the corners. An early version of the lip cost the life of one of the best drivers in the sport. The two greatest Italian drivers of the mid 20th Century were Eugenio Monti and Sergio Zardini. Zardini moved to Lake Placid in the 1960's. That old Lake Placid track had a left-right combination called zig-zag. On a bitter cold 1966 morning there were several crashes going from zig into zag by veterans of the Bobrun. Even Sergio Zardini's 4-man sled couldn't make it through, his sled wouldn't get off zig, the sled flipped into zag headfirst into the lip, which was built as a row of wood crossways boards instead of boards layed in the direction of sled travel. A photo of the moment shows that his helmet was torn loose on impact. His death was not a price that drivers should have been expected to pay to do this sport. Canadian Bob Storey was the brakeman and survived that ride and went on to drive in 2 Olympics and become President of the Canadian Bobsleigh Association. Safety gear and track design were eventually improved.Learning the art of 4-man: Dudley Stokes was in his first week of driving a 4-man, he drove two other 4-man sleds that week in Olympic training before buying the freshly painted race sled, a "crash course" in learning 4-man. The crew was also new to the sled and the push start, then the choreography involved in loading 4 large men into a moving sled.The Crash: When the Jamaican sled came out of curve 8 and rode the long straight towards the 270 degree left hand circle of the Kreisel corner, the driver was a bit late catching the sled. Watching video later I noticed that he had made the same mistake with the 2-man sled, but got away with it on the lighter sled. The 4-man climbed too high into the Kreisel, dipped in the middle, the momentum of the wave sent the sled up at the exit of the curve. They ran out of curve, lost all the centrifugal force that was holding them onto the banking, and rolled over onto the left side of their sled. They could only duck their heads and hold onto the handles tight through the violent ride through curves 10, 11, 12, 13 and the finish turn.Movie Version: In the movie, it portrays a loose nut causing the crash, that is another bit of lazy fiction created by the script writer (I have no respect for someone making up lies instead of doing his homework, when writing a story about real people!) The sled crashed due to driver error, Dudley Stokes was a talented athlete, he was a helicopter pilot in the Jamaican Defence Force, he went on to compete for years successfully.Brian Grant, 1988 US Virgin Islands coach and driver of the yellow sled in Cool Runnings (only seen in background shots).

Cool Runnings is phenomenal and John Candy is always brilliant.What I love about this film is its heart. Not too many films have heart these days, but this one definitely does.I also love the fish out of water context made funny and fresh.I think john Candy's character is wonderful. I have seen just about everything that he has done, and i have never been disappointed. I would love to see someone do a biography movie on his life, I would be interested in finding out what others think as to who should play him in a movie, I can not think of anyone off hand that would do him justice

This underdog sport movie is sure to touch you and lift your spirit. It's nearly a perfect family film. The film is loosely based on a series of true events of the first ever Olympic Jamaican Bobsled Team during the 1988's Calgary Winter Olympic Games. The movie by director Jon Turteltaub takes a lot of creative liberties in the story, recreate a movie infusing enough humor, heart and charm to make this story, very entertaining. The movie tells the story of four Jamaicans athletes, seeking a new way to make their country proud after failing the Olympic tryouts in track & field. All four, find the way in, through an ex-bobsledder named Irving Blitzer (John Candy) whom was banned from the sport, due to cheating. Now, living in shame, in Jamaica, Irving has become an alcoholic has-been. The team enlists his services to be their coach, and soon we find ourselves that maybe Team Jamaica might have a chance to make it to the Olympics, after all. The comedy was funny and enjoyable as each archetype character brings in a lovable trait in that makes it worth watching. First off, there is Derice Bannock (Leon) who dreamt of Olympic grander even if it's takes him losing his Jamaican identify by copying the Swiss team to do it. Then there is Junior Bevil (Rawle Lewis) whom lives under the strict watch of his wealthy father who doesn't wholeheartedly support his Olympic goals as a sub-plot. Third is Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) who lacks a good education but makes up for that with physical strength and macho attitude. He is often mistaken as a thug. Last person in the team is Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) whom may not be the best athlete of the four, but carries the most heart and pride in being Jamaican. The bobsledders portrayed in the film are fictional, but at less, the movie could had more realistic names for the four characters than naming one out of a pot of coffee, and an old Western actor. It's like naming a fast runner, Usain Bolt. Wait a minute, the last one is really his name. Haha. In the film, the team is formed by Jamaican sprinters after failing to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics. In real life, the Jamaican Summer Olympic Trials would have occurred following the Winter Olympics in Calgary. Irving "Irv" Blitzer is a fictional character as well; the real team had several trainers, none of whom were connected to any cheating scandal. In the sport of bobsledding, adding weight to the sled is perfectly legal. Both two and four-man sleds have minimum and maximum weights. As of this writing, the character of Irving Blitzer did nothing wrong. John Candy is amazing in the role, and it's sad that he died so soon after this movie. The villains of the film, if you can call them 'villains' are the East German team lead by arrogant leader, Josef (Peter Outerbridge) who treat the Jamaicans with serious scrutiny. Like the cartoony Jamaican stereotypes, the East German portrayal in the film are just outlandish racist. The only thing missing is the pencil thin mustaches for them. In real life, the East German team was very supported to the Jamaican bobsled team. There were somewhat true things about the film that worth noting. They did indeed turned up in Calgary without a sled. The nightclub fight didn't happen, but they almost start a riot there, when their singer got carried away and tried to sing a country song during a fund raiser for the sled. They were disqualified by the Olympic committee, but able to gain appeal. It was because the lack of training and whole thing about not having a sled. Not because cheating. Without spoiling too much of the ending, the events that happen are way different than that in real life, but the crash footage was the real life footage shot that day in 1988. The movie is so sport clichés that it's predictable to watch. The slow-building standing ovation is an example of this cheese formula. The film's depiction of such bobsledders carrying the sled over the line on their shoulders for dramatic effect works. This film in a masterful way shows that what matters is not always the victory but just being there and participating. Throughout the course of the movie we see the team prove to the world through their persistence that they are just as good as any other team, regardless of where they come from. They learn to become a team, learn to take pride in their culture, and do a lot of self-discovery. Even if the film itself, verges on being a bit mushy. Great morals that children will pick up on. There is some mild use of profanity, and few violent, but for the most part, it's worth watching with your children. The humor works, and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to support the mood of the movie. While the film was made by Americans. I think Jamaicans can find this movie, interesting to watch. Without this film; there wouldn't be much of a Jamaican bobsled program. The Jamaican national bobsled team still represents Jamaica in international bobsledding competitions even today. One of the original bobsled team member even won a Gold Medal in the Olympic in 2006 for Canada. International fans would love it for its Olympic source material, and the use of supporting your culture. So ya mon, it's a good movie!

Cool runnings holds up with its beautiful cinematography, lovable characters, and solid humor It does not hold up with its' sports movie cliches and it's predictability. Nevertheless, I will remember the former than the latter.

Cool Runnings is a lighthearted and somewhat slapstick depiction of a fairly fascinating true story. It may be excessively sentimental and rather clumsy in its portrayal of Jamaicans but the movie is wholly enjoyable if you don't take it to seriously.

I have seen this movie at least 7 times and still get the greatest laugh from it. It has humor, sense of competition to win the big event with all their hearts. Just good clean overall fun and great story line which I understand was derived from a true story.

I'm not normally a big fan of family films at all. Honestly I hate most of them. I find them boring and often corny. There's nothing in them for me. COOL RUNNINGS is the exception. It's a great movie, hands down. It's funny and entertaining, and the acting and story are both great.It even holds up well against other great films from all genres and eras. Sure, it's clean fun for the family to enjoy, but it's also the type of film that single adults can watch and love, or anyone else for that matter. John Candy is great in this, as is the rest of the cast. Recommend.

'Cool Runnings' is one of those prized and rare animals - a genuinely feel-good family movie that doesn't also make you feel stupid.Based (rather loosely, I suspect) on the true story of the Jamaican bobsled team who competed in the Winter Olympics, against outrageous odds, ridicule, complete lack of snow in Jamaica, etc, etc - 'Cool Runnings' hardly puts a foot wrong as it moves towards its rousing ending. That ending is genuinely inspirational, lump-in-the-throat stuff, which so many serious sports movies have aimed at, and fallen short of.Most miraculously, from my point of view, I actually found myself _liking_ John Candy, in this movie. I'm giving this one 8 out of 10. It achieves its goals splendidly. Be sure to give it a look if you've not seen it before.

In one of John Candy last films and one I somehow missed to watch when released in 1993/94 (there was great hype surrounding it) it is certainly not one to be taken seriously but I can't recall a Candy movie that does.It is very loosely based on the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the Winter Olympics in 1988 and nowhere near a biography. In fact almost everything is fictional. And that's what makes it more fun.Candy stars a disgraced former bobsleigh gold medalist (now a bookie) tasked to coach a top 100m sprinter (Leon Robinson) and his motley crew to become the Jamaican representatives at the bobsleigh races at the Winter Olympics in Canada despite having inexperience in snowy weather.Hence all daft. childish and sometimes predictable mishaps on the way but never failing to raise a smile. All characters are likable and all the stereotypes are there: the intelligent one, the hard man, the wimp and the fool.Good cheesy family fun and that it is intended to be.

I think cool runnings is a fantastic movie, since this movie was made in 1993, i have grown up with this movie because i enjoyed what i saw that was put into the movie and i thought it was fantastic, the way the actors were with the characters, playing them perfect. My heart goes to John Candy as i heard years ago that he passed away and died froma heart attack. He was such a great actor and had so many fans, besides him doing a great performance in cool runnings, my other favourite movies with him in it have got to be Splash, Home Alone, Uncle Buck, i think those movies are fanastic, the great movies of the 1980's and 1990's i feel as though that these are the favourites for those who liked this movies. I give cool runnings 10 out of 10 because i think it is fantastic. God bless you John and thank you for the great performances you made in the movies you starred in.

One of those great movies that just gets better with each viewing. I remember watching it as a kid and loving it! Now that I have my own kids, they have a blast watching it too! I especially like how inspirational the message is. There are so many reasons why the team shouldn't be able to succeed, but they still manage to in their own special way.

It would be nice if they remade this into a accurate movie, with actual Jamaican actors...
But anyway, cult classic cheesiness if you understand that its a dumb Disney retelling of something that happened.
Doesn't age very well at all, but John Candy used to great, huh?
