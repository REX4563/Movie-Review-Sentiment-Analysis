Many action flicks over the years have been called loud and dumb. This is no exception. The "Lethal Weapon" series has never been especially noted for its intellect but it has something that a lot of action films lack: heart. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's winning chemistry created some of the most tender moments in the series and "Lethal Weapon 2" excels because they make the audience care about their characters. This movie is by far the best in the series with tones of moments registering directly to the viewer. Gibson and Glover provide these characters with depth that could easily have been lacking and the ending of this film leaves the audience actually feeling the love these two men have for each other. And, as a bonus, "Lethal Weapon 2" digs even deeper into one of the protagonist's past, shedding even more light as to why he is the way he is.

In keeping up the tradition of the original "Lethal Weapon", the sequel still continues the time-honoured tradition to providing the the action, the humour, and the thrills that made "Lethal Weapon I" one of the best buddy-cop movies in the history of cinema. The chemistry between Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover)is still remarkable. The only thing now is that Riggs is less self-destructive as he was in the first movie, but I guess it's so that in the first he tries to get over the loss of his wife and he somehow has moved on. Not as exciting as the first, but still very believable. Some historical-political elements that provides some surprising educational facts are delivered here in the movie that's obscurely mentioned in classrooms. Here it takes aim the the South African apartheid fiasco that ran from 1948, up until 1994 by Nelson Mandela who over-turned the government and became President of South Africa putting a stop to apartheid. During it's dying stages, the government provided segregated communities to it diverse ethnics and tried to promote theocracy. The South Africans depicted may have been over the top, but the political upheaval was executed immaculately. In spite of that cultural reference, there's a setback to it as well. I don't understand why did the South Africans killed Riggs' wife and now have targeted his girlfriend. What's up with that? The whole logic was completely null and void and has no logic to it at all. Some editing should have been taken to consideration. It's still an enjoyable film, but the first one stands above them all.

Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take the second sequel of a buddy cop action movie in the "Lethal Weapon" series, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) is one of the greatest action films of all time! Mel Gibson's performance as sergeant Martin Riggs is fantastic as well. This is a great must see movie! Martin Riggs becomes a bad ass in this movie, when his woman is killed. And also the movie gives more back story on how Riggs wife died from the first movie. I love this sequel but I have always enjoyed Lethal Weapon 3 much more than I did have enjoyed this one, but still a good awesome flick. I an a lot of opinions it is better than 3 & 4. It is my third favorite sequel in Lethal Weapon trilogy and I have enjoy Lethal Weapon 3 much more than I did 2. I love this sequel the same that I love 1 and 3, but 2 is one grade lover for me than 1 & 3.In the year of the Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 brought back Riggs and Murtaugh for the summer of '89. Man what a jammed packed summer that was. Lethal Weapon 2 lost it's darker tone but amped up the action elements and tossed in Joe Pesci (who was lost in cinema oblivion) until his turn in this movie, plus my cousin Vinny and eventually Home Alone and Goodfellas. His performance as Leo Getz introduces the comic relief that would go on through the next two movies. Lethal Weapon 2 offers up a fun ride with old friends an deeps the trust we have with Mel and Danny. They truly make a great cinematic team. Lethal Weapon 2 is the second installment in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover returns as Detectives Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, who find themselves assigned to protect an accountant (Joe Pesci) whose testimony involves a large money laundering conspiracy that involves South African diplomats during the time of apartheid.Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Patsy Kensit, Joss Ackland, Jenette Goldstein, Derrick O'Connor and Dean Norris did a terrific outstanding job portraying their characters. In the first movie there were drug smugglers, former Vietnam vets of a Shadow Company, this time they are South African diplomats who are smuggling drugs, weapons and gold coins from South Africa. I love the opening scenes that are in the middle of a car chase through the 4th Street tunnel in downtown Los Angeles. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), partners in the LAPD's homicide division, are in pursuit of a red BMW, while their colleagues are converging on the car from the opposite direction. It's a suspected drug bust. Riggs kicks it open and hundreds of South African krugerrands (gold coins which were illegal in the U. S. at the time due to the South African apartheid government), come spilling out. Murtaugh and Riggs head for the docks in search of the cargo ship, the Alba Varden. Murtaugh tells Riggs that it's scheduled to sail for South Africa. They find the ship and see three men standing near a container waiting to be loaded onto the ship. They ambush the men and take their weapons, then break into the container to investigate. Inside, they find Rudd's Mercedes sedan and numerous pallets piled high in shrink wrapped United States currency, in multiple denominations.The last showdown in the docks on the ship was pure action scenes and action sequences. The gun play was delivered with a lot of weapons. There was a lot of action scenes. (At one point Riggs fires his Beretta 92FS at an attacking helicopter and kills one of the henchman's.) Riggs (Mel Gibson) fires back at Rudd's henchmen atop his mobile home with a Heckler & Koch MP5A3. I have enjoyed the second movie a lot and the action sequences I still love this movie, I always love watching it and I just love all Lethal Weapons movies. I am giving this movie a 9 tough I gave Lethal Weapon 1 & 3 a 10, this movie deserves a 9, because I didn't like the scene "It's just been revoked!" Closeup of Murtaugh's Smith & Wesson Model 19 the moment before Murtaugh fires on Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland)in the head, when his gun was empty and the guy shows his South African diplomatic I. D. I don't like that scene and I think what Murtaugh did was just wrong in my opinion I am sorry. I am wondering what happened too Patsy Kensit? I have never seen her any other film role or on any other movie anymore.Lethal Weapon 2 is a 1989 American buddy cop action film directed by Richard Donner, and starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci , Patsy Kensit, Derrick O'Connor and Joss Ackland. It is a sequel to the 1987 film Lethal Weapon and second installment in the Lethal Weapon series.9/10 Grade: A- Studio: Warner Bros. Pictures, Silver Pictures Starring: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Joss Ackland, Derrick O'Connor, Patsy Kensit Director: Richard Donner Producers: Richard Donner, Joel Silver Screenplay: Jeffrey Boam Story: Shane Black, Warren Murphy Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 54 Mins. Budget: $25 Million Box Office: $227,853,986.

A worthy sequel. In fact, I think it's a bit of an improvement, with tighter plotting and more kinetic action sequences. I also liked, to my surprise, the addition of Joe Pesci as a witness Riggs and Murtaugh are protecting. Yes, he's more than a tad annoying, but he's annoying in a mostly funny way. I also very much liked Mel Gibson's love interest, played by the cute Brit Patsy Kensit, who unfortunately never made it very big. The sequence with the bomb attached to Murtaugh's toilet is classic, and the shot with the woman cop getting blown off her diving board is (unintentionally) hilarious. Also side-splitting: the aging henchman played by Derrick O'Connor, who becomes a master of kung fu whenever the shot gets dark enough for a stunt double to take his place.

The first one was hard core.  It was all about drugs, intrigue and Vietnam. It was also about Riggs' suicidal tendencies.  It was serious.  Too serious. That was awesome.  This one is about a lighter, gentler Riggs.  The same Murtaugh I'm afraid but a lighter gentler Riggs-for a while that is. Reasons why this film is better than the original:  1.  Leo Getz,  2.  Same chemistry but with a tighter bond,  3.  Comic relief,  4.  Truly despicable villains, 5.  Revenge story that pops out of nowhere really (this is quite surprising for a Gibson flick mind you).  This one's the best of the series. Part three was a joke.  Part four...I dunno what the hell that one was. Part one was pure setup baby.  This is the one.  >

Two years after having "shot Air America down" in LA, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh are cracking down on another fascist gang: White supremacist South-African Nazis who are drug dealers hiding behind diplomatic immunity. In this second episode, Martin finds a new love interest embodied by sweet and lovely Patsy Kensit A great antifacist and antiracist movie, and one of the best films of 1989 (a great year at the movies).

The first one had a completely fresh and enjoyable concept - What happens when you pair an older cop who has a family that he loves and who just wants to live to see retirement (Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh) with a younger cop who has nothing to lose after the death of his wife and seems to have a death wish himself (Mel Gibson as Martin Riggs)?So this film picks up where the first one left off, with Riggs still doing wild and crazy things, yet he now seems to want to live. He has also found a taste of family in his partner's wife and kids and spends lots of free time with them. To me those small scenes between Riggs and Martaugh's family are the best in the film.The film's villain was a favorite punching bag of the day - and rightfully so - apartheid enforcing South Africa. So unless you know something of how that country was run historically, this plot might not make much sense to you. The actual villain is Arjen Rudd, a South African diplomat and the corrupt Minister of Affairs for the South African consulate in Los Angeles. He uses diplomatic immunity to manage to do all kinds of illegal racketeering and murder in defense of that racketeering . Now this is not really how diplomatic immunity works. The first time the diplomat is arrested, the country of origin has a choice. If it cares about its reputation and thinks the charges are valid, that country could allow you to be charged in America. If they don't care or don't think that the charges are valid, you would be protected by diplomatic immunity that first time. But then the country in which you are serving - in this case America - could just kick you out in which you can kiss your criminal career goodbye. But if this happened then we would have no plot.I always thought the movie seemed disjointed, especially towards the end. Then I learned that it was originally intended that this would be the only sequel and so the script was changed multiple times, resulting in an ending that just didn't ring true to me. But it is still a pretty good action buddy flick.

Riggs and Murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated. The story line is just awful! I mean really, South African diplomats smuggling the mythical Krugerrands into the U.S. It's just painful! And the accents are absolutely abysmal! Can no one get an Afrikaans South African accent right? Or will we forever hear the British or Americans making them sound like drunken Hollanders? The only guy who got the Afrikaans accent right was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that i disliked was when Danny Glover so artlessly describes an Afrikaans accent as being shitty! I mean what a slap in the face to the Afrikaans. There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. I mean Mel Gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their P.A. type! Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film. If you want to see a film that doesn't completely insult a cultural group then rent Die Hard 2.

I must say that I enjoyed this one, though I was shocked, too. Now that I am older and I understand the nature of my country, to see a film focused so heavily on South African baddies pre the fall of Apartheid was heavy. Now, if you're from South Africa, just about any movies that refer back to our country way back in the day are bound to peeve you. They are usually stacked full of white guilt and terribly done, too, or done by people that don't get the history so it becomes a hollow experience. Well, Lethal Weapon 2 didn't try to be a very serious drama or anything. In fact, it took South African dudes as the bad guys and their awful racial biases and gave us a comedy. There are ridiculous accents (yes, Luke, it is an age old problem) to boot, though they did get some of the pronunciation down, and I laughed at the Afrikaans tossed in there. I was shocked at the rate the k-word was dropped because here, by us? Say it in the streets. I dare you. Either you are going to get your ass handed to you or you are going to land up fighting a massive legal battle. True story. The plot was alright here, and I liked the small little things that they did to make it authentic for the South African bad guy - how dangerous the country was then (when Murtaugh went with Leo to "move" to SA) and the shipping containers being "Transvaal Lines" and the Afrikaans cussing... very cool. I actually laughed with Murtaugh at his final joke for the movie - racial punning but it was funny. I am probably going to be shot. I liked the reveal of more of Riggs's past and the death of his wife, that was a little heavy. I was a huge fan of the partnership between Riggs and Murtaugh, obviously, and there were so many things that made me laugh (that commercial!), which is something I really value in a movie. Joe Pesci is introduced here, and while his character irritated me at times, I think he worked really well overall. It is such a cool thing for me to see how tight Riggs and Murtaugh are, and how Murtaugh's family has taken Riggs in. He really is a part of them. The humour was good, the action was well worth it, there was some cheese, pretty thin ideas and crazy shootouts and investigation techniques. The plot wasn't bad either, and there were some pretty intense South African throwbacks. Overall, I think that this holds up really well after all the years, so definitely an action film to check out and enjoy!

With the possible exception of Martin Rigg's mullet, which actually looks like it's been given a bit of a trim, everything about Lethal Weapon 2 is bigger than the first movie: the explosions are more explosive, the shoot-outs more shooty, the car crashes more crashy, the widdly guitar more widdly, and the warbling sax more warbly. As 80s action flicks go, this is definitely one of the best for spectacular vehicular chaos, ballistic mayhem, random acts of death and destruction, and tuneless music.Jeffrey Boam's script delivers on all counts, matching Shane Black's original in terms of wit, pathos, and excitement, and although it does introduce what would become one of the most irritating characters in cinematic history—fast talking money launderer Leo Getz (Joe Pesci)—at least Boam has the good sense to inflict a lot of pain and suffering on the guy in the process, Leo getting more than a few bruises as the story progresses.Seasoned Hollywood director Richard Donner handles proceedings well, balancing the light-hearted moments and the gritty action just right (a trick he seems to have forgotten come part 3), and with the benefit of a bigger budget than before, he gets to pull off some truly impressive action scenes, including the amazing destruction of an entire house on stilts.Part 2 also benefits immensely from a pair of memorable villains—South African diplomat Arjen Rudd, played by Joss Ackland, and his truly wicked henchman/assassin Pieter (Derrick O'Connor), and the welcome presence of the wooden but still very lovely Patsy Kensit, who very kindly strips off for a sex scene (the price we must pay for that pleasure is yet another Mel Gibson ass shot, but at least it's only a side view— not a full on crack shot like in the first film!).

There are a lot of reasons to rave about "Lethal Weapon 2": the comedy, the action, the plot, even the music. I'm sure all of these things have been highlighted before so I'd like to highlight something different."Lethal Weapon 2" was one of the rare American movies that had the courage to address South Africa and apartheid when it seemed like every movie focused on Russia as the bogeyman. Not that Russia wasn't a major nemesis, but South Africa was getting a total pass. To be honest, as a country we were too cozy and comfortable with South Africa considering what they were doing. I really appreciated LW2 putting South Africa on blast like they did.Politics aside, LW2 was a fabulous follow up to "Lethal Weapon." The addition of Joe Pesci was just terrific. His character was great comic relief and he complimented Murtaugh and Riggs so well. LW2 was a remarkable model of how to make a sequel: keep your core, add a nice complimentary character, and vary the plot. A simple equation but effective.

When I saw the first Lethal Weapon movie (admittedly I was underaged at the time) I thought a better flick could never be dreamed of.  I was wrong, its all here the chemistry between Glover & Gibson is better than ever, the action is faster and to my lasting surprise the comedy has been much improved.The inclusion of Joe Peschi as the whinny Leo Getz was a master stroke and finally completed the picture.SEE IT!

All we need to know is that the bad guys are bad, the good guys are crazy but good, and Joe Pesci is Joe Pesci. Some political commentary on the death throes of apartheid, which just reinforces that the villains have no hope of redemption. Part of the genre-defining buddy movies of the end of the 80s, where no heart-ache, post traumatic stress, survivor guilt, or losing loved ones or property to violence can't be solved in an instant with a cold beer and a quip from your partner. Suspend disbelief, switch off most of your cortex and jump in for the ride!

Lethal weapon 2 is a worthy sucessor to first one and it is as much as fun as previous one,this film is at quality almost equal to first but i had some staff that could be changed,even if i like pesci in most of films he was in,in this one he was to much for me and his character was least person in film that was intersting and he in moments become annoying with his way of speeking,he reminded me of his persona in goodfellas but in that film it worked a lot better,villains in this film are supirior then in last one and they suceed to make me to hate them,lethal weapon 2 is a very good sequal that showed again great chemistry and action setpieces

Many action flicks over the years have been called loud and dumb. This is no exception.

In keeping up the tradition of the original "Lethal Weapon", the sequel still continues the time-honoured tradition to providing the the action, the humour, and the thrills that made "Lethal Weapon I" one of the best buddy-cop movies in the history of cinema. The chemistry between Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover)is still remarkable. The only thing now is that Riggs is less self-destructive as he was in the first movie, but I guess it's so that in the first he tries to get over the loss of his wife and he somehow has moved on.

Some editing should have been taken to consideration. It's still an enjoyable film, but the first one stands above them all.

First of all this movie is almost as good as the original. It retains all of the elements that made the first film so darn entertaining and adds some new elements.As all actors from the first movie appear in the second one as well its pretty clear what you can expect acting wise and surprise, surprise: The acting is still stellar, close to perfection. Mel Gibson is always good and in the second installment of the series he gets to be a little more wild and add even more nuances to the character. For example we get to see Riggs hit on women which adds an entire new side to him as the side we saw in the first film was of him mourning. Also we find out how his wife dies in a beautifully underacted scene (if you want to know how she dies you'll have to see the movie). Danny Glover returns as well and he plays the character pretty much as he did in the first film which is good because the character he plays is the one who is not supposed to change. He is meant to be square and combined with the character of Riggs this becomes highly entertaining. However, a new element is put into the mix to make it even more entertaining, Leo Getz, played beautifully by Joe Pesci and is to this day still one of his most memorable characters. He is funny and fast talking but most importantly: he is a crook and when you put him together with Riggs and Murtaugh the mix becomes explosive. The main villains are played by Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor and they are also good and a bit more developed than the villains of the first movie obviously because they had to focus more on the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh in the first movie. Riggs' love interest is played Patsy Kensit and she is good if a bit underdeveloped. The story is excellent and is almost better than the story in the first one. It is entertaining and funny and best of all the incredible chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is maintained and is almost as good as it was in the first movie. Furthermore the addition of Joe Pesci was a very nice touch because he immediately makes the scenes with him, Gibson and Glover even more interesting and entertaining. The plot with the villains is kept relatively simple like in the first film, which is good because the goal for the film is entertainment not to be thought provoking.The action of the film is kept in the same style as in the first movie and it is still both exhilarating and entertaining. The effects are still relatively realistic and this of course gives the movie a level of credibility that is sorely needed in many modern action movies.All in all a worthy sequel and an excellent film on its own. 8/10

"Lethal Weapon 2" is the type of sequel you don't screw with, for fear of getting seriously beat up if you do. Luckily the praise comes as easily as the film is good -- and boy, is it good.If you haven't seen "Lethal Weapon" (1987), get off your computer, drop that Cheez-It out of your hand, rush to your closest video outlet and buy it. If you have seen it, then drop that Cheez-It out of your hand, rush to your closest video outlet and buy the sequel, "Lethal Weapon 2." It's a real ball-breaker, a bruiser, the type of film where the heroes get beat up mercilessly but when they get mad, boy are they mad, and they tear apart everything in their path that is standing in their way. There's a particular shoot-out scene aboard a docked ship where Riggs (Mel Gibson) goes on a rampage and really kicks butt with a vengeance.But I think I'm getting ahead of myself.The film opens with a high-speed car chase on a freeway in Downtown LA. Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are in hot pursuit, tearing up Murtaugh's wife's brand-new car as they chase the speeder through an underground tunnel, up a bridge, and so on and so forth.When they finally catch the speeder they find African gold hidden in the back of his truck. Soon they are being threatened to stay off of the case by African diplomats, one of whom Riggs really enjoys annoying. They can't arrest them because of diplomatic immunity, so Riggs goes in and shoots up the place where they're staying.Riggs finds himself a new girl (Patsy Kensit), while Murtaugh protects a federal witness named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a lovable little blabbermouth who likes being one of the cops. He waddles around throughout the film like a little eager puppy, ready to do anything he's told. Of course Riggs and Murtaugh pick on him throughout the movie, but their friendship is a sort of love-to-hate, explained in "Lethal Weapon 4" (1997).What a hard action movie/sequel this is. I had heard nothing very positive about this movie until right before I saw it. I sat down, watched it directly after I watched "Lethal Weapon," and realized just how great of a sequel it really is. It's not repetitive -- it continues the character progression and friendship seen at the end of "Lethal Weapon," while at the same time adding a bit more humor than the first film.One of the things I praise about the first "Lethal Weapon" movie is that the characters didn't just suddenly agree to like each other at the end of the movie like so many films. They gradually learned to trust each other throughout the film, adding a sense of true friendship and realism to the film. In "Lethal Weapon 2," the friendship between Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh is definitely expanded more to the point where they're best buddies. Most of the time when there is a sequel to a cop-buddy film, the directors and writers are afraid to continue the friendship. They seem to forget the end of the original film, and in the second film the characters hate each other again and the progress of friendship starts all over again. (As seen in such films as "Another 48 Hrs.")But "Lethal Weapon 2" is brave -- it isn't afraid to continue the story. I think that might be part of what makes it such a great, well-rounded series. It never really repeats itself, it always seems eager to move forward and ignore the past. The first film was a humorous, hard cop-buddy film about two opposites learning to trust each other. The second movie is a continuation of their friendship. The third film is almost a full-out comedy. And the fourth film is a tribute to the first three. Darn good film-making here."Lethal Weapon 2" is quite possibly one of the best sequels of all time. It avoids repetitions, it avoids cop-buddy clichés, and when it all comes down to it, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are such an amazing trio, that even if this film did follow the routine procedures I'd still love it. And you can't say that about many movies.

Lethal Weapon 2 (1989)The first half hour of this movie is such an empty mixture of very fast chase scenes and some dull talking between supposed bad guys you might not get to the final hour which is fun and funny and as good (in a way) as the first Lethal Weapon from two years earlier. Same cast, same crew, same assets.The problem at first is partly that we don't know who the bad guys are. We have no reason to fear or hate them. We just know that Mel and Danny have to be in on some new awful crime situation. That requires faith, so okay, we keep watching. The opening chase is highly kinetic and violent and spectacular, if you like that kind of thing. It is also a heads up for a couple scenes later that are also really spectacular —a ridiculous machine gun festival from a helicopter (if they have helicopters that have rocket grenades and boom, that's that), and a really ridiculous yanking down of a spectacular building with a GMC pickup truck (an amazing highlight of the movie).Yeah, it's a wonderful mixed bag. By the end I was loving it the way you love things like this—not as film studies, but as a lowbrow good time. There are some classic scenes, also ridiculous—like the great toilet one—and some filler, of course, but it clicks along and is a worthy sequel. If you liked the first, you'll like the second.However, it's worth saying the first one has an elegance at times that makes it not just more artful (who cares?) but more compelling. Just the way the first scene is handled (in the first movie) makes you want to know what's happening, and you worry about the next few scenes because of the first one. Here, it's more a continuation of affection—which means you might have to see the first one before this, in case you haven't!

In addition, if you're not able to take the second sequel of a buddy cop action movie in the "Lethal Weapon" series, ignore this review, as well.

In the first movie there were drug smugglers, former Vietnam vets of a Shadow Company, this time they are South African diplomats who are smuggling drugs, weapons and gold coins from South Africa. I love the opening scenes that are in the middle of a car chase through the 4th Street tunnel in downtown Los Angeles.

I have never seen her any other film role or on any other movie anymore.Lethal Weapon 2 is a 1989 American buddy cop action film directed by Richard Donner, and starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci , Patsy Kensit, Derrick O'Connor and Joss Ackland.

A worthy sequel. In fact, I think it's a bit of an improvement, with tighter plotting and more kinetic action sequences. I also liked, to my surprise, the addition of Joe Pesci as a witness Riggs and Murtaugh are protecting. Yes, he's more than a tad annoying, but he's annoying in a mostly funny way. I also very much liked Mel Gibson's love interest, played by the cute Brit Patsy Kensit, who unfortunately never made it very big. The sequence with the bomb attached to Murtaugh's toilet is classic, and the shot with the woman cop getting blown off her diving board is (unintentionally) hilarious. Also side-splitting: the aging henchman played by Derrick O'Connor, who becomes a master of kung fu whenever the shot gets dark enough for a stunt double to take his place.

The first one was hard core.  It was all about drugs, intrigue and Vietnam. It was also about Riggs' suicidal tendencies.  It was serious.  Too serious. That was awesome.  This one is about a lighter, gentler Riggs.  The same Murtaugh I'm afraid but a lighter gentler Riggs-for a while that is. Reasons why this film is better than the original:  1.  Leo Getz,  2.  Same chemistry but with a tighter bond,  3.  Comic relief,  4.  Truly despicable villains, 5.  Revenge story that pops out of nowhere really (this is quite surprising for a Gibson flick mind you).  This one's the best of the series. Part three was a joke.  Part four...I dunno what the hell that one was. Part one was pure setup baby.  This is the one.  >

Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are back. The movie opens with the cops in hot pursuit of some drugs. It ends up with a big action chase and a helicopter to fly the bad guys away. The bad guys are South African and they threaten Murtaugh and his family. So the captain gives them an easy job babysitting a witness Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who turns out to have laundered around half a billion dollar worth of drug money. And somebody immediately tries to kill him.The chemistry is still great for the two guys. The car chase scene right off the bat only highlights their relationship. Joe Pesci adds a fun comedic element into this duo. This is energetic fun. It's funny, and it has good action. The only thing off is the South African bad guy. He is too much like a Bond villain. That's a different franchise.

Lethal Weapon 2: A complete review in as short as possibleIf you're looking for an extremely enjoyable movie, in all aspects of the word "enjoyable" i seriously recommend this masterpiece! It has everything anyone can ask for: a star-studded cast, excellent performances, masterful directions, engrossing story, amazing action-sequences, witty dialogue, sensational sound track, and this is just the beginning! And if this is not MAGIC then I don't know what is!Gibson's Riggs and Glover's Murtaugh are amazing, the chemistry here is absolutely amazing! Each complements the other perfectly and the inclusion of Pesci's Getz is the best thing that could have ever happened to the movie.It's not just the performances either. LW2 is an excellent follow-up to the original that spawned 4 sequels and is a MUST-SEE. As a matter of fact, I personally find it to be the best movie throughout the series. Do not pass this one up!Oomph!-scale (from 5) : *****

Coming from somebody who really enjoyed the first 'Lethal Weapon', while not considering it quite perfect, this is quite high praise. Although there are sequels that are as good as their predecessors is nearly better ('Godfather Part II', 'Terminator 2', 'Aliens') there are many others that don't measure up and some even disgracing them.'Lethal Weapon 2', thank goodness, is not one of those films. But saying that it is almost as good as the first 'Lethal Weapon' is genuinely meant, even if it is not in the same league as the three sequels listed above that are almost as good and nearly better. 'Lethal Weapon 2' has its faults but the good things are many and very obvious to spot.It is let down a little by a script that's at times inconsistent, with the tone sometimes forced and confused and like it's trying to do too much. While the action is mostly great, the helicopter scene is somewhat implausible, more so than most of the script in the first film.Most of the performances are spot on, but two didn't really do it for me. One was Patsy Kensit, who is attractive but looks lost. The other is Joss Ackland's hammy villain who looks like he belongs in another film entirely. Not things that everybody is going to share but just personal opinion.However, like 'Lethal Weapon', the way 'Lethal Weapon 2' is shot and designed screams slick and stylish while Richard Donner once again directs with an assured hand. The score is atmospheric and groovy.Despite not finding all the script working, a lot of it does with some cracking, sometimes hilarious humour, tension and dark pathos. The story is tightly structured and plotted, with some great tension and always being fun. Loved the bathroom scene, one of the best and most unique on film.Once again, the action is slick and bursts with excitement and tension, apart from one that suffers from excessive implausibility. It is very easy to see why the chalk and cheese chemistry of the polar opposite characters of Riggs and Murtaugh became so popular, very rarely in a buddy-cop film has this kind of chemistry been so entertaining and perfectly pitched.Mel Gibson continues to excel in a performance as witty and intense has before. Danny Glover gives Murtaugh the right amount of spirit, subtlety and no-nonsense attitude. They are matched well by Joe Pesci, who is a motormouth delight, and Derrick O'Connor who gives much more of a sinister edge than Ackland (have noticed that in both films that the henchman has always been the more memorable and better played than the lead villain).In summary, very well done and just as good. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Two years after having "shot Air America down" in LA, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh are cracking down on another fascist gang: White supremacist South-African Nazis who are drug dealers hiding behind diplomatic immunity. In this second episode, Martin finds a new love interest embodied by sweet and lovely Patsy Kensit A great antifacist and antiracist movie, and one of the best films of 1989 (a great year at the movies).

The first one had a completely fresh and enjoyable concept - What happens when you pair an older cop who has a family that he loves and who just wants to live to see retirement (Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh) with a younger cop who has nothing to lose after the death of his wife and seems to have a death wish himself (Mel Gibson as Martin Riggs)?So this film picks up where the first one left off, with Riggs still doing wild and crazy things, yet he now seems to want to live. He has also found a taste of family in his partner's wife and kids and spends lots of free time with them. To me those small scenes between Riggs and Martaugh's family are the best in the film.The film's villain was a favorite punching bag of the day - and rightfully so - apartheid enforcing South Africa. So unless you know something of how that country was run historically, this plot might not make much sense to you. The actual villain is Arjen Rudd, a South African diplomat and the corrupt Minister of Affairs for the South African consulate in Los Angeles. He uses diplomatic immunity to manage to do all kinds of illegal racketeering and murder in defense of that racketeering . Now this is not really how diplomatic immunity works. The first time the diplomat is arrested, the country of origin has a choice. If it cares about its reputation and thinks the charges are valid, that country could allow you to be charged in America. If they don't care or don't think that the charges are valid, you would be protected by diplomatic immunity that first time. But then the country in which you are serving - in this case America - could just kick you out in which you can kiss your criminal career goodbye. But if this happened then we would have no plot.I always thought the movie seemed disjointed, especially towards the end. Then I learned that it was originally intended that this would be the only sequel and so the script was changed multiple times, resulting in an ending that just didn't ring true to me. But it is still a pretty good action buddy flick.

Riggs and Murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated. The story line is just awful! I mean really, South African diplomats smuggling the mythical Krugerrands into the U.S. It's just painful! And the accents are absolutely abysmal! Can no one get an Afrikaans South African accent right? Or will we forever hear the British or Americans making them sound like drunken Hollanders? The only guy who got the Afrikaans accent right was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that i disliked was when Danny Glover so artlessly describes an Afrikaans accent as being shitty! I mean what a slap in the face to the Afrikaans. There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. I mean Mel Gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their P.A. type! Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film. If you want to see a film that doesn't completely insult a cultural group then rent Die Hard 2.

Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return to kick heads and shoot bad guys for the second time, as Riggs and Murtaugh, the "Oscar and Felix" of law enforcement in "Lethal Weapon 2." This timearound, the boys are forced to become the 3 Stooges when they are assigned to guard a feisty, foul-mouthed federal witness named Leo Getz (the frantic Joe Pesci) from a group of sadistic Afrikaner thugs (led by the usually dark-natured character actor Joss Acklund). At the same time, Riggs meets a new love namedRika (the hot Patsy Kensit), who happens to be a pawn in thevillain's dangerous games.The action is faster and more furious in this sequel to theslam-bang original. Even the banter gets a boost, thanks to theadded comedic riff by Pesci. Watch for his slightly annoying,yet hilarious speech on a Subway tunafish sandwich!

I must say that I enjoyed this one, though I was shocked, too. Now that I am older and I understand the nature of my country, to see a film focused so heavily on South African baddies pre the fall of Apartheid was heavy. Now, if you're from South Africa, just about any movies that refer back to our country way back in the day are bound to peeve you. They are usually stacked full of white guilt and terribly done, too, or done by people that don't get the history so it becomes a hollow experience. Well, Lethal Weapon 2 didn't try to be a very serious drama or anything. In fact, it took South African dudes as the bad guys and their awful racial biases and gave us a comedy. There are ridiculous accents (yes, Luke, it is an age old problem) to boot, though they did get some of the pronunciation down, and I laughed at the Afrikaans tossed in there. I was shocked at the rate the k-word was dropped because here, by us? Say it in the streets. I dare you. Either you are going to get your ass handed to you or you are going to land up fighting a massive legal battle. True story. The plot was alright here, and I liked the small little things that they did to make it authentic for the South African bad guy - how dangerous the country was then (when Murtaugh went with Leo to "move" to SA) and the shipping containers being "Transvaal Lines" and the Afrikaans cussing... very cool. I actually laughed with Murtaugh at his final joke for the movie - racial punning but it was funny. I am probably going to be shot. I liked the reveal of more of Riggs's past and the death of his wife, that was a little heavy. I was a huge fan of the partnership between Riggs and Murtaugh, obviously, and there were so many things that made me laugh (that commercial!), which is something I really value in a movie. Joe Pesci is introduced here, and while his character irritated me at times, I think he worked really well overall. It is such a cool thing for me to see how tight Riggs and Murtaugh are, and how Murtaugh's family has taken Riggs in. He really is a part of them. The humour was good, the action was well worth it, there was some cheese, pretty thin ideas and crazy shootouts and investigation techniques. The plot wasn't bad either, and there were some pretty intense South African throwbacks. Overall, I think that this holds up really well after all the years, so definitely an action film to check out and enjoy!

With the possible exception of Martin Rigg's mullet, which actually looks like it's been given a bit of a trim, everything about Lethal Weapon 2 is bigger than the first movie: the explosions are more explosive, the shoot-outs more shooty, the car crashes more crashy, the widdly guitar more widdly, and the warbling sax more warbly. As 80s action flicks go, this is definitely one of the best for spectacular vehicular chaos, ballistic mayhem, random acts of death and destruction, and tuneless music.Jeffrey Boam's script delivers on all counts, matching Shane Black's original in terms of wit, pathos, and excitement, and although it does introduce what would become one of the most irritating characters in cinematic history—fast talking money launderer Leo Getz (Joe Pesci)—at least Boam has the good sense to inflict a lot of pain and suffering on the guy in the process, Leo getting more than a few bruises as the story progresses.Seasoned Hollywood director Richard Donner handles proceedings well, balancing the light-hearted moments and the gritty action just right (a trick he seems to have forgotten come part 3), and with the benefit of a bigger budget than before, he gets to pull off some truly impressive action scenes, including the amazing destruction of an entire house on stilts.Part 2 also benefits immensely from a pair of memorable villains—South African diplomat Arjen Rudd, played by Joss Ackland, and his truly wicked henchman/assassin Pieter (Derrick O'Connor), and the welcome presence of the wooden but still very lovely Patsy Kensit, who very kindly strips off for a sex scene (the price we must pay for that pleasure is yet another Mel Gibson ass shot, but at least it's only a side view— not a full on crack shot like in the first film!).

There are a lot of reasons to rave about "Lethal Weapon 2": the comedy, the action, the plot, even the music. I'm sure all of these things have been highlighted before so I'd like to highlight something different."Lethal Weapon 2" was one of the rare American movies that had the courage to address South Africa and apartheid when it seemed like every movie focused on Russia as the bogeyman. Not that Russia wasn't a major nemesis, but South Africa was getting a total pass. To be honest, as a country we were too cozy and comfortable with South Africa considering what they were doing. I really appreciated LW2 putting South Africa on blast like they did.Politics aside, LW2 was a fabulous follow up to "Lethal Weapon." The addition of Joe Pesci was just terrific. His character was great comic relief and he complimented Murtaugh and Riggs so well. LW2 was a remarkable model of how to make a sequel: keep your core, add a nice complimentary character, and vary the plot. A simple equation but effective.

A terrific sequel to one of the first action duo films that worked well. Adding Joe Pesci to the cast, what a great choice! He was so funny, together, Mel, Danny, and Joe are the three stooges of Lethal Weapon. They work together so well. This movie has everything that you could want: action, romance, comedy, and drama.Again, like in my last Lethal Weapon comment, must we go on for ten sentences? I mean, is it just me or isn't that a little silly? I think so. It's like, you can't just put down you liked the movie or hated it? I miss the old IMDb! *sob!* 8/10 PS: Ask me questions about the movie if you have doubts about me witnessing it's glory.

Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are on the trail of South African diplomats who are using their immunity to engage in criminal activities.This is not as "classic" as the original, and lacks that Christmas element, but we have some new fun. Joe Pesci is here, though not used to his fullest. The "diplomatic immunity" idea is great, and there still remains debate to this day (2016) if such a thing could be used to facilitate crime. Allegedly, the Chicago mob used this method in Panama.But the key scene that makes this film memorable is the "toilet bomb" scene. If nothing else, that one scene will make this go down in history as one of the essential buddy cop movies.

When I saw the first Lethal Weapon movie (admittedly I was underaged at the time) I thought a better flick could never be dreamed of.  I was wrong, its all here the chemistry between Glover & Gibson is better than ever, the action is faster and to my lasting surprise the comedy has been much improved.The inclusion of Joe Peschi as the whinny Leo Getz was a master stroke and finally completed the picture.SEE IT!

Just as fun as the first one , this movie manages to pull out all the punches to deliever an entertaining sequal once more our friends gibson and glover are back at it to stop the bad guys before it is too late. And this time around there is a new addition to the crew. Joe pesci is a pretty good addition and his chemistry works with the other two, I look forword to seeing him in the other films. We have great action scenes and jokes once more and a poor mertof getting caught in a compromising position involing a bomb. A young dean norris also appears and is fun for the time we see him. Overall this is what a good action sequal is and another classic.

'Lethal Weapon 2' is the absolute perfect example of why the eighties were the renaissance of the action film. I've seen so many bad action films that it becomes hard to decipher what makes an excellent one but I feel that 'Lethal Weapon 2' should be studied as an example. It has all the ingredients I think are essential to making a good action film. The movie most importantly has incredible loud action sequences that have weight because they aren't mired in computer effects or post production trickery and have stunt performers. It also isn't fearful in indulging in violence without being gratuitous. It isn't realistic and there's theatricality but it's not at the two extremes of cartoony blood or PG-13 action fast cuts when someone gets shot. It has grit and blood but it's also so alive with great characters.Most importantly are the characters and the acting. This film solves the problem of the first film in having memorable villains. The whole South Africa apartheid villainy is played for all the hate you can project on these goofy characters. Joss Ackland is so delightful. His performance masterfully skates at being just campy enough to get all the smiles you can without going into the ridiculous. But of course the bulk of the praise must go to the leads. Glover and Gibson are so charismatic and likable that the scenes where they drive to the shoot outs are still highly entertaining. I had a ball revisiting this one.

Lethal weapon 2 is a worthy sucessor to first one and it is as much as fun as previous one,this film is at quality almost equal to first but i had some staff that could be changed,even if i like pesci in most of films he was in,in this one he was to much for me and his character was least person in film that was intersting and he in moments become annoying with his way of speeking,he reminded me of his persona in goodfellas but in that film it worked a lot better,villains in this film are supirior then in last one and they suceed to make me to hate them,lethal weapon 2 is a very good sequal that showed again great chemistry and action setpieces

Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) was a lame and useless sequel. Why was this made? To make more money! The first film was a surprise success. So a sequel was in order. What I hated about this movie was they changed the back ground story line. Riggs suddenly got younger but Murtaugh grew even older than he was in the first film. Riggs background was changed to suit the inane storyline.Like I said in the last comment. The series became more homo-erotic as the series continued. Another strike against the film are the cartoon villains. The only thing missing was them sporting thick mustaches and smoking big cigars. I hated this movie. The action scenes were over done and realism only mattered when it suited the story line. Adding characters and making overt and annoying political statements date this lame movie even further. While the first film was fun, this one blows chunks. I don't like it very much.Overrated garbage.
