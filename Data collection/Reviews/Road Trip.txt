Road Trip is a good movie with a decent storyline that is certainly a cliché college movie but a lovable cast and enjoyable characters make it more watchable that most immature college movies.Its nothing close to a fantastic comedy and certainly not Todd Phillips finest work,but there are still plenty of funny scenes to make this a short fun movie to watch,preferably with friends.The best part of the movie was definitely Breckin Meyer and Seann William Scott,I always enjoy these two,even when I see a movie with them that i'm not particularly enjoying,they make it more bearable,and they both worked really well with each other in this.If your taste in comedy is fussy,I wouldn't recommend Road Trip,but if you want a short movie to have a good few laughs at,it will definitely deliver.Four college students set of on a road trip to stop their buddy's girlfriend from receiving an explicit home made video tape of her unfaithful boyfriend in action.

I didn't go into this movie expecting to like it. I expected it to be brimming with nothing but pop culture Mtv nonsense. I didn't expect much interest nor did I expect much genuine ha-ha comedy. However being the huge film buff that I am, I decided to give it a shot at the 2 dollar second run theater. I was pleasantly surprised. I found myself often laughing out loud (something I hardly ever do). When they try to ramp the broken bridge and the wheels fall of their car, I thought I was going to bust a gut.
All in all, I was pleased with the crazy adventure the story provided. A young freshman mistakenly sends a cheating sex video to his long distance girlfriend, so he and his friends have three days to drive across the US to retrieve before she sees it. The movie details the trip and the crazy situations the boys get themselves into. This plot, while not the cleverest, has a lot of comedic potential and the writer/director/actors take pretty good advantage of these opportunities. Sure the characters aren't that deep, but in a comedy you don't need deep characters, you need funny ones. This movie provides many to laugh at and with.  FINAL RATING: 7/10 A great comedy genre film that is genuinely laugh-out-loud funny in many parts. Characters are interesting and most importantly, they are FUNNY! Well worth my time and 2 bucks.

This is a typical movie that's perfect to watch to kill some time with. It's by no means a great, or highly memorable movie but it's still a movie that serves its purpose.Even though I highly enjoyed watching this movie, it wasn't as funny as expected. The movie could had really used some more comical sequences and situations. There were many missed opportunities in the movie but still that doesn't of course mean that the movie is bad. The biggest strength of the movie is its fun feeling. There are some great comical moments, although not as many and as constant as I expected and hoped for.Another great thing about the movie are the characters. Breckin Meyer might not had been the best choice for the main character but all the other characters are simply great to watch, especially DJ Qualls. Tom Green's antics were not always funny simply because he isn't a great actor. It also was perhaps a bit too much distracting from the main storyline.It's a great movie for teenager to watch and it has some typical teenagers humor in it, which I'm sure they'll find hilarious at times. Adults will most likely not be able to fully appreciate all the jokes in the movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

I found this movie to be funny, when compared to Something About Mary and American Pie.  And since it is in that arena, it gets a good reputation (though doesn't live up to it's precedors).  I found the plot alone humorous- College guy (Breckin Meyer) from Ithica, who is dating a girl (Rachel Blanchard)in Austin since he was little, tapes a sex tape with another girl by accident and mails it to her, so he must retrieve it with his friends (Seann W. Scott, DJ Qualls and Paulo Costanzo). 
The Always hilarious (especially here) Tom Green brings us along in this story as he tells the story to a tour group and also includes himself as a experimentist and snake feeder with mice.  The wackiness and sickness in this film brings out the best and it is dead pan funny.  One of the best comedies of the year.  Look for cameos by Horatio Sanz, Andy Dick and Fred Ward.  A

Exactly what I was expecting from Tom Green! An absolutely hilarious movie that made me laugh out loud throughout. Excellent mixture of gross-out humor, sex and nudity - including a great nude shot of hot young actress Amy Smart!! Irreverent and zany, worth frying your brains for 90 minutes!

While Road Trip is nothing groundbreaking in the movie world, no one really expected it to be.  You have to appreciate this movie for what it is: a mindless little comedy. Once you've thrown you're expectations out the window, what you'll get is an hour and half of solid laughs.  When you boil it down to it, it's basically just a series of gags, strung together with a very weak plot structure. But who cares, for all its shortcomings, there are moments you will be laughing too hard to even notice. Stand out scenes include an uncomfortable encounter at an all-black fraternity and the unforgettable sperm bank hijinx (I am curious if that practice is endorsed by the medical world). Green is his expected eccentric self, although his screen time is very minimal. (His experimentation with certain rodents would make even Richard Gere proud.) And as for Sean William Scott, it seems as if he'll be typecast as Stiffler for the rest of his career, which is not all bad.  All in all the movie delivers with laughs throughout making it a worthwhile experience. It is exactly what a movie of this nature should be. 3 out of 5 stars.

God, this movie is hilarious. It is about a college student that makes video chats for his girlfriend. She is in school in Texas while he is in upstate New York. We are not talking new video chats, we are talking actual recorded on a camcorder videos. This movie is almost 20 years old after all. He stops hearing from her, and thinking she is ghosting him and seeing someone else, he gives in to temptation and sleeps with a girl at his school. The joke being that he accidentally records it. The next day his girlfriend calls and he realizes that he mailed her the sex video. So he and three friends go on a road trip to intercept the video. This is a very funny film. Anything with Sean William Scott is bound to be so.

Okay, first off, road trip is not for everyone, it's just not. This movie does have a good bit of sexual content and some nudity, so if that offends you, stay away. Sean William Scott was great in this film, he was perfectly cast in his womanizing hot dude role. And Amy smart was good in this movie too, I like her in it. I really did think I would hate this movie, but I was actually pleasantly surprised. Now yes, the sex and nudity got to be a bit much in a few scenes, but it want pervasive or anything. The actors in this film did a good job with their comedy, the main actors all gave sufficient performances. The movie does a good job of catering to the college age audience. Overall, a 7/10, Sean William Scott was my personal favorite part.

I saw this "movie" last night, and I am absolutely agast to see the positive reviews here. I love comedy, but this movie was only unintentionally funny. There was not one redeeming joke in the entire movie, the characters were dull and underdeveloped (not to mention, I both despised and couldn't relate to them, no matter how hard the director tried to get me to)I can't think of one time I honestly laughed. I like Tom Green, but his talents (such as they are) are wasted here. Juvenile gross-out humor only works when it's funny and/or balanced out by other sorts of humor. Neither of this happens in the putrid claptrap of a movie. I hope the makers of this monstrosity are prevented from making another movie. I mean, seriously, when are they going to make a movie about/for teenagers that is smart and worthy of our viewing time. Hollywood really thinks teenagers are stupid and unable to be entertained by anything but farts and fingers up the bottom. I hope they are wrong.~

The R-rated teen comedies is a fairly new genre, that has created numerous films of varying quality over the past few years. The best of them is arguably American Pie, and while this one comes close, it just doesn't reach the same high level of quality. It is, however, very close. The plot is very good; it's based on a mix-up(an uncommon mix-up, but not an entirely unbelievable one, I suppose), and on various situations that most teen guys could definitely relate to. The acting is good, all of the leads give pretty good performances, as well as most of the supporting characters. Of course, a somewhat well-known teen-movie actor Seann William Scott is expected to be good, but Amy Smart, Paulo Costanzo, DJ Qualls and Breckin Meyer impressed me, partly because I hadn't seen them in any other movies. The characters are well-written, credible and you can mostly relate to them. The humor is great; it's typical R-rated teen comedy humor, and it's really done great. It's hardly ever overplayed, and there aren't really any of the gags or jokes that fall flat. What puts this slightly below American Pie on the overall entertainment scale is the way this seems to be in a rush to get done with many scenes, and just squeeze as many jokes and gags out in as short time as possible, in order to get to the next scene; American Pie mastered the art that is pacing. It was laid-back, calm and easy to get used to. This has so much stuff crammed into it in such a short amount of time that if you don't pay attention you might miss something. It also has fewer situations that you can relate to than American Pie. One thing that this film has a great amount of is re-watch value; I've seen it no less than ten times now, and I'm not the slightest bit tired of it, which is more than what I can say about American Pie. All in all, a pretty good R-rated teen comedy, but not the best. I recommend it to any fan of teen comedies. 7/10

ROAD TRIP stars Breckin Meyer as Josh Parker, a college student who accidently has a tape of him cheating on his girlfriend mailed to her. What to do? Go on a road trip with his buddies to get to the tape before it gets to her. On the way, they get into some hysterical situations and give great comedic performances. There are a lot of road movies, but this is the very best one.

I watched this movie far too much as a teenager, before i had a DVD player i only had a handful of VHS tapes. This was one of them.The story is simple, the main character Josh sleeps with a girl at a party and records it, he then accidentally posts the video to his girlfriend who lives in another state. Then the road trip begins. Josh and his 3 friends set off in a race against time to get to his girlfriend before the tape does!This film is a real American teen type of film that follows the pattern of many in that genre. It has plenty of laugh out loud moments and a very likable group of characters, (bar Tom Green)Definitely worth a watch if you have a couple of hours to kill and fancy an easy watching film with many laughs.

How can I explain this movie?  IT'S HILARIOUS!!  Though you know the plot is no more than a setup for one wacky situation after another, it works and it works great.  This comedy pushes the envelope in every aspect, and smiles proudly.  Tom Green, who gets a pretty small role, is the scene-stealer. Fans of him will be very impressed.  One moment that had me almost on the floor was the French toast scene with SNL regular Horatio Sanz.  I don't want to give away any of the comedy, because that would be a sin.  Just take my word:  You will love this movie!  You will not stop laughing!  This is one trip worth taking!

If you were in college in the 90s or early 2000s and appreciate crude humor and a goofy movie with a basic plot you'll enjoy this. It really captures the utter freedom of college of 4 guys who go on a wacky road trip with reckless abandon. It speaks to the college experience- sex jokes, dorm room hookups, a frat, a college party, and just young college kids having fun. It was before smart phones were a thing and the main character is trying to intercept the wrong vhs tape sent in the mail. If you went on a road trip with buddies you'll relate. Some of it's way over the top, but it's just a movie.

Hm... I don't understand what's beautiful in this vulgar movie? Why you all love it so? Yep, I agree - I'm Russian and I can't wait something like Gaidai's humor from American directors. But...When I get DVD with this movie, I thought it's good movie: I saw many of my favorite actors in titles! But when I have seen it at home I was very angry: surreal script not like Gilliam's but like Kokshenov's: nasty boys freaked out one nerd who wants to be with his favorite girl. One of boys (who have a girlfriend!) sleeps with this girls and he sent tape with sex to his real girl. Ha-ha! Very funny! There's a lot of violence and nudity film but there's no kindness in this movie. And, after all, I don't wanted to see Amy Smart's ugly breast. So, movie's terrible. I hate this film.-100/10

Road Trip is a feel-good college comedy that is both hilarious and heartfelt. The humour keeps the movie interesting and the heart keeps it from being stupid. Well, there are some stupid moments, but none of which diminish the overall result. The stupidity mainly comes from Tom Green, but who doesn't like pre-Freddy Got Fingered Tom Green?The movie starts out with Tom Green as an eighth year college student at Ithaca University giving a tour to potential students, trying to sell them the idea of attending the school. He is not doing a good job, until he tells a story of what happened the year before. This is the main part of the film:Josh Parker (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany Henderson have been best friends forever and have been boyfriend and girlfriend since they started liking the opposite sex. Josh goes to school at Ithaca and Tiffany goes to school in Austin, Texas. They try to make their long-distance relationship work, with Josh even going so far as to mail her weekly video tapes (like Skype). But Josh is tempted to get with fellow-student, Beth (Amy Smart), especially since he is somewhat of a rival for her with TA Jacob (Anthony Rapp). After a party, Josh gives in and sleeps with Beth, recording it on tape. His roommate, Rubin (Paulo Costanzo) accidentally mails the sex tape to Tiffany. This beginning of the film is hilarious, even the scene when they find out the wrong tape was mailed. So Josh, Rubin, Josh's best friend E.L. (Seann William Scott) persuade their geeky neighbour, Kyle (DJ Qualls) to take his car and retrieve the tape. The adventure portion is classic road material. They crash a party at a black fraternity, donate sperm, crash Kyle's car, among other things. Meanwhile, Tom Green awaits Rubin's snake eating a mouse and tells Beth that Tiffany is in Boston.Aside from the situations being hilarious, the characters need to be awesome too. Josh is Meyer's usual geek that he always makes work. E.L. is exactly like Stifler from American Pie. I don't mind, Stifler's awesome, E.L. could be his cousin! Rubin is a cool dude and really smart. He is awesome with physics and helps Josh pass his Ancient philosophy exam. Kyle is an ugly wimp who learns to stand up for himself. Tom Green's character's name is Barry Manilow. His obsession with seeing the snake eat the mouse is priceless. The film ends well and funnily too.You can't really say that this movie achieves the status of excellence or anything. This is about enjoying college life. It is just a simple film to make people laugh, without insulting their intelligence.3.5/4

I loved this film as a teen, it was stupid, crass, unrealistic, wacky, gross and crude...and when you're a teen those traits are what make films hilarious. It matters not if the film is critically acclaimed, back then what matters is the sheer wackiness mixed with bad words and OTT crudeness... I didn't expect to still like this film when I re-watched it recently, and I was wrong. I'm delighted to say that Road Trip is STILL funny.Although, as important as Tom Green is to the film he still gives me the shivers a little even today, he played the part of a full-on looper quite well.Films of this genre that come out nowadays just don't have the same feel as Road Trip. Road Trip came out at the end of the 90s kid era, and represented a lot of the great things about being a 90s teen. Admittedly, I was too young to watch it at the time but I can empathise with the era being born in 1992. With the exception of Superbad, not many great equivalents of Road Trip came out when I was a teen myself, kids of my era had to always look back a few years to the likes of Road Trip and American Pie for our laughs... not that we minded.I plan to watch Road Trip again 10 years from now, I'm confident it'll still make me laugh even then. Peace.

I didn't go into this movie expecting to like it. I expected it to be brimming with nothing but pop culture Mtv nonsense. I didn't expect much interest nor did I expect much genuine ha-ha comedy.

In the University of Ithaca, while showing the campus to the new students and their relatives, the veteran tour guide Barry Manilow (Tom Green) tells the love story of his friend Josh Parker (Breckin Meyer). Josh has a girlfriend, Tiffany Henderson (Rachel Blanchard), who went to the University of Austin, and they promised to be faithful to each other. However, Josh has an affair with his sexy friend Beth Wagner (Amy Smart), and they accidentally videotape it. One of his friends sends the videotape to Tiffany by mistake, and Josh decides to travel to Austin with his friends E.L. (Seann William Scott), Rubin Carver (Paulo Costanzo) and Kyle Edwards (DJ Qualls) to retrieve the videotape before Tiffany sees it. Will he succeed?"Road Trip" is a very funny comedy even when the viewer sees more than one time. Using the same storyline of "Overnight Delivery (1998)", with Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon, in the style of "Animal House" and "American Pie", "Road Trip" is so hilarious that makes laughing almost uninterruptedly with the humorous situations created by Barry Manilow, Josh, E.L., Rubin Carver and Kyle Edwards. Amy Smart is very sexy and DJ Qualls is the funniest character. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Caindo na Estrada" ("Hitting the Road")

Usually this kind of film turns me off, but I was talked into watching 'Road Trip' with a bunch of college buddies and a couple of twelve-packs, and I couldn't stop laughing.Josh (Breckin Meyer) has loved Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) since they were both five years old. But Josh attends college in upstate New York, while Tiffany has gone to school in Texas. Josh's friends think he's crazy to keep up a long-distance relationship when there are plenty of girls around to . . . date. Particularly alluring is Beth (Amy Smart), who has the hots for Josh. When Josh is unable to locate Tiffany by phone and begins to suspect that she's been cheating on him, he gives in to his urges and brings Beth back to his dorm room for a night of hot love. Beth, eager to show how wild she can be, decides to videotape the encounter. The next day, Josh finds out that he couldn't reach Tiffany because of a family emergency, and is immediately wracked with guilt. Things get more complicated when his knuckleheaded suitemate Barry mistakes the sex tape for a video message to Tiffany which Josh had asked him to drop in the mail. Horrified at the thought of Tiffany popping a tape into the VCR to see him making the double-backed beast with another girl, Josh determines to travel to Texas to intercept the illicit tape. His two best friends--resident prankster E.L. (Sean W. Scott) and stoner-intellectual Rubin (Paul Costanzo)--offer to come along, and help Josh persuade mega-nerd Kyle (D.J. Qualls) to let them use his father's car in exchange for a chance to come along for the ride. From that point on, 'Road Trip' follows the traditional teen exploitation comedy format, though with greater wit and intelligence than should be expected from the genre. Director Todd Phillips manages to give us slapstick, gross-out comedy while simultaneously poking fun at stereotypes and experiences familiar to anyone who's gone to college (psycho-sorority hazing, TAs trying to make undergrad girls, alcohol- and pot-related shenanigans, the nerd breaking bad, a hilarious run-in at an all-black fraternity house,etc.). Compensating for the adolescent hijinks is the surprisingly smart and thoughtful subplot for Kyle, who transforms from nerdy object of derision into the film's most likable and memorable character.In the tradition of 'Animal House,' 'Road Trip' is crass and juvenile, but irresistibly funny. Not a movie for date night, but a good choice for gathering around the tube with bongs, brews, and bros. An instant joe six-pack classic.

Road Trip is a good movie with a decent storyline that is certainly a cliché college movie but a lovable cast and enjoyable characters make it more watchable that most immature college movies.Its nothing close to a fantastic comedy and certainly not Todd Phillips finest work,but there are still plenty of funny scenes to make this a short fun movie to watch,preferably with friends.The best part of the movie was definitely Breckin Meyer and Seann William Scott,I always enjoy these two,even when I see a movie with them that i'm not particularly enjoying,they make it more bearable,and they both worked really well with each other in this.If your taste in comedy is fussy,I wouldn't recommend Road Trip,but if you want a short movie to have a good few laughs at,it will definitely deliver.Four college students set of on a road trip to stop their buddy's girlfriend from receiving an explicit home made video tape of her unfaithful boyfriend in action.

Overall, a 7/10, Sean William Scott was my personal favorite part.

Wow.  I just watched this movie for the first time after many friends I formerly respected recommended it.  To be honest, it wasn't all bad, just the parts that Tom Green had anything at all to do with.  Mr. Green is as funny as Will Ferrell doing his taxes while watching "Ishtar" in a burning orphanage on the Titanic.  He is to comedy what Stephen Hawking is to comedy.  His brand of "humor" is for those people that use phrases like "book-lurnin'" and found "Animal House" and "Police Academy" far too cerebral and uppity.  His success can only be explained by way of speculation that he has made some sort of deal with Satan, undoubtedly that Tom will be given fame and riches, on the condition that he never set foot in Hell as I'm sure even Satan's standards for humor are higher than this. Sorry.  Was I ranting just then?  I feel so cleansed.
On to the rest of the movie.  Predictable, yes, but not without a few laughs.  Many of these are provided at the expense of taste, but anyone who watches this movie should be expecting that based on the familiar teen movie cast.  Check your standards at the door.Don't get me wrong, I don't consider this movie to be a waste of time. It gave me a chance to work on my Tom Green effigy.

Similar in style to American Pie, and ultimately stemmed from the likes of Porkys and Animal house, this movie was right up my street.Josh Parker is separated from his childhood sweetheart by a difference of collage and of course 1800 Miles, until he videos himself having sex with someone else and accidentally sends it to her.The road trip then begins, and its a journey of disaster, discovery and above all laughs, as Josh tries to get to his sweetheart before the tape does.A really funny film, with the right ingredients.8/10 Also check out, American Pie, Old School and if you fancy something older try Porkys and Animal house.

This is a regulation teen/college student flick that supplies enough laughs to be successful. Tom Green was however the star of the movie. His scenes would generate a smile from the audience in anticipation of what was about to happen.These American movies with lower budgets than most the Hollywood big budget trash seem to produce better results as well.

I saw this "movie" last night, and I am absolutely agast to see the positive reviews here. I love comedy, but this movie was only unintentionally funny. There was not one redeeming joke in the entire movie, the characters were dull and underdeveloped (not to mention, I both despised and couldn't relate to them, no matter how hard the director tried to get me to)I can't think of one time I honestly laughed. I like Tom Green, but his talents (such as they are) are wasted here. Juvenile gross-out humor only works when it's funny and/or balanced out by other sorts of humor. Neither of this happens in the putrid claptrap of a movie. I hope the makers of this monstrosity are prevented from making another movie. I mean, seriously, when are they going to make a movie about/for teenagers that is smart and worthy of our viewing time. Hollywood really thinks teenagers are stupid and unable to be entertained by anything but farts and fingers up the bottom. I hope they are wrong.~

The R-rated teen comedies is a fairly new genre, that has created numerous films of varying quality over the past few years. The best of them is arguably American Pie, and while this one comes close, it just doesn't reach the same high level of quality. It is, however, very close. The plot is very good; it's based on a mix-up(an uncommon mix-up, but not an entirely unbelievable one, I suppose), and on various situations that most teen guys could definitely relate to. The acting is good, all of the leads give pretty good performances, as well as most of the supporting characters. Of course, a somewhat well-known teen-movie actor Seann William Scott is expected to be good, but Amy Smart, Paulo Costanzo, DJ Qualls and Breckin Meyer impressed me, partly because I hadn't seen them in any other movies. The characters are well-written, credible and you can mostly relate to them. The humor is great; it's typical R-rated teen comedy humor, and it's really done great. It's hardly ever overplayed, and there aren't really any of the gags or jokes that fall flat. What puts this slightly below American Pie on the overall entertainment scale is the way this seems to be in a rush to get done with many scenes, and just squeeze as many jokes and gags out in as short time as possible, in order to get to the next scene; American Pie mastered the art that is pacing. It was laid-back, calm and easy to get used to. This has so much stuff crammed into it in such a short amount of time that if you don't pay attention you might miss something. It also has fewer situations that you can relate to than American Pie. One thing that this film has a great amount of is re-watch value; I've seen it no less than ten times now, and I'm not the slightest bit tired of it, which is more than what I can say about American Pie. All in all, a pretty good R-rated teen comedy, but not the best. I recommend it to any fan of teen comedies. 7/10

ROAD TRIP stars Breckin Meyer as Josh Parker, a college student who accidently has a tape of him cheating on his girlfriend mailed to her. What to do? Go on a road trip with his buddies to get to the tape before it gets to her. On the way, they get into some hysterical situations and give great comedic performances. There are a lot of road movies, but this is the very best one.

The best thing about the characterizations in "Road Trip", in which a group of college pals embark on a whirlwind trip from upstate New York to Texas to prevent the hero's girlfriend from viewing an incriminating video, is that for all of the cartoonish antics of his colleagues, the hero himself seems like a regular and decent fellow.  In any movie, and certainly one of this genre, this is noteworthy indeed. The story is presented through a rather interesting and unusual device: it is recounted by one of the hero's room-mates (the one who stayed home from the trip, and is fascinated by one of the room-mates' pet boa constrictor and its feeding habits) as he conducts a campus tour for new prospective students.  This allows the story to have breaks, and for certain clarifications and asides which are generally amusing. So the hero has caught the eye of a pretty fellow student (played by Amy Smart).  Anyone who has been to college can relate to the thrill of striking up a new interesting acquaintance, and then "bumping into" them on campus as the semester progresses and a relationship takes shape; (Amy Smart would certainly be any guy's dream of such a potential relationship- she is also presented as a "regular girl", not some sex pot with a cartoon figure and wild notions of extracurricular behavior).  We believe she genuinely likes him, and is hurt when it seems that he is still involved with his childhood sweetheart, following the interlude which led to the videotaping central to the plot.  The childhood sweetheart, we are informed by the narrator, and he have made a pact to remain true to each other while they are separated at schools 1500 miles apart. The accompanying roommates are stock characters, but are not objectionable: a party boy, a pot-smoking intellectual and a baby-faced geek, whose car they need for the trip.  Some of the bits are eminently predictable: the ethnicity of the fraternity where they plan to pass themselves off as visiting members, the crude demeanor of the grandparents with whom they stay one night, and the sudden courage of the geek to stand up to his domineering father in the climatic scene. Some scenes were unnecessarily vulgar (and could have easily been adjusted to be funny instead of cruel) such as the treatment that the geek's french toast order receives when he sends it back to the kitchen, and before it is re-served to him. There are some holes in the plot, but this movie does not pretend to aspire to cinematic accolades.  No one at the "University of Austin" seemed to have any Southern accents, and money for gasoline and food (though commented upon) was never apparently a real concern. All in all, though, it was amusing, and even had a happy )and for some, I imagine) a surprising ending.  It's worth the $4 at Blockbuster.

If you were in college in the 90s or early 2000s and appreciate crude humor and a goofy movie with a basic plot you'll enjoy this. It really captures the utter freedom of college of 4 guys who go on a wacky road trip with reckless abandon. It speaks to the college experience- sex jokes, dorm room hookups, a frat, a college party, and just young college kids having fun. It was before smart phones were a thing and the main character is trying to intercept the wrong vhs tape sent in the mail. If you went on a road trip with buddies you'll relate. Some of it's way over the top, but it's just a movie.

How can I explain this movie?  IT'S HILARIOUS!!  Though you know the plot is no more than a setup for one wacky situation after another, it works and it works great.  This comedy pushes the envelope in every aspect, and smiles proudly.  Tom Green, who gets a pretty small role, is the scene-stealer. Fans of him will be very impressed.  One moment that had me almost on the floor was the French toast scene with SNL regular Horatio Sanz.  I don't want to give away any of the comedy, because that would be a sin.  Just take my word:  You will love this movie!  You will not stop laughing!  This is one trip worth taking!

I watched this movie far too much as a teenager, before i had a DVD player i only had a handful of VHS tapes. This was one of them.The story is simple, the main character Josh sleeps with a girl at a party and records it, he then accidentally posts the video to his girlfriend who lives in another state. Then the road trip begins. Josh and his 3 friends set off in a race against time to get to his girlfriend before the tape does!This film is a real American teen type of film that follows the pattern of many in that genre. It has plenty of laugh out loud moments and a very likable group of characters, (bar Tom Green)Definitely worth a watch if you have a couple of hours to kill and fancy an easy watching film with many laughs.

Hm... I don't understand what's beautiful in this vulgar movie? Why you all love it so? Yep, I agree - I'm Russian and I can't wait something like Gaidai's humor from American directors. But...When I get DVD with this movie, I thought it's good movie: I saw many of my favorite actors in titles! But when I have seen it at home I was very angry: surreal script not like Gilliam's but like Kokshenov's: nasty boys freaked out one nerd who wants to be with his favorite girl. One of boys (who have a girlfriend!) sleeps with this girls and he sent tape with sex to his real girl. Ha-ha! Very funny! There's a lot of violence and nudity film but there's no kindness in this movie. And, after all, I don't wanted to see Amy Smart's ugly breast. So, movie's terrible. I hate this film.-100/10

Road Trip is a feel-good college comedy that is both hilarious and heartfelt. The humour keeps the movie interesting and the heart keeps it from being stupid. Well, there are some stupid moments, but none of which diminish the overall result. The stupidity mainly comes from Tom Green, but who doesn't like pre-Freddy Got Fingered Tom Green?The movie starts out with Tom Green as an eighth year college student at Ithaca University giving a tour to potential students, trying to sell them the idea of attending the school. He is not doing a good job, until he tells a story of what happened the year before. This is the main part of the film:Josh Parker (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany Henderson have been best friends forever and have been boyfriend and girlfriend since they started liking the opposite sex. Josh goes to school at Ithaca and Tiffany goes to school in Austin, Texas. They try to make their long-distance relationship work, with Josh even going so far as to mail her weekly video tapes (like Skype). But Josh is tempted to get with fellow-student, Beth (Amy Smart), especially since he is somewhat of a rival for her with TA Jacob (Anthony Rapp). After a party, Josh gives in and sleeps with Beth, recording it on tape. His roommate, Rubin (Paulo Costanzo) accidentally mails the sex tape to Tiffany. This beginning of the film is hilarious, even the scene when they find out the wrong tape was mailed. So Josh, Rubin, Josh's best friend E.L. (Seann William Scott) persuade their geeky neighbour, Kyle (DJ Qualls) to take his car and retrieve the tape. The adventure portion is classic road material. They crash a party at a black fraternity, donate sperm, crash Kyle's car, among other things. Meanwhile, Tom Green awaits Rubin's snake eating a mouse and tells Beth that Tiffany is in Boston.Aside from the situations being hilarious, the characters need to be awesome too. Josh is Meyer's usual geek that he always makes work. E.L. is exactly like Stifler from American Pie. I don't mind, Stifler's awesome, E.L. could be his cousin! Rubin is a cool dude and really smart. He is awesome with physics and helps Josh pass his Ancient philosophy exam. Kyle is an ugly wimp who learns to stand up for himself. Tom Green's character's name is Barry Manilow. His obsession with seeing the snake eat the mouse is priceless. The film ends well and funnily too.You can't really say that this movie achieves the status of excellence or anything. This is about enjoying college life. It is just a simple film to make people laugh, without insulting their intelligence.3.5/4

Many reviews still rave about how hilarious this movie is. Or was. Past tense. Probably 23 years ago whole teen-packed theaters roared with laughter, but watching it now (being definitely not a teen anymore) it mainly made me chuckle now and then. But also cringe a bit. Not so much because of the sexual content, that's totally as expected, and comes (came!) with the territory of this kind of movie, fitting in the wave of sex-comedies that American Pie introduced. Although, a long and lingering scene filled with slow-motion close-ups of full frontal naked girls in a locker room actually felt like pushing the limits a bit, even for that day and age!No, the cringing was more because of the mostly lame dialogues, and because of the many jokes where the pun stayed hanging in mid-air before falling flat. And because of Tom Green, whose obnoxious character as a kind of narrator kept popping up with almost unwatchable over-acting.On the other hand, Breckin Meyer did a fine job and was totally endearing as pivotal character Josh. And I have a soft spot for Seann William Scott, of course his character in Road Trip goes way over the top again, like a blueprint of Stifler, but let's face it: nobody does that so convincing and hilariously (yes, here the word does apply!) funny!In short, a reasonably amusing roadtrip down memory lane.

Sometimes I feel guilty about watching an MPEG rip, but in this case I'm very, very glad that I didn't pay money to see this insipid reworking of Animal House / Caddyshack.  It's a joyless grind, and don't watch without an umbrella because it practically hisses and spits its contempt of you out of the screen.  There's no joy or originality in here, just cynically calculated formulaic sex-pain-gross fest.  You don't even get the feeling that it might have been fun to shoot, like American Pie.If you liked this film, well, then I hope you paid money to see it.  You deserve to get screwed.

ROAD TRIP is a movie with well focused hilarity from start to finish.  It is raunchy and wonderful, capturing college days with a light hearted frivolity that really tickled me so that I felt sick from laughing.  The New York Times critic reviewed it on Friday, May 19th and said it much better than I can.  He also loved the movie and found it very appealing, although neither of us is the age of the target audience, I suspect.  I am 64 and love comedies.  The sex and comedy is not at all offensive to viewers who have a well developed sense of humor. Sure, the serious and critical audience who love to find fault with any comedic effort will turn their noses up at this film. I do not recommend that they see this superb comedy.  Tom Green is not the central character but he is very good in his role. The other cast members may not be well known but after this film it's just a matter of time before they are leading stars. All of the casting is just perfect. Photography and music are excellent. If this is the first of the quality that Montecito Pictures will produce they are a studio to follow in the future.  Go see this film.  Buy a box of popcorn and a Coke.  Be careful not to choke on the popcorn from uncontrollable laughter.  Take a long, hard swallow of the Coke and calm down.  You will remember this evening for years!
