21 is definitely the major film for the spring time, it has young hot actors, including an incredible academy award winner, Kevin Spacey, and another great actor who's head looks like it grew quite a bit bigger, Lawarence Fishburne. So it has all the key ingredients for a good movie, a decent plot, over all a good combination of actors, and looks like a well put together movie. So I saw it this weekend and I have to say that I was a little disappointed, I think this movie was more for the teenagers, with the actors and the rating, I think it should've been more adult. It was a typical rise and fall story with cliché'd characters. Kevin Spacey, seriously my favorite actor, he's always a dead on hit with every role he takes on, but he seemed to just sleep his way through the film and didn't really care about it. He and new and hot up-comer, Jim Sturgess were not a bad couple on screen, but were not strong enough to hold the story into something original.Basically we have Ben Campbell who needs $300,000 for Harvard Med. School, he's extremely gifted with numbers, so when his professor, Micky Rosa notices his gifts, he invites Ben with a group of his other students to go to Vegas and play 21. But there is a way to beat the game apparently, by counting cards. Ben promises up and down that it is just for school, but of course when he gets so hot, he takes it way further and ends up making a huge mistake and gets caught with some nasty security guards you don't wanna mess with.Now 21 has decent enough acting, the movie itself is decent, I didn't mind at all watching it. For the most part, it's the young group of students that keep the movie interesting and keeps your attention. My main problems are for example about the characters Ben and Jill hooking up, I seriously doubt that would happen for real, but for the movie, they want these two hotties to get together at least for the teenage audience's sake. Also supposedly the group says they have to stay on the down low in Vegas so they don't get caught, yet they go around Vegas buying all these new clothes, clubbing, drinking, etc. 21 is worth the watch, but to be honest, if you're reading this, wait for the rental, it's just a regular rise and fall story.6/10

Let me begin by saying that I haven't read the book this movie is "based on" so I went in with no pre-conceived expectations. I enjoyed the movie, it was definitely worth a night at the movies however, I had some major issues with it that really detracted from my viewing enjoyment and yes, I know it's just a movie, but when things occur in a movie that's based on actual events that yank me out of the flow of the plot that's a problem. Things that jumped out at me were; The main character is supposed to be a genius and yet he hides over $300,000 in his ceiling?? No one is that stupid. Especially since there was no need for him to hide it at all; he won it gambling in Vegas, where gambling is legal, hello? He would have had to pay taxes on it but all he had to do was declare it as gambling winnings and open a bank account, or better yet, a short term CD to earn some interest. What did he plan to do, drop $300,000 in cash on the Dean of Admissions desk at Harvard Medical School? That would have gotten the IRS down on him in a heartbeat. It just didn't make any sense and was an incredibly stupid and unbelievable move.The group was counting cards which is not illegal but will get you banned from any casino that catches you. I would think they would have wanted to keep a very very low profile so they didn't attract attention. Wasn't that why they wore disguises? And yet, they stayed in suites, walked into the casinos greeting everyone by name like high rollers, they did everything they possibly could TO call attention to themselves. Again, it just didn't make any sense.Vegas casino's are all owned by major corporations these days, the days of the mob running the casinos are long over. Casino security does not beat people up over counting cards anymore, they haven't for a very long time. They escort you off the property and ban you and that's all. The main character could have filed a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission (because again, he hadn't done anything illegal), and the casino would have had a lot of questions to answer.The main character's mother offers him a check for $68,000 for medical school, telling him that she's been saving it for years for him so he could go to medical school. So she obviously didn't pay for MIT if she's been saving for years for this, how did he pay for MIT? I assumed he'd gotten scholarships but they never tell you one way or the other.Kevin Spacey's character steals his money and is going to see that he doesn't graduate, huh? Again, the main character hasn't done anything illegal, other than not declaring his winnings and paying taxes on them. On the other hand, I can't help feeling that the powers that be at MIT would take a very dim view of one of their professors acting the way Spacey's character did. All our hero had to do was go to them and spill his guts, I'm sure he could have gotten at least one or two of the others to back him up, probably the guy Spacey had already bounced from the team. He also could have gone to the police and reported the theft of the money in his room, OK, so he would have been in a little hot water with the IRS, but he would have kept at least a large portion of the cash.Casinos don't usually comp luxury suites to big winners, more often to big losers so they'll keep coming back. They want the big winners to go elsewhere. And we're back to the low profile thing again.There are a great many casino's in Vegas, if your trying to get away with counting, why would you go back to the same one (the Hardrock) again and again? Those are just the ones that come to mind at the moment. Again, I did enjoy the movie, but my enjoyment was tempered by the things I've listed above that were, in the end, kind of an insult to the viewers intelligence.

Slick camera work and some good performances rev up the technical quality of this fact-based story about a 21 year old MIT student named Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) who, along with his brainy Ivy League chums, travels to Vegas to win tons of money at the blackjack tables. Their sleazy math professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), leads the group. Rosa has devised an elaborate and conspiratorial card counting scheme that consists of code words and hand gestures. With all that preparation, the group's scheme does work ... for a while. And in the process, the shy, cautious Ben, who only wants the money for tuition costs, morphs into his alter ego, a person quite unlike his original self.The film's pace starts off leisurely, then alternates between fast-paced Vegas casino action and periods of downtime wherein Ben and his girlfriend, fellow conspirator Jill (Kate Bosworth), talk shop and take in the high life. The story does have a villain, but it may not be who you think it is.The script's dialogue is snappy and hip, and contains minimal tech jargon. "Variable change" is one such math term, and it has thematic implications toward the end, as the story twists and turns in ways that may surprise you. And "winner winner, chicken dinner" is the group's lingo for gambling success.Production design is realistic and lavish; this is a big budget film. Color cinematography, by DP Russell Carpenter, is polished and slick. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and close-ups. The best parts of the film are the close-ups of the characters at the blackjack tables. Film editing coincides with plot pacing, and ranges from slow to super fast. Acting is all-around good. Kevin Spacey gives his usual topnotch acting job; Sturgess and Bosworth also give fine performances.It's not a perfect film. Background music was noisy and rather nondescript for my taste. And I could have wished for more card playing, and less time spent on Ben's college buddies in the first Act; the result is that the film gets off to a slow start. Still, the script is credible, and stays close to its book source "Bringing Down The House" by Ben Mezrich.Thematically relevant in today's world of greed and materialism, "21" is a terrific film, one that has greater import than other films, because the events in "21" really happened. And the fine performances and polished visuals enhance the overall look and feel, to create a film that is both engaging and entertaining.

21 is worth seeing on a restless Friday or Saturday night with friends, but it isn't anything more than that. The film features nice performances from actors Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne, as well as nice entries from the lesser known ensemble.However, it doesn't take a film expert to notice some of the more...awful lines. "That's is impressive software."...come on, seriously? Just bad writing.And the flow of the plot is painfully cliché, up until the end where things are admittedly pretty unpredictable. The ending was unexpected, but it worked and made up for earlier plot points that were predictable."21" is entertaining, that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

The true story of six MIT kids who try to fleece Vegas is embellished to say the least in "21." There's lots of added drama, a heap of unintentional campiness, plot twists you can see coming down the Strip, and a love story thrown in for the hell of it. This flick was made for the MTV set...the mechanics of how these kids actually count cards to beat the system is explained quickly but not well. I'm probably an idiot (and I haven't read the book upon which the movie is based) but I still don't get it. This movie makes the "how" not really matter anyway. Why explain boring old math when you can have montages of our ethnically diverse group of spoiled geniuses bar hopping and shopping at Louis Vuitton? If you've seen the trailers than you know 21...there are no surprises here. There is a long running time that makes the last 30 minutes of the film agonizing. There's a few ham-fisted plot twists and double crosses and I kept expecting the movie to end...then WHAM, another scene of our lead character back at the tables in a cheesy disguise and more slow motion shots of the dealer flipping cards.Sturgess is barely passable as Ben...he doesn't quite have the magnetism to pull off the various emotional shadings required of the role. There are parts where he underplays emotion and parts where he overplays them...he never really finds a medium. "21" would have been great ten years ago; give me Giovanni Ribisi in the Ben role and you have something cooking. But Sturgess is pretty blah...so is Kate Bosworth, who looks a lot like Priscilla Presley and nothing like a college student. The only two actors worth a damn here are Spacey, the acerbic ringleader of the young card counters, and the underused Jacob Pitts, who helps recruit Ben into the group.21 does well to show the all-night-long decadence of Vegas, and there are some beautiful shots of the Strip at night. Otherwise the flick is by-the-numbers garbage.

Considering the risky pleasure generally associated with gambling and the seductive thrill of watching a heist or scam unfold, it should come as no surprise that 21, a film which combines the two aforementioned premises should excel at being enjoyable. And while the film may be very familiar ground to anyone with in any experience with Ocean's Eleven style crime capers, and the majority of the film's plot points verge on being almost laughably predictable, it is executed with enough exuberant flair to make it worthwhile in the midst of its formula. A slow start gives the necessary exposition as to how a thoroughly ethical young MIT student (Sturgess)'s desperate need for money to attend Harvard medical school leads him to join a team of mathematical geniuses trained in blackjack card counting who routinely rip off Las Vegas casinos during weekends between class. However, this opening proves overlong, overly predictable, and largely unnecessary, dragging far too much before plunging into the film's real fun as Sturgess and his team are engulfed by the seductive glamour of Vegas and the thrill of the huge monetary takes. Some judicious editing, clearing away such unnecessary subplots (such as a robotics competition with Sturgess' tiresomely stereotypical nerdy friends) could have resulted in a far more streamlined and faster paced film. Some viewers may take offence to the "Hollywoodizing" of the MIT team, with team members of different ethnicity largely shoved to the background in favour of the typically gorgeous Caucasian leads, a disconcertingly common practice in modern day cinema. However, the flashy MTV style cinematography and editing ably capture the engrossing spectacle of Vegas, and once the film gets going, it would be difficult to deny the sheer enjoyment of being swept up in the heady rush of quick wealth and all of its hedonistic trappings.The film's quality cast add credulity to the frequently underwritten characters they portray. Jim Sturgess once again impresses as the ethical math prodigy slowly corrupted by a world of superficial glamour, his endearing charm putting an intriguing enough take on the "troubled but well meaning hero" archetype. As one might expect, Kevin Spacey effortlessly steals the show as the charismatic but ruthless professor managing the MIT card counting team, and Spacey's easygoing yet commanding presence is a profound boost to the film. Kate Bosworth contributes a typically flat performance, but given her token 'inevitable love interest' role, she fails to detract much from the film's overall quality. Lawrence Fishburne adds class, much needed dramatic weight and moments of grim humour to his antagonistic burly head of casino security, gradually catching on to the MIT team's scamming.While the age old adage of 'style over substance' certainly holds true here, 21 may essentially epitomize the modern Hollywood crime caper film, but the formula hasn't quite run dry enough to overly detract from the enjoyment factor. The film's snappy visuals and strong casting are mostly enough to make up for a largely uninspired and frequently weak script. However, fans of similar works will not be disappointed, and for those willing to forgive the film's frequent delving into the wells of convention and accept entertainment over profundity, 21 should prove an ideal watch.-7/10

This film screened at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. It is a reasonable well-made based-on-a-true-story film that tells the story of a group of MIT students who attempt to make a fortune counting cards in Vegas. The screenplay apparently plays pretty fast-and-loose with the version told in the book. Never-the-less, the acting is excellent - especially Jim Sturgess in the role of the lead student. Honestly, his accent was so good that I didn't realize - until he came on stage afterward - that he was British. He does a great job with the mannerisms to give you a real sense of the character's evolution. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are solid - although Fishburne's role is fairly small. The minor characters are not as well-developed as they could have been. The cinematography of both Boston and Las Vegas is quite good, especially on the big screen. It's an interesting story, but they could have edited down a bit to make it move a little quicker. This is a good film, but it probably could have been a lot better.

21 is a movie about game, money and greed and also about how someone can lose his self control when it's all about making "easy money" In the materialistic world we live nowadays money is the center of many things, even those which were supposed to have nothing to do with it, like love or friendship; so making "easy money" is a real temptation even if you have to lie, forget your old friends or to do schemes to achieve it! The main character of this movie can tell it very wellIt's a nice movie about this subject and it shows us the frightening world of Las Vegas casinos'. The plot is quite interesting and appealing and the cast is also good. I score it 7/10.

"21" was the official Opening Night Film of the 2008 SXSW Film Festival. The film is based on the true story of a group of MIT students who use their math skills to "beat the house" at blackjack in the Las Vegas casinos. Robert Luketic ("Legally Blonde") directed the Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb adaptation of Ben Mezrich's bestselling book "Bringing Down the House.""21" is pure Hollywood all the way -- slick and polished, like the wardrobes and personalities inhabited by the kids in their transformation to high rollers. The tight ensemble cast includes Kate Bosworth and Jacob Pitts as team players and Laurence Fishburne as a security chief with a massive dilemma on his hands. But the show belongs to Kevin Spacey as professor Mickey Rosa, mastermind behind the escapade, and Jim Sturgess as Ben Campbell, the reluctant recruit who drives the film as it barrels headlong to a breathless climax.The script is clever, funny, and worthy of math geeks everywhere, and the widescreen action is as nonstop as that on the casino floor. Spacey is Spacey at his best -- just the Kevin we know, nothing more, nothing less -- and that's good enough. Sturgess, a Brit playing an American here (quite well, by the way), proves that he is destined for stardom in the States.In the intro to the screening, Luketic explained how Spacey had bought the rights to Mezrich's book, leading to his having to fight to win the actor over and let him direct the film. Memo to Kevin: thank you. And, whatever you do, wait for the end credits. The stunning remix of the Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want" is almost worth the price of admission.

I enjoyed the movie because it was entertaining all the way. It was slick and had interesting characters. The only problem was the last half of it where credibility when flying out the window. The movie is all about supposedly very intelligent people, led by the smartest of the all the group, the only veteran in this college age-dominated cast: "Professor Mickey Rosa," played by Kevin Spacey. Well, Rosa would not do what he did here, for starters, meaning trusting an untrustworthy and revenge-seeking kid. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. The others in the group wouldn't go along with the renegade - "Ben Campbell" (Jim Sturgess) - either. There is no way this kid is going to totally outsmart the professor, but it makes for good Hollywood dramatics.There are a bunch of other holes, too, such as wanting to be anonymous but going back to the same place; a ridiculous chase scene through the casino gambling area and kitchen; hand signals that a junior detective could see (and are never changed!) and - maybe the worst - winning tons of money in sessions. Nobody with half a brain would win much at any session, because it draws attention. You win a little here, a little there and go from place-to-place and remain anonymous. This movie is based on a true story, and I can guarantee you that's what the MIT students did in real life - not what you see here.Still, facts aside, it's still a fun movie to watch and since entertainment is the name of the game with films, it succeeds and I still give it an "8" star rating for that. At no time was I bored and overly insulted at the dumbness that I would have stopped playing the DVD. It will hold your interest and you'll be thoroughly entertained, especially if you don't know a lot about blackjack and how casinos operate.Oh, as a postscript: they don't beat up "card counters" in back rooms of casinos. If they think you are counting cards, which I don't believe is illegal, they still have the right to kick you out of their establishment.....but they ask you nicely and you are removed from the floor with no big scene or violence. They have your picture, there are security people everywhere, and you aren't allowed back.So, enjoy the film but don't believe the screenplay.

A great young cast tell a whirlwind story that zips in places, but drags slightly in others. Kevin Spacey steals the show as the mastermind behind the MIT card-counting team (who are all remarkably glamorous - wonder if they were in real life?) The cinematography captured the bright lights of Vegas particularly well and the sheer fun and excitement of what they were doing was well communicated to the audience. It plays the twists and turns in a similar way to the Ocean's series and there was a flavour of those here. My 12 year-old son thought it was great and although there were some adult themes it was played in an easy-going harmless style.

After Reading Ben Mezrich's "Bringing Down the House", upon which this movie is based, I was excited to the movie. I am usually let down by movies that are based on books, but that was not the case this time.Although there were a handful of cliché parts of the movie, all in all it was excellently done. The visual effects were well done, and the acting on the part of Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, and Kate Bosworth, was exemplary. Some people may criticize Spacey for his 'gusto', but I believe his portrayal of Mickey was stellar.The movie had suspense, a solid plot line, scattered funny scenes, and a good ending. The people I went with, none of whom had read the book, found it an even better movie than I did. If you like the movie enough, I recommend reading the book for a more complete story.

The movie was good but awfully familiar....In fact, living in Canada, there was a film called "The Last Casino" starting Charles Martin Smith as a University Professor who assembled a team of his brighter students and taught them how to count cards playing Black Jack. While certainly there were differences between the two films, I couldn't help but get the feeling I'd seen it all before. I did enjoy the acting of Jim Sturgess as the main character, and Kevin Spacey was chillingly evil. Kate Bosworth was good, but mostly eye candy. Laurence Fishburne had a good role as a Security consultant at the casino. I have to admit, the scenes where Jim Sturgess was showing his mind worked while counting the cards was ingenious. It gave the feeling that everything was slowed down and he could interpret the cards in a leisurely fashion, while in fact it was probably happening at break neck speed. The ending was satisfying.

This movie was based on a true story, and if the makers had stuck closer to the true story it could have been a much better movie. But no, they had to Hollywoodize it and dumb it down so that anyone with the least knowledge of the game of blackjack and how casinos operate will be saying "No way" to themselves all through the movie. It actually ends up with a chase scene and characters running through the kitchen, for God's sake.In real life the team's success was 90% in being careful to not attract the attention of the casinos detectors and only 10% in their scheme, which was based on the well-known technique of card-counting to get an edge. In the movie, the team's actions were childishly crude even to the point of continually returning to the same casino...so the movie makers could develop the characters of the casino bad guys. In real life the team was careful to not win much at any one table or at any one casino, not more than $1,000 a session, which would be well within the amount any lucky player might win without counting. In the movie they hit the same table for tens of thousands of dollars, which would have set off alarms all over Nevada. Even the hand signals the team used in the movie were childishly obvious. All this by the supposedly brilliant MIT students and professor. No way.The movie actually had the bad casino guys torturing card counters when they caught them. No way. In real life a casino has the right, tested in court, to kick anyone out and ban them from ever playing again...they do not have to prove cheating or card-counting, they do it under the laws of trespassing on their private property and this is what they do. Remember, card-counters are only making what amounts to an hourly wage, so they are not a serious threat to a casino.Another example of the Hollywood treatment was that after showing how brilliant Ben was at counting cards when they were recruiting him, he was not used as the card counter, he was used as the big bettor and one of the female team members did the counting.an entertaining movie for someone not knowledgeable or much interested in real life casino gambling, but dumb and dumber for those who are.

Warning - may contain spoilers.I will make this very brief.Kevin Spacey... shame on you for accepting such a role.The movie was below the passing line and I would not watch it again on my deathbed if it meant it would keep me alive.What the screenwriters may have not kept in mind is that many of the viewers, those who would actually go and see the movie, may not have read the book or know of all the juicy details that have been left out of the movie. I had to figure out what the count of cards was on my own. It felt nice to have to use your brain a little to figure something out, but as I was reading other posts (comments) I learned that what I had figured out on my own was very primitive and much more elaboration would have made things clearer and given the movie a little more edge - although its pretty round edged to me.Why would the MIT professor be so cruel and mean and cold, to the point that he had to call the casino security which results in the beating of one of his "brilliant" students who had made him tons of money.How could that same professor so quickly be convinced in a scene of about 1 min and 45 seconds to go back to the table and play a "last round" with the same student he had screwed over and so openly called as a cunning genius... Did this professor lack intellect? This made no sense what so ever and was very unbelievable as something that a rational person would do.One thing to admit, the final twists were unpredictable.. but by that point I had already developed my own mind about the movie... Big fat failure. I'm ashamed I wasted my time watching it. I thought it would be good... I guess the next time I see spacey in a movie, I wont be able to take the movie off the shelf without questions asked as I once did...

"21" follows the rise (and ultimate fall, and what happens afterward) of a college math wiz recruited by his professor to outwit the blackjack tables at Las Vegas and make a ton of money. It's a well made movie with lots of class and style, and if you aren't turned off by the notion of filthy lucre, then you are bound to enjoy this.The movie works well because of its cast. Jim Sturgess, the young male lead, is outstanding. He does a great job of transitioning from initial uncertainty to eventual acceptance and ultimately relishing his new "career." He's eminently likable and you can't help pulling for him all the way.Kate Bosworth is lovely as his love interest, always impeccably polished. She looks a bit old for the part of a college student, and especially her style of clothing in the casinos (while ravishing) is not quite right for a 21-year old. I wish more buildup had been devoted to her relationship with Sturgess, but the movie is all told from his angle. Best of all, Kevin Spacey is dead-on as the ringleader. He is cool, efficient, very sharp with every line. As always, he always manages to steal every scene he is in.There is also a nice subplot about these aging casino security agents, who are being phased out in favor of software recognition systems. It gives the movie more depth and interest, and ultimately you can't help realizing that these guys, while "villains" in one sense, are also "heroes" in another.The look of the film is fabulous, well worth consideration for art direction. It's all about Vegas, but not over the top, somehow. You never blame the character for falling into the trap, because it is all so addictive: the cash, the clothes, the fabulous rooms (it's almost worth seeing the movie just to see those penthouse suites!). The editing and camera work are awesome. They did an especially good job zooming way in on the cards, to where they almost become characters in the story. But it never gets technical, it never dwells on splitting 8's or hitting a soft 17 or anything like that. Even if you know nothing about the game (and I know very little), it won't impair your enjoyment of the movie.It's not a very deep movie, but it does have insight into human character and motivation. It's mainly just a lot of fun to watch. I give it a solid 8 (maybe shading towards 8-1/2).

I suppose the first time I saw a preview for 21 was probably close to 7 months ago, so I did know there was a film coming out and it looked fairly interesting. Since I am getting around the age of being able to gamble and go to vegas, it was nice being able to see the scene of vegas in an up-to-date movie! I love the characters, and im sorry the Asian kid.. haha all I could think of was disturbia ringtone.. HAHA!I loved the way Kevin Spacey played the whole good guy, bad guy role.. It was nice seeing him in a role like this, simply because I relate him back to Pay it Forward, and I believe that this is a great role for his personality. The main character does a great job really showing the struggles that college students do face everyday. Though most of us cannot say that we have a 4.0 at MIT and are awaiting money to attend Harvard, I can personally relate to the financial struggle college does bring to myself personally. Maybe I should go card count!??Once you started to pay attention I really began figuring out the true meaning behind card counting and it really is very simple, with the word connection to the card value. As for the gestures, they were a big out there, and I really think that Vegas PD would catch on to the whole arm behind the back thing 10 times quicker, simply because it is such a drastic move. The movie is great, and I personally loved it because it played out the roles of each of the characters and came to a conclusion with all of them. Sorry, but it was nice seeing what happened to Spacey at the end. :]7 out of 10! Go see this film!

21 had huge plot holes, (why did Cole, the casino man, send his henchmen after Ben if they were actually working together all along?) it had terrible morals, (at the end it turns out that the whole gang will keep cheating anyway), the acting was choppy, and it glamorized Vegas, casinos and strip clubs like they're the best things in the world. Please don't see this movie, because if its successful, they'll make a sequel or a remake or something, and the movie fans of the world deserve better than this rubbish. And in case I wasn't clear, it isn't terrible as a film but it had evil morals. Don't don't don't don't don't see it, I made the mistake of going, don't make that mistake.

This film has a youthful enthusiasm which is infectious and a young cast that pulls off the infection. It is done Hollywood Flashback style in that it starts after everything happens, goes to back to how it happens and then ends by going back to the beginning.Overall, sadly, it obviously spent a lot of money in production but tries to simplify things a bit too much. While it is entertaining, it is much too simplified to interest the serious gambler. The appeal here is in telling the story in a light mood, interesting a young audience, and entertaining it. In that sense it succeeds though not on quite the stylish ease that a movie like "The Sting" did. Of course that one was a best picture. This one is not.AS I have not read the novel, I am not sure what liberties were taken from the true story but my feeling is that the true story here is a better tale than the movie one. That being said, as I put my brain away & look for light fare, this one fills the bill quite nicely. Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, and the rest of the cast do quite fine in going through a not too serious treatment.I have seen worse, & better films than this one.

In this exuberant, smart and fast-paced drama/comedy, there is no denying that you can't have fun watching a hard working, but financially struggling kid, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) become seduced by the wily king of card-counting Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey). It is good to have thrown in such a veteran actor like Spacey into a mix of new comers like Campbell, Kate Bosworth or Aaron Yoo. Also Spacy produced the film, based on Ben Mezrich's autobiographical novel "Bringing Down The House" which chronicles the uprising and downfall of the group of card-counters. Campbell is a hard-working kid that uses his intellect to arouse the attention of his mathematics teacher, who just happens to be the leader of a group of intelligent cheaters who go to Las Vegas every weekend to, well, count-cards. At first Campbell is skeptical in taking part in such an activity, with a history as unnerving as it is, but being informed that there is no danger and it is not at all illegal, he rethinks, because in order to get into Harvard Med, he needs 300,000$. Mickey informs him that within a month of joining them on their escapades, he will have the money easily. The humor is spread through the film, the dramatic elements are the dangers that the weary kid faces, being Casinoss what they are with security, and the serious points about what greed and desire do to you. Campbell said he was only in for the money he needed to get into Harvard, but it is harder to stop then he thinks. That is why Spacey's role as Mickey is so important, the mentor is both guiding them on the table, and off the table. He was more right about Vegas then anyone. Director Robert Luketic's trip from chick flicks like "Legally Blonde" and "Monster-In-Law" to this was quite a voyage, but there is a sub-text that remains true to his conception that 'the law is the law, and heck if were gonna break it...'. And the lead protagonist in this film really developed from the quiet, geeky kid to the partying and greedy monster that Vegas spawned was a very down-hill, bumpy trip that would land him right back to the drawing board, but the end is one that came to no surprise, but to my regret, I can't tell you just yet. See it yourself, it was a fun trip. Funny.

I was lucky enough to see this film for free at a special screening in greater London as part of a market research by the film industry. even though it was free i would have paid good money to see that film. but I was presently surprised about how good the film was and everyone seemed to agree that the film was really good. I thought it made the card playing parts actually riveting even though i am not a card player myself. i thought the acting performances were all good especially that of Kevin Spacey's. In terms of the story. In many ways it reminded me of all the good things that was in the BBC TV show hustle. But in a much more real way. On the down side, you may see the ending coming and there is a romance part of the film that feels unnecessary. However it is a very slick film that gets away with it. I would say that it clearly the best film in this genre of film. I enjoyed it more than films such as Confidence and the Oceans 11 type films. I would highly recommend it to anybody when it eventually comes out in April!! I would have thought that they would cut down and re-edit it a bit on the basis that it was quite long. however it kept my attention for the whole film and that is not something that is also done during these sorts of films

21 certainly won't go into my books as the most intelligent or deep movie I've ever seen, in fact as far as Hollywood films go 21 is about as shallow as they come. They stack the cast with some big names, flashy romance, the latest fad...in this case cards...Blackjack to be exact, and people will come out in droves to see it. Now there was a Canadian made film about this same story entitled "The Last Casino" (see my review) and if you ever get a chance to see it definitely check it out because it's one of the better Canadian movies I've seen and it also actually is much smarter and more artistic than 21 but tells the nearly identical story. Still 21 has some key elements going for it including a new hot lead actor that is very talented, a big budget, fun with cards, a half decent story and a little romance thrown in to boot. It just won't have you walking away feeling any smarter or better about life and that's okay as long as it entertains.Latest It Boy Jim Sturgess following his success in Across The Universe plays math genius Ben Campbell. Sturgess has this definite quality about him that I predict will make him an absolute star and big movies like this definitely help and he already has a recognizable face. He is very energetic and really shines on screen and he is just someone you relate to and can watch him in this adventure plus he gets to show some emotion and probably the only character with depth in the film. Kevin Spacey is the powerhouse of the film or at least he's supposed to be. I mean in all fairness he does well as the leader of their gambling group and a University professor but he doesn't do as much with the part as I would have thought. He doesn't really grip you as much as he could have considering the man can act and is a legend in his own right. Kate Bosworth is lovely but in all honestly I found her downright boring in this film. She does little to nothing other than look cute and be a romantic interest for Sturgess' character which I thought the entire romance felt forced anyways although they had decent chemistry. Fellow team members Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira are practically non existent as the entire film focuses almost entirely on the three of the main big actors which is unfortunate for them. Someone who does stand out from the rest though is larger than life Laurence Fishburne as an aging security agent for Casinos. He is really great in the role and makes an awesome anti-hero to the story.The cast is decent although no one really is mind blowing but that could be because of the rather lack luster script. You know a twist is coming and you're trying to figure it out as you go but even if you don't figure it out the twist doesn't really shock you or anything. Basically what I am saying is that millions will see 21 and probably enjoy it and I don't disagree with them. The film is fun but it's just not something that will stick with you for very long. It's Hollywood fodder made to make money and it will likely do that but don't expect it to be a time lasting classic or anything. But check it out and see for yourself. 7/10

I had the really cool opportunity to see an advance screening of "21" tonight. Having read the book when it first came out, I was a bit skeptical about whether it would translate well. I couldn't have been more pleased. Was it the same as the book? Of course not (except for The Green Mile, what was?) But it was action-packed, smart, fun, well-acted, well-directed, and just plain enjoyable. Spacey, Fishburne, and Bosworth are at the top of their games and Jim Sturgess is going to be a star. The visuals were great, the editing sharp, and the score right on point. I don't know whether to stay up all night re-reading the book or hop on a plane for Las Vegas to try to win while I still halfway remember the counting system. I enjoyed this as much as any light fare I have seen in a long time. I love George Clooney, but "21" is an order of magnitude better than any of the "Oceans" movies.

Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is a MIT math major looking to get into Harvard School of Medicine. He comes from a poor family and needs to dazzle for a full scholarship. Ben impressed his professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) and is introduced to the professor's secret club. Along with Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts), they hone their card counting skills to beat the casinos at blackjack. It's a great ride until casino pit boss Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) catches him.The premise is interesting. The movie depends on Jim Sturgess and where the movie chose to concentrate on. I'm not thrill about the romance being glued on to this. It feels ill-fitting. If there is one compelling relationship, it should be Ben and the professor. This could have been a great dark character study. Instead it tries to be flashy and cool. The romance drains the edginess out of the movie. Also it would be more compelling to have Ben start off as a more introverted loner. It would allow more room for the character growth and some possible father issues.

I was intrigued by the preview of 21 because I'm a sucker for films about gambling, and this is a film about gambling ~ it's the director/writers gambling with our intelligence, hoping we're completely devoid of brainpower, which would make us stupid enough to buy any of the claptrap we see on screen in this bonafide turkey.The beginning is good, it's only when the true fun should be starting - when Ben starts going to Vegas as part of the blackjack team headed by Micky (Kevin Spacey) - that the movie begins to seriously fall apart.Vegas is a huge town, with literally hundreds of casinos, but these clowns wind up going back to the SAME casino, over and over, using the SAME signals to one another (their ridiculous signal to indicate a hot table, for instance), until it's more than blatantly obvious to the security overseer, Laurence Fishburne, that these stooges are playing a very dangerous - and stupid - game.The story then continues on its deathtrail of stupidity, with the storyline and the characters' behavior becoming more and more ridiculous until Ben - duhhhh - loses Everything and has to - double duhhhh - find a way to outsmart Micky (a 2-year-old could outsmart this guy) and get his life back together. The way it's done is even stupider than what proceeds it, what with Ben luring Micky back to the SAME casino for one last shot at the Big Money. "They'll know us there," Micky says, "So we'll have to wear disguises." Oh yeah, genius - a cowboy hat and fake mustache really make Spacey look like a totally different person (not), and even stupider --- they show up using the SAME signals that they've used all along; yes, these giboneys are that dumb.Then, to insult the audience even further, the writers tack on what they believe, in their deluded states, to be a double surprise ending. By this time, the only surprise is that anyone is still left in the movie theatre.

21 is definitely the major film for the spring time, it has young hot actors, including an incredible academy award winner, Kevin Spacey, and another great actor who's head looks like it grew quite a bit bigger, Lawarence Fishburne. So it has all the key ingredients for a good movie, a decent plot, over all a good combination of actors, and looks like a well put together movie. So I saw it this weekend and I have to say that I was a little disappointed, I think this movie was more for the teenagers, with the actors and the rating, I think it should've been more adult. It was a typical rise and fall story with cliché'd characters. Kevin Spacey, seriously my favorite actor, he's always a dead on hit with every role he takes on, but he seemed to just sleep his way through the film and didn't really care about it. He and new and hot up-comer, Jim Sturgess were not a bad couple on screen, but were not strong enough to hold the story into something original.Basically we have Ben Campbell who needs $300,000 for Harvard Med. School, he's extremely gifted with numbers, so when his professor, Micky Rosa notices his gifts, he invites Ben with a group of his other students to go to Vegas and play 21. But there is a way to beat the game apparently, by counting cards. Ben promises up and down that it is just for school, but of course when he gets so hot, he takes it way further and ends up making a huge mistake and gets caught with some nasty security guards you don't wanna mess with.Now 21 has decent enough acting, the movie itself is decent, I didn't mind at all watching it. For the most part, it's the young group of students that keep the movie interesting and keeps your attention. My main problems are for example about the characters Ben and Jill hooking up, I seriously doubt that would happen for real, but for the movie, they want these two hotties to get together at least for the teenage audience's sake. Also supposedly the group says they have to stay on the down low in Vegas so they don't get caught, yet they go around Vegas buying all these new clothes, clubbing, drinking, etc. 21 is worth the watch, but to be honest, if you're reading this, wait for the rental, it's just a regular rise and fall story.6/10

Let me begin by saying that I haven't read the book this movie is "based on" so I went in with no pre-conceived expectations. I enjoyed the movie, it was definitely worth a night at the movies however, I had some major issues with it that really detracted from my viewing enjoyment and yes, I know it's just a movie, but when things occur in a movie that's based on actual events that yank me out of the flow of the plot that's a problem. Things that jumped out at me were; The main character is supposed to be a genius and yet he hides over $300,000 in his ceiling?? No one is that stupid. Especially since there was no need for him to hide it at all; he won it gambling in Vegas, where gambling is legal, hello? He would have had to pay taxes on it but all he had to do was declare it as gambling winnings and open a bank account, or better yet, a short term CD to earn some interest. What did he plan to do, drop $300,000 in cash on the Dean of Admissions desk at Harvard Medical School? That would have gotten the IRS down on him in a heartbeat. It just didn't make any sense and was an incredibly stupid and unbelievable move.The group was counting cards which is not illegal but will get you banned from any casino that catches you. I would think they would have wanted to keep a very very low profile so they didn't attract attention. Wasn't that why they wore disguises? And yet, they stayed in suites, walked into the casinos greeting everyone by name like high rollers, they did everything they possibly could TO call attention to themselves. Again, it just didn't make any sense.Vegas casino's are all owned by major corporations these days, the days of the mob running the casinos are long over. Casino security does not beat people up over counting cards anymore, they haven't for a very long time. They escort you off the property and ban you and that's all. The main character could have filed a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission (because again, he hadn't done anything illegal), and the casino would have had a lot of questions to answer.The main character's mother offers him a check for $68,000 for medical school, telling him that she's been saving it for years for him so he could go to medical school. So she obviously didn't pay for MIT if she's been saving for years for this, how did he pay for MIT? I assumed he'd gotten scholarships but they never tell you one way or the other.Kevin Spacey's character steals his money and is going to see that he doesn't graduate, huh? Again, the main character hasn't done anything illegal, other than not declaring his winnings and paying taxes on them. On the other hand, I can't help feeling that the powers that be at MIT would take a very dim view of one of their professors acting the way Spacey's character did. All our hero had to do was go to them and spill his guts, I'm sure he could have gotten at least one or two of the others to back him up, probably the guy Spacey had already bounced from the team. He also could have gone to the police and reported the theft of the money in his room, OK, so he would have been in a little hot water with the IRS, but he would have kept at least a large portion of the cash.Casinos don't usually comp luxury suites to big winners, more often to big losers so they'll keep coming back. They want the big winners to go elsewhere. And we're back to the low profile thing again.There are a great many casino's in Vegas, if your trying to get away with counting, why would you go back to the same one (the Hardrock) again and again? Those are just the ones that come to mind at the moment. Again, I did enjoy the movie, but my enjoyment was tempered by the things I've listed above that were, in the end, kind of an insult to the viewers intelligence.

Slick camera work and some good performances rev up the technical quality of this fact-based story about a 21 year old MIT student named Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) who, along with his brainy Ivy League chums, travels to Vegas to win tons of money at the blackjack tables. Their sleazy math professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), leads the group. Rosa has devised an elaborate and conspiratorial card counting scheme that consists of code words and hand gestures. With all that preparation, the group's scheme does work ... for a while. And in the process, the shy, cautious Ben, who only wants the money for tuition costs, morphs into his alter ego, a person quite unlike his original self.The film's pace starts off leisurely, then alternates between fast-paced Vegas casino action and periods of downtime wherein Ben and his girlfriend, fellow conspirator Jill (Kate Bosworth), talk shop and take in the high life. The story does have a villain, but it may not be who you think it is.The script's dialogue is snappy and hip, and contains minimal tech jargon. "Variable change" is one such math term, and it has thematic implications toward the end, as the story twists and turns in ways that may surprise you. And "winner winner, chicken dinner" is the group's lingo for gambling success.Production design is realistic and lavish; this is a big budget film. Color cinematography, by DP Russell Carpenter, is polished and slick. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and close-ups. The best parts of the film are the close-ups of the characters at the blackjack tables. Film editing coincides with plot pacing, and ranges from slow to super fast. Acting is all-around good. Kevin Spacey gives his usual topnotch acting job; Sturgess and Bosworth also give fine performances.It's not a perfect film. Background music was noisy and rather nondescript for my taste. And I could have wished for more card playing, and less time spent on Ben's college buddies in the first Act; the result is that the film gets off to a slow start. Still, the script is credible, and stays close to its book source "Bringing Down The House" by Ben Mezrich.Thematically relevant in today's world of greed and materialism, "21" is a terrific film, one that has greater import than other films, because the events in "21" really happened. And the fine performances and polished visuals enhance the overall look and feel, to create a film that is both engaging and entertaining.

21 is worth seeing on a restless Friday or Saturday night with friends, but it isn't anything more than that. The film features nice performances from actors Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne, as well as nice entries from the lesser known ensemble.However, it doesn't take a film expert to notice some of the more...awful lines. "That's is impressive software."...come on, seriously? Just bad writing.And the flow of the plot is painfully cliché, up until the end where things are admittedly pretty unpredictable. The ending was unexpected, but it worked and made up for earlier plot points that were predictable."21" is entertaining, that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

The true story of six MIT kids who try to fleece Vegas is embellished to say the least in "21." There's lots of added drama, a heap of unintentional campiness, plot twists you can see coming down the Strip, and a love story thrown in for the hell of it. This flick was made for the MTV set...the mechanics of how these kids actually count cards to beat the system is explained quickly but not well. I'm probably an idiot (and I haven't read the book upon which the movie is based) but I still don't get it. This movie makes the "how" not really matter anyway. Why explain boring old math when you can have montages of our ethnically diverse group of spoiled geniuses bar hopping and shopping at Louis Vuitton? If you've seen the trailers than you know 21...there are no surprises here. There is a long running time that makes the last 30 minutes of the film agonizing. There's a few ham-fisted plot twists and double crosses and I kept expecting the movie to end...then WHAM, another scene of our lead character back at the tables in a cheesy disguise and more slow motion shots of the dealer flipping cards.Sturgess is barely passable as Ben...he doesn't quite have the magnetism to pull off the various emotional shadings required of the role. There are parts where he underplays emotion and parts where he overplays them...he never really finds a medium. "21" would have been great ten years ago; give me Giovanni Ribisi in the Ben role and you have something cooking. But Sturgess is pretty blah...so is Kate Bosworth, who looks a lot like Priscilla Presley and nothing like a college student. The only two actors worth a damn here are Spacey, the acerbic ringleader of the young card counters, and the underused Jacob Pitts, who helps recruit Ben into the group.21 does well to show the all-night-long decadence of Vegas, and there are some beautiful shots of the Strip at night. Otherwise the flick is by-the-numbers garbage.

Considering the risky pleasure generally associated with gambling and the seductive thrill of watching a heist or scam unfold, it should come as no surprise that 21, a film which combines the two aforementioned premises should excel at being enjoyable. And while the film may be very familiar ground to anyone with in any experience with Ocean's Eleven style crime capers, and the majority of the film's plot points verge on being almost laughably predictable, it is executed with enough exuberant flair to make it worthwhile in the midst of its formula. A slow start gives the necessary exposition as to how a thoroughly ethical young MIT student (Sturgess)'s desperate need for money to attend Harvard medical school leads him to join a team of mathematical geniuses trained in blackjack card counting who routinely rip off Las Vegas casinos during weekends between class. However, this opening proves overlong, overly predictable, and largely unnecessary, dragging far too much before plunging into the film's real fun as Sturgess and his team are engulfed by the seductive glamour of Vegas and the thrill of the huge monetary takes. Some judicious editing, clearing away such unnecessary subplots (such as a robotics competition with Sturgess' tiresomely stereotypical nerdy friends) could have resulted in a far more streamlined and faster paced film. Some viewers may take offence to the "Hollywoodizing" of the MIT team, with team members of different ethnicity largely shoved to the background in favour of the typically gorgeous Caucasian leads, a disconcertingly common practice in modern day cinema. However, the flashy MTV style cinematography and editing ably capture the engrossing spectacle of Vegas, and once the film gets going, it would be difficult to deny the sheer enjoyment of being swept up in the heady rush of quick wealth and all of its hedonistic trappings.The film's quality cast add credulity to the frequently underwritten characters they portray. Jim Sturgess once again impresses as the ethical math prodigy slowly corrupted by a world of superficial glamour, his endearing charm putting an intriguing enough take on the "troubled but well meaning hero" archetype. As one might expect, Kevin Spacey effortlessly steals the show as the charismatic but ruthless professor managing the MIT card counting team, and Spacey's easygoing yet commanding presence is a profound boost to the film. Kate Bosworth contributes a typically flat performance, but given her token 'inevitable love interest' role, she fails to detract much from the film's overall quality. Lawrence Fishburne adds class, much needed dramatic weight and moments of grim humour to his antagonistic burly head of casino security, gradually catching on to the MIT team's scamming.While the age old adage of 'style over substance' certainly holds true here, 21 may essentially epitomize the modern Hollywood crime caper film, but the formula hasn't quite run dry enough to overly detract from the enjoyment factor. The film's snappy visuals and strong casting are mostly enough to make up for a largely uninspired and frequently weak script. However, fans of similar works will not be disappointed, and for those willing to forgive the film's frequent delving into the wells of convention and accept entertainment over profundity, 21 should prove an ideal watch.-7/10

This film screened at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. It is a reasonable well-made based-on-a-true-story film that tells the story of a group of MIT students who attempt to make a fortune counting cards in Vegas. The screenplay apparently plays pretty fast-and-loose with the version told in the book. Never-the-less, the acting is excellent - especially Jim Sturgess in the role of the lead student. Honestly, his accent was so good that I didn't realize - until he came on stage afterward - that he was British. He does a great job with the mannerisms to give you a real sense of the character's evolution. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are solid - although Fishburne's role is fairly small. The minor characters are not as well-developed as they could have been. The cinematography of both Boston and Las Vegas is quite good, especially on the big screen. It's an interesting story, but they could have edited down a bit to make it move a little quicker. This is a good film, but it probably could have been a lot better.

21 is a movie about game, money and greed and also about how someone can lose his self control when it's all about making "easy money" In the materialistic world we live nowadays money is the center of many things, even those which were supposed to have nothing to do with it, like love or friendship; so making "easy money" is a real temptation even if you have to lie, forget your old friends or to do schemes to achieve it! The main character of this movie can tell it very wellIt's a nice movie about this subject and it shows us the frightening world of Las Vegas casinos'. The plot is quite interesting and appealing and the cast is also good. I score it 7/10.

"21" was the official Opening Night Film of the 2008 SXSW Film Festival. The film is based on the true story of a group of MIT students who use their math skills to "beat the house" at blackjack in the Las Vegas casinos. Robert Luketic ("Legally Blonde") directed the Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb adaptation of Ben Mezrich's bestselling book "Bringing Down the House.""21" is pure Hollywood all the way -- slick and polished, like the wardrobes and personalities inhabited by the kids in their transformation to high rollers. The tight ensemble cast includes Kate Bosworth and Jacob Pitts as team players and Laurence Fishburne as a security chief with a massive dilemma on his hands. But the show belongs to Kevin Spacey as professor Mickey Rosa, mastermind behind the escapade, and Jim Sturgess as Ben Campbell, the reluctant recruit who drives the film as it barrels headlong to a breathless climax.The script is clever, funny, and worthy of math geeks everywhere, and the widescreen action is as nonstop as that on the casino floor. Spacey is Spacey at his best -- just the Kevin we know, nothing more, nothing less -- and that's good enough. Sturgess, a Brit playing an American here (quite well, by the way), proves that he is destined for stardom in the States.In the intro to the screening, Luketic explained how Spacey had bought the rights to Mezrich's book, leading to his having to fight to win the actor over and let him direct the film. Memo to Kevin: thank you. And, whatever you do, wait for the end credits. The stunning remix of the Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want" is almost worth the price of admission.

I enjoyed the movie because it was entertaining all the way. It was slick and had interesting characters. The only problem was the last half of it where credibility when flying out the window. The movie is all about supposedly very intelligent people, led by the smartest of the all the group, the only veteran in this college age-dominated cast: "Professor Mickey Rosa," played by Kevin Spacey. Well, Rosa would not do what he did here, for starters, meaning trusting an untrustworthy and revenge-seeking kid. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. The others in the group wouldn't go along with the renegade - "Ben Campbell" (Jim Sturgess) - either. There is no way this kid is going to totally outsmart the professor, but it makes for good Hollywood dramatics.There are a bunch of other holes, too, such as wanting to be anonymous but going back to the same place; a ridiculous chase scene through the casino gambling area and kitchen; hand signals that a junior detective could see (and are never changed!) and - maybe the worst - winning tons of money in sessions. Nobody with half a brain would win much at any session, because it draws attention. You win a little here, a little there and go from place-to-place and remain anonymous. This movie is based on a true story, and I can guarantee you that's what the MIT students did in real life - not what you see here.Still, facts aside, it's still a fun movie to watch and since entertainment is the name of the game with films, it succeeds and I still give it an "8" star rating for that. At no time was I bored and overly insulted at the dumbness that I would have stopped playing the DVD. It will hold your interest and you'll be thoroughly entertained, especially if you don't know a lot about blackjack and how casinos operate.Oh, as a postscript: they don't beat up "card counters" in back rooms of casinos. If they think you are counting cards, which I don't believe is illegal, they still have the right to kick you out of their establishment.....but they ask you nicely and you are removed from the floor with no big scene or violence. They have your picture, there are security people everywhere, and you aren't allowed back.So, enjoy the film but don't believe the screenplay.

I suppose the first time I saw a preview for 21 was probably close to 7 months ago, so I did know there was a film coming out and it looked fairly interesting. Since I am getting around the age of being able to gamble and go to vegas, it was nice being able to see the scene of vegas in an up-to-date movie! I love the characters, and im sorry the Asian kid.. haha all I could think of was disturbia ringtone.. HAHA!I loved the way Kevin Spacey played the whole good guy, bad guy role.. It was nice seeing him in a role like this, simply because I relate him back to Pay it Forward, and I believe that this is a great role for his personality. The main character does a great job really showing the struggles that college students do face everyday. Though most of us cannot say that we have a 4.0 at MIT and are awaiting money to attend Harvard, I can personally relate to the financial struggle college does bring to myself personally. Maybe I should go card count!??Once you started to pay attention I really began figuring out the true meaning behind card counting and it really is very simple, with the word connection to the card value. As for the gestures, they were a big out there, and I really think that Vegas PD would catch on to the whole arm behind the back thing 10 times quicker, simply because it is such a drastic move. The movie is great, and I personally loved it because it played out the roles of each of the characters and came to a conclusion with all of them. Sorry, but it was nice seeing what happened to Spacey at the end. :]7 out of 10! Go see this film!

After Reading Ben Mezrich's "Bringing Down the House", upon which this movie is based, I was excited to the movie. I am usually let down by movies that are based on books, but that was not the case this time.Although there were a handful of cliché parts of the movie, all in all it was excellently done. The visual effects were well done, and the acting on the part of Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, and Kate Bosworth, was exemplary. Some people may criticize Spacey for his 'gusto', but I believe his portrayal of Mickey was stellar.The movie had suspense, a solid plot line, scattered funny scenes, and a good ending. The people I went with, none of whom had read the book, found it an even better movie than I did. If you like the movie enough, I recommend reading the book for a more complete story.

The movie was good but awfully familiar....In fact, living in Canada, there was a film called "The Last Casino" starting Charles Martin Smith as a University Professor who assembled a team of his brighter students and taught them how to count cards playing Black Jack. While certainly there were differences between the two films, I couldn't help but get the feeling I'd seen it all before. I did enjoy the acting of Jim Sturgess as the main character, and Kevin Spacey was chillingly evil. Kate Bosworth was good, but mostly eye candy. Laurence Fishburne had a good role as a Security consultant at the casino. I have to admit, the scenes where Jim Sturgess was showing his mind worked while counting the cards was ingenious. It gave the feeling that everything was slowed down and he could interpret the cards in a leisurely fashion, while in fact it was probably happening at break neck speed. The ending was satisfying.

This movie was based on a true story, and if the makers had stuck closer to the true story it could have been a much better movie. But no, they had to Hollywoodize it and dumb it down so that anyone with the least knowledge of the game of blackjack and how casinos operate will be saying "No way" to themselves all through the movie. It actually ends up with a chase scene and characters running through the kitchen, for God's sake.In real life the team's success was 90% in being careful to not attract the attention of the casinos detectors and only 10% in their scheme, which was based on the well-known technique of card-counting to get an edge. In the movie, the team's actions were childishly crude even to the point of continually returning to the same casino...so the movie makers could develop the characters of the casino bad guys. In real life the team was careful to not win much at any one table or at any one casino, not more than $1,000 a session, which would be well within the amount any lucky player might win without counting. In the movie they hit the same table for tens of thousands of dollars, which would have set off alarms all over Nevada. Even the hand signals the team used in the movie were childishly obvious. All this by the supposedly brilliant MIT students and professor. No way.The movie actually had the bad casino guys torturing card counters when they caught them. No way. In real life a casino has the right, tested in court, to kick anyone out and ban them from ever playing again...they do not have to prove cheating or card-counting, they do it under the laws of trespassing on their private property and this is what they do. Remember, card-counters are only making what amounts to an hourly wage, so they are not a serious threat to a casino.Another example of the Hollywood treatment was that after showing how brilliant Ben was at counting cards when they were recruiting him, he was not used as the card counter, he was used as the big bettor and one of the female team members did the counting.an entertaining movie for someone not knowledgeable or much interested in real life casino gambling, but dumb and dumber for those who are.

Warning - may contain spoilers.I will make this very brief.Kevin Spacey... shame on you for accepting such a role.The movie was below the passing line and I would not watch it again on my deathbed if it meant it would keep me alive.What the screenwriters may have not kept in mind is that many of the viewers, those who would actually go and see the movie, may not have read the book or know of all the juicy details that have been left out of the movie. I had to figure out what the count of cards was on my own. It felt nice to have to use your brain a little to figure something out, but as I was reading other posts (comments) I learned that what I had figured out on my own was very primitive and much more elaboration would have made things clearer and given the movie a little more edge - although its pretty round edged to me.Why would the MIT professor be so cruel and mean and cold, to the point that he had to call the casino security which results in the beating of one of his "brilliant" students who had made him tons of money.How could that same professor so quickly be convinced in a scene of about 1 min and 45 seconds to go back to the table and play a "last round" with the same student he had screwed over and so openly called as a cunning genius... Did this professor lack intellect? This made no sense what so ever and was very unbelievable as something that a rational person would do.One thing to admit, the final twists were unpredictable.. but by that point I had already developed my own mind about the movie... Big fat failure. I'm ashamed I wasted my time watching it. I thought it would be good... I guess the next time I see spacey in a movie, I wont be able to take the movie off the shelf without questions asked as I once did...

A great young cast tell a whirlwind story that zips in places, but drags slightly in others. Kevin Spacey steals the show as the mastermind behind the MIT card-counting team (who are all remarkably glamorous - wonder if they were in real life?) The cinematography captured the bright lights of Vegas particularly well and the sheer fun and excitement of what they were doing was well communicated to the audience. It plays the twists and turns in a similar way to the Ocean's series and there was a flavour of those here. My 12 year-old son thought it was great and although there were some adult themes it was played in an easy-going harmless style.

"21" follows the rise (and ultimate fall, and what happens afterward) of a college math wiz recruited by his professor to outwit the blackjack tables at Las Vegas and make a ton of money. It's a well made movie with lots of class and style, and if you aren't turned off by the notion of filthy lucre, then you are bound to enjoy this.The movie works well because of its cast. Jim Sturgess, the young male lead, is outstanding. He does a great job of transitioning from initial uncertainty to eventual acceptance and ultimately relishing his new "career." He's eminently likable and you can't help pulling for him all the way.Kate Bosworth is lovely as his love interest, always impeccably polished. She looks a bit old for the part of a college student, and especially her style of clothing in the casinos (while ravishing) is not quite right for a 21-year old. I wish more buildup had been devoted to her relationship with Sturgess, but the movie is all told from his angle. Best of all, Kevin Spacey is dead-on as the ringleader. He is cool, efficient, very sharp with every line. As always, he always manages to steal every scene he is in.There is also a nice subplot about these aging casino security agents, who are being phased out in favor of software recognition systems. It gives the movie more depth and interest, and ultimately you can't help realizing that these guys, while "villains" in one sense, are also "heroes" in another.The look of the film is fabulous, well worth consideration for art direction. It's all about Vegas, but not over the top, somehow. You never blame the character for falling into the trap, because it is all so addictive: the cash, the clothes, the fabulous rooms (it's almost worth seeing the movie just to see those penthouse suites!). The editing and camera work are awesome. They did an especially good job zooming way in on the cards, to where they almost become characters in the story. But it never gets technical, it never dwells on splitting 8's or hitting a soft 17 or anything like that. Even if you know nothing about the game (and I know very little), it won't impair your enjoyment of the movie.It's not a very deep movie, but it does have insight into human character and motivation. It's mainly just a lot of fun to watch. I give it a solid 8 (maybe shading towards 8-1/2).

21 had huge plot holes, (why did Cole, the casino man, send his henchmen after Ben if they were actually working together all along?) it had terrible morals, (at the end it turns out that the whole gang will keep cheating anyway), the acting was choppy, and it glamorized Vegas, casinos and strip clubs like they're the best things in the world. Please don't see this movie, because if its successful, they'll make a sequel or a remake or something, and the movie fans of the world deserve better than this rubbish. And in case I wasn't clear, it isn't terrible as a film but it had evil morals. Don't don't don't don't don't see it, I made the mistake of going, don't make that mistake.

In this exuberant, smart and fast-paced drama/comedy, there is no denying that you can't have fun watching a hard working, but financially struggling kid, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) become seduced by the wily king of card-counting Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey). It is good to have thrown in such a veteran actor like Spacey into a mix of new comers like Campbell, Kate Bosworth or Aaron Yoo. Also Spacy produced the film, based on Ben Mezrich's autobiographical novel "Bringing Down The House" which chronicles the uprising and downfall of the group of card-counters. Campbell is a hard-working kid that uses his intellect to arouse the attention of his mathematics teacher, who just happens to be the leader of a group of intelligent cheaters who go to Las Vegas every weekend to, well, count-cards. At first Campbell is skeptical in taking part in such an activity, with a history as unnerving as it is, but being informed that there is no danger and it is not at all illegal, he rethinks, because in order to get into Harvard Med, he needs 300,000$. Mickey informs him that within a month of joining them on their escapades, he will have the money easily. The humor is spread through the film, the dramatic elements are the dangers that the weary kid faces, being Casinoss what they are with security, and the serious points about what greed and desire do to you. Campbell said he was only in for the money he needed to get into Harvard, but it is harder to stop then he thinks. That is why Spacey's role as Mickey is so important, the mentor is both guiding them on the table, and off the table. He was more right about Vegas then anyone. Director Robert Luketic's trip from chick flicks like "Legally Blonde" and "Monster-In-Law" to this was quite a voyage, but there is a sub-text that remains true to his conception that 'the law is the law, and heck if were gonna break it...'. And the lead protagonist in this film really developed from the quiet, geeky kid to the partying and greedy monster that Vegas spawned was a very down-hill, bumpy trip that would land him right back to the drawing board, but the end is one that came to no surprise, but to my regret, I can't tell you just yet. See it yourself, it was a fun trip. Funny.

This film has a youthful enthusiasm which is infectious and a young cast that pulls off the infection. It is done Hollywood Flashback style in that it starts after everything happens, goes to back to how it happens and then ends by going back to the beginning.Overall, sadly, it obviously spent a lot of money in production but tries to simplify things a bit too much. While it is entertaining, it is much too simplified to interest the serious gambler. The appeal here is in telling the story in a light mood, interesting a young audience, and entertaining it. In that sense it succeeds though not on quite the stylish ease that a movie like "The Sting" did. Of course that one was a best picture. This one is not.AS I have not read the novel, I am not sure what liberties were taken from the true story but my feeling is that the true story here is a better tale than the movie one. That being said, as I put my brain away & look for light fare, this one fills the bill quite nicely. Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, and the rest of the cast do quite fine in going through a not too serious treatment.I have seen worse, & better films than this one.

I was lucky enough to see this film for free at a special screening in greater London as part of a market research by the film industry. even though it was free i would have paid good money to see that film. but I was presently surprised about how good the film was and everyone seemed to agree that the film was really good. I thought it made the card playing parts actually riveting even though i am not a card player myself. i thought the acting performances were all good especially that of Kevin Spacey's. In terms of the story. In many ways it reminded me of all the good things that was in the BBC TV show hustle. But in a much more real way. On the down side, you may see the ending coming and there is a romance part of the film that feels unnecessary. However it is a very slick film that gets away with it. I would say that it clearly the best film in this genre of film. I enjoyed it more than films such as Confidence and the Oceans 11 type films. I would highly recommend it to anybody when it eventually comes out in April!! I would have thought that they would cut down and re-edit it a bit on the basis that it was quite long. however it kept my attention for the whole film and that is not something that is also done during these sorts of films

21 certainly won't go into my books as the most intelligent or deep movie I've ever seen, in fact as far as Hollywood films go 21 is about as shallow as they come. They stack the cast with some big names, flashy romance, the latest fad...in this case cards...Blackjack to be exact, and people will come out in droves to see it. Now there was a Canadian made film about this same story entitled "The Last Casino" (see my review) and if you ever get a chance to see it definitely check it out because it's one of the better Canadian movies I've seen and it also actually is much smarter and more artistic than 21 but tells the nearly identical story. Still 21 has some key elements going for it including a new hot lead actor that is very talented, a big budget, fun with cards, a half decent story and a little romance thrown in to boot. It just won't have you walking away feeling any smarter or better about life and that's okay as long as it entertains.Latest It Boy Jim Sturgess following his success in Across The Universe plays math genius Ben Campbell. Sturgess has this definite quality about him that I predict will make him an absolute star and big movies like this definitely help and he already has a recognizable face. He is very energetic and really shines on screen and he is just someone you relate to and can watch him in this adventure plus he gets to show some emotion and probably the only character with depth in the film. Kevin Spacey is the powerhouse of the film or at least he's supposed to be. I mean in all fairness he does well as the leader of their gambling group and a University professor but he doesn't do as much with the part as I would have thought. He doesn't really grip you as much as he could have considering the man can act and is a legend in his own right. Kate Bosworth is lovely but in all honestly I found her downright boring in this film. She does little to nothing other than look cute and be a romantic interest for Sturgess' character which I thought the entire romance felt forced anyways although they had decent chemistry. Fellow team members Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira are practically non existent as the entire film focuses almost entirely on the three of the main big actors which is unfortunate for them. Someone who does stand out from the rest though is larger than life Laurence Fishburne as an aging security agent for Casinos. He is really great in the role and makes an awesome anti-hero to the story.The cast is decent although no one really is mind blowing but that could be because of the rather lack luster script. You know a twist is coming and you're trying to figure it out as you go but even if you don't figure it out the twist doesn't really shock you or anything. Basically what I am saying is that millions will see 21 and probably enjoy it and I don't disagree with them. The film is fun but it's just not something that will stick with you for very long. It's Hollywood fodder made to make money and it will likely do that but don't expect it to be a time lasting classic or anything. But check it out and see for yourself. 7/10

I had the really cool opportunity to see an advance screening of "21" tonight. Having read the book when it first came out, I was a bit skeptical about whether it would translate well. I couldn't have been more pleased. Was it the same as the book? Of course not (except for The Green Mile, what was?) But it was action-packed, smart, fun, well-acted, well-directed, and just plain enjoyable. Spacey, Fishburne, and Bosworth are at the top of their games and Jim Sturgess is going to be a star. The visuals were great, the editing sharp, and the score right on point. I don't know whether to stay up all night re-reading the book or hop on a plane for Las Vegas to try to win while I still halfway remember the counting system. I enjoyed this as much as any light fare I have seen in a long time. I love George Clooney, but "21" is an order of magnitude better than any of the "Oceans" movies.

Greetings again from the darkness. Fascinating real life story based on the book by Ben Mezrich gets slick, polished Hollywood treatment from well known fluff director Robert Luketic ("Legally Blonde", "Mother-In-Law").For some reason the MIT students racial mix is much different than the real life stuff. Wait, I believe that reason would be Box Office appeal/money!! Kevin Spacey is a fine choice for the ego-maniacal professor who is the brains behind the brainy operation that takes Vegas for a ride. Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth are the eye candy inserted to make this tolerable for a wider audience.The actual guy whose Sturgess' character is based on, Jeffrey Ma, has a quick role as a Planet Hollywood dealer. Throw in Laurence Fishbourne as an old school security muscle man, mix it with some slow-mo and fast edits and loud music and you have Hollywood's idea of high-tech Gen Y thriller. My advice ... read the book.

I was intrigued by the preview of 21 because I'm a sucker for films about gambling, and this is a film about gambling ~ it's the director/writers gambling with our intelligence, hoping we're completely devoid of brainpower, which would make us stupid enough to buy any of the claptrap we see on screen in this bonafide turkey.The beginning is good, it's only when the true fun should be starting - when Ben starts going to Vegas as part of the blackjack team headed by Micky (Kevin Spacey) - that the movie begins to seriously fall apart.Vegas is a huge town, with literally hundreds of casinos, but these clowns wind up going back to the SAME casino, over and over, using the SAME signals to one another (their ridiculous signal to indicate a hot table, for instance), until it's more than blatantly obvious to the security overseer, Laurence Fishburne, that these stooges are playing a very dangerous - and stupid - game.The story then continues on its deathtrail of stupidity, with the storyline and the characters' behavior becoming more and more ridiculous until Ben - duhhhh - loses Everything and has to - double duhhhh - find a way to outsmart Micky (a 2-year-old could outsmart this guy) and get his life back together. The way it's done is even stupider than what proceeds it, what with Ben luring Micky back to the SAME casino for one last shot at the Big Money. "They'll know us there," Micky says, "So we'll have to wear disguises." Oh yeah, genius - a cowboy hat and fake mustache really make Spacey look like a totally different person (not), and even stupider --- they show up using the SAME signals that they've used all along; yes, these giboneys are that dumb.Then, to insult the audience even further, the writers tack on what they believe, in their deluded states, to be a double surprise ending. By this time, the only surprise is that anyone is still left in the movie theatre.
