Beverly Hills Cop is most definitely a classic, and I must say Beverly Hills Cop II lives up to the first one reasonably well. Everything that I enjoyed from the first one was carried on in this one, which is simultaneously a perk and a flaw. A perk because the style of the first was great, but a flaw because it did feel familiar in many respects. There is a little bit of a sense that if you've seen the first one, you've seen the second one. That being said this film is a hoot, and I can't wait to watch the third instalment.The plot is all a bit ludicrous and didn't entirely make sense (to me at any rate). There was nothing too original about the core concept, feeling a bit James Bondy in a way. It wasn't bad at all, and ticked along at a zippy pace, with a good variety of action sequences, comedic moments and sharply scripted scenes. The Beverly Hills Cop films aren't really about the plot though, its all about Eddie Murphy.He is just so god damn funny, and possibly at his comedic acting peak in the 80s. His comedic timing, body language, facial expressions are second to none, making Beverly Hills Cop II hilarious. I actually think the humour was as decent as the first film, its just the plot which doesn't match up in quality. There are several cast members returning from the first instalment, all of whom put in solid performances, but as mentioned its 100% Murphy's film.I also just love the style of 80s films, and Beverly Hills Cop II has so many 80s trademarks. From the soundtrack to the direction to the script. Its just a blast.Any fans of the Beverly Hills Cop franchise or Eddie Murphy in general will for sure love this film. It a bit messy in places but that never detracts from it's numerous triumphs.

The original Beverley Hills Cop is one of those films that remains a cult classic because of the fact that it's such a product of the time it was made. This quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel, made three years later, and although part two; like many sequels, never quite manages that same verve as the original film - it still offers a good time, and anyone that enjoyed the first instalment (and who didn't?) will probably have a good time with this sequel too. All the main players from the original film have been rounded up once again, with Eddie Murphy heading a capable ensemble cast, lots of wisecracks and some gratuitously over the top action sequences. The plot is, as you would expect, superfluous to the style of the film; and much of the movie is simply tailored around it; but anyway, it follows maverick copper Axel Foley and his two California police cronies as they are pulled into a case known as the 'alphabet murders', which involves a robbery, a tall blonde woman and a gun shop owner.I've got to say that Eddie Murphy's wisecracks were a lot funnier in the first film. While they were still over the top, they were at least sort of believable. Here, however, Murphy goes massively over the top, and it's hard to imagine how anyone that obnoxious doesn't end up with a cracked jaw. Anyway, Murphy obviously enjoys himself; and if you can get by the complete lack of logic, you probably will too. True to style, the action is completely over the top too; with several ridiculous sequences combining to make the movie the entertaining blockbuster that it is. The film lacks any kind of themes or substance, meaning that it will both not please serious film fans, and that this reviewer is running out of steam; but I will say that this movie does have a point to make, and that is simply entertaining it's audience. It may be completely silly, illogical fun; but some movies need to be there just to entertain, and this is one of those. I wouldn't recommend sticking this movie at the top of any must see lists, or going into with huge expectations; but it's a good time, that's for sure.

I know this goes against the grain, but I did enjoy this sequel to Beverly Hills Cop more than the original. I was not the biggest fan of the first film, it had its moments, but I did really enjoy this one. This one has Foley returning to Beverly Hills to help the friends he made from the first film solve a set of robberies and a cop getting shot. I do not know, but I enjoyed the story more and I also enjoyed the inclusion of Brigitte Nielsen as the bad guy for the piece. She was rather good for a short stretch, but faded quite fast like a lot of actresses. I enjoyed the chemistry between Murphy, Reinhold and Ashton my favorite scene where Axel (Murphy) and Taggart (Ashton) were discussing Billy (Reinhold) possibly having a problem as he had quite an assortment of weapons and gun paraphernalia. The action in this one is really good too and I like the humor a bit more here too. To me it is a better film, but that is me. Most people like the first one better I imagine, I just thought this one had a bit more substance to it than the first film. I think this one is a wild ride and the cast is comfortable with their roles. I am sure we can all agree that it is a better sequel than the third movie.

I finally saw this sequel and it was better than what many people say. Murphy has some very hilarious moments and Reinhold and Ashton were just as good.  Also, the action scene's were decent too, though the chase with the cement truck was'nt as good as the chase in the first with the transport truck.  I did notice that the film lacked the freshness of the first one but still it was fun to watch.

Sequel to the hugely successful 1984 movies, this film was most unfairly slated by critics. I believe in some ways it is better than the original and certainly far, far better than the third installment. The story is, despite what everyone says, very engaging and keeps you watching the whole time. Eddie Murphy starred in Coming to America shortly after this, and then his career took a nosedive, although he seems to be making a comeback. If he is given more roles like this, he'll do better.

Beverly Hills Cop 2 is pretty much just the same as the original Beverly Hills Cop but without the freshness and originality of the 1st. Murphy is still a perfect Axel Foley and with some good supporting characters such as his foul mouthed chief of police and Detectives Rosewood and Taggart the movie does have it's moments but the rules of diminishing returns still apply.With a bit more originality in the script and a bit more daring this really could have been great. But for a sequel this isn't to bad just more of the same but not quite as good.6/10 - Not as good as the original but far superior to the tepid third instalment.

Long ago, when Eddie Murphy was the biggest star in Hollywood, Beverly Hills Cop 2 was the most anticipated film of 1987. Movies like Trading Places and 48 Hours made Murphy famous. But Axel Foley made him a superstar. Impressed by Top Gun (even though it's a truly awful film), Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer brought Tony Scott on board to direct. What they forgot to do was polish the script.Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help solve 'The Alphabet Crimes' after his old pal Lt. Bogomil is gunned down in the street. With Taggart and Rosewood in tow (now actually doing police work instead of standing by) Axel uncovers a seriously convoluted conspiracy.The story should have taken a back seat to allow Murphy to work over the massive holes in the plot with his distracting wisecracks. I won't lie to you, there are some utterly horrible contrivances in BHC2 (Bogomil's daughter digging up dirt at the insurance company she just happens to work at is honestly the most obnoxious movie coincidence of all time), but you'll just have to suffer them.This might have been easy to overlook, but Tony Scott, still finding his feet as a director, and his editors turn a great deal of the film into an incomprehensible mess. Some of the continuity errors are just baffling (where did Rosewood get the coffee cup from at the night club crash scene?) and it makes the action quite hard to follow.However, Tony Scott's highly visual style of filmmaking is far more suiting to this kind of environment. The wealth and decadence of late 80s California is all over this movie, and it's the only aspect where it improves on the original. I doubt the latter day Scott would make the movie this way, but it's definitely the best looking of the trilogy. It's also the only one to be shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio (however it's Super35 instead of the superior anamorphic Panavision format).

Yes, I know that sounds a bit hyperbole, but the opening jewel robbery, seguing directly into Eddie Murphy dressing for work with Bob Seger's "Shakedown" in the background is one of the best film openings I have ever seen.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just average, and is nowhere near as good as the original. If you don't want to sit though the whole movie, at least try to catch the opening few minutes on YouTube, if you can.

Beverly Hills Cop II is definitely my all time favorite Action comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop (1984) will always be the best and my all time favorite film that I love to death. That is why I just love the sequel much more and I have always enjoyed this film much better than the original film I did. Here Axel Foley,Billy Rosewood and John Taggart works as a team than they did in the first film. This time Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help Taggart and Rosewood investigate Chief Bogomil's near-fatal shooting and the series of strange robberies "alphabet crimes" associated with it. Axel Foley comes back which he reunites with Detective Billy Rosewood and Detective Sergeant John Taggart.I love the Action sequences they are all great , humor , suspense , tongue in cheek, shoot'em up and is developed in agility and movement and for that reason is amusing. They are all great, there isn't any cgi in it. Whole cast did a great job. It is my all time favorite sequel to the first film. I seriously I love this film to death and I always have enjoyed so much. I still don't get it why all the hate for this film? The third film was really the worst in the series but I still like it and I will still watch it. Eddie Murphy did a great job as a Detroit detective Axel Foley, he did acted very well. Yes he was shouting one everyone I saw that, but there are things in the film that people didn't noticed. After his friend Captain Andrew Bogomil was shot he didn't hesitate to come to Beverly Hills and helping him out. He cared more about his friend than anyone else did. He hustle Maxwell Dent accountant Sidney Bernstein for $200 but, he later donated the money for Beverly Hills homeless people. He could spend the money but he donated. After he took Billy's vitamins and he bluff out the secretary in Beverly Hills Gun Club for money and he throw the vitamins away. he gave the money back to Billy for the vitamins he throw away! I thought that was very nice. Judge Reinhold as Detective Billy Rosewood did a wonderful job and a support in the main cast along side Axel Foley. He was crazy with guns which I love it. We see poster from Stallone's Cobra and Rambo: First Blood Part II in Billy's apartment. I love how he was driving the car and caring so much guns with him. He had a turtle in his apartment awesome. John Ashton as Detective Sergeant John Taggart did a pretty good job as detective helping and solving a Alphabet crime he was awesome. Brigitte Nielsen as Karla Fry did a wonderful job as villainies and it was one of her best roles I have ever seen. Jürgen Prochnow as Maxwell Dent was fantastic villain much better than Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks in the first movie did. Dean Stockwell as Charles "Chip" Cain did a fantastic job as Dent henchman. Allen Garfield as Chief Harold Lutz was fantastic he was so load and funny I was keep laughing at his performance. The Last and at least the best small role that had was Ronny Cox I seriously I love him in this film. He doesn't do much but his still a good as Andrew Bogomil we finally found out that he has a daughter Jan and she is very beautiful. There are other faces in this film like are Hugh Hefner who plays himself, Chris Rock has a small cameo in it.Gilbert Hill as Inspector G. Douglas Todd and Paul Reiser as Detective Jeffrey Friedman also return from the first film and they also do have a few scenes in the film.In the original movie they were only in the beginning of the film than they were cut off from the rest of the film. I seriously think Tony Scott did a wonderful job filming this decent awesome Action Comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop II is a 1987 action comedy film starring Eddie Murphy and directed by Tony Scott. It is the sequel to the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop and the second installment in the Beverly Hills Cop series.Although it made less money than the original Beverly Hills Cop and received mixed reviews from critics, the film was still a box office success, making $153,665,036 domestically.I love this film to death!!! I love this film to death! it will always stay in my heart! I love the shooting, action, car chases, playboy girls everything in this film. I love Eddie Murphy! I also love the main theme for Axel Foley from Harold Faltermeyer and songs a Better Way" - James Ingram,Shakedown" - Bob Seger and Hold On" by Corey Hart.

After the original hit so big in 84 it was inevitable (and to a 14 year old like me) quite welcome that a sequel would be cobbled together. The surprising part of it all is that this film is almost as good as the first, and despite being panned mercilessly by many it remains one of my favourite guilty pleasures from the 80s. In fact I probably know this film better than the original.Axel Foley is once again drawn back to Beverly Hills from his cosy, dangerous rut in Detroit – much to his superior Detective Todd's chagrin. This time he is there to uncover just who is responsible for Lt Bogomil being gunned down there. (One photo of a fishing trip is enough to inform us that between the first and second film the Beverly Hills Police crew and Axel have become fast friends.) The mechanics of the sequel demand that it be more elaborate, so this time Axel, Taggert and Rosewood find themselves on the trail of the Alphabet criminals, so called for leaving clues in the form of letters and performing their crimes alphabetically – wonder how they would have gone if they made it to 'Q'? With the characters already introduced and by this stage well-defined, all that is left is to get into it. The sequel has a soundtrack that is almost as good as the original, action sequences that hurtle along almost as well, and better criminal big wigs in the form of Jurgen Prochnow and unfathomably tall and blond Bridget Neilson.It seems to me that the first two Beverly Hills Cop films were taken very seriously by the filmmakers, with no Martin Brest at the helm a savvy move was made to put Tony Scott behind the wheel, a man that can make reading the phone book more adrenalising and somehow exciting.The last 45 minutes of BHC2 is in fact almost one long unbroken action sequence, with chase scene after chase scene, most only broken up to pause while Axel breaks out another character voice to bluff his way into or out of trouble.The pacing of the sequel is probably better than the original, thanks again to the fact that Scott didn't need to bother us with character development, and the series of coincidences and fluke meetings that hold the plot together are forgivable given just how entertaining the rest of the film is.Final Rating – 8 / 10. OK it isn't all-time great and it relies on Murphy's charm to smooth over some dull spots, but this remains undeniably rewatchable and continues to amuse.

I love Eddie Murphy, but this is a very weak vehicle for his talents. Sure, he's got some good scenes and some good lines, the eighties vibes is a blast, the music was very good, and we see cameos from lots of Murphy's comedian friends, including a very young Chris Rock; but the sum total is very modest. The movie is one Hollywood cliché after another, with endless dumb chase scenes, a police commissioner who says the same things in every scene, and a lame plot. His two buddies are predictable. Eddie Murphy was fresh and gritty and unpredictable in Beverly Hills Cop and 48 Hours, Trading Places, Coming to America, Bowfinger and other films. But on this one they went for a formula, and it falls flat.

"Beverly Hills Cop II" is the entertaining sequel to the 1984 smash hit. Of course, this sequel can't top the original, but it's still pretty good. Eddie Murphy returns as Axel Foley and returns to Beverly Hills to help avenge the attack of a friend. This movie isn't as fresh as the original movie, but I found myself laughing alot throughout. Plus, the action scenes are well done. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, and Paul Reiser all reprise their roles from the first film along with Murphy. "Beverly Hills Cop II" is a movie that's loud and noisy at times, but it's funny and entertaining. And it's much better than the disappointing third movie in the series, "Beverly Hills Cop III".*** (out of four)

Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) returns to Beverly Hills to help Taggart (John Ashton) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) investigate Chief Bogamil's near-fatal shooting and the series of "alphabet crimes" associated with it.So, how do you top the greatest action comedy of all time? You bring in director Tony Scott ("Top Gun") to spruce up the action, car chases and explosions. You also improve Judge Reinhold's character. In the first film, he was more or less just background. Here, he has a personality and is even more eccentric than Foley himself! I did like the nods to Sylvester Stallone. Casting his wife, putting his posters up all over... it was like a consolation prize for backing out of the first film.

Beverly Hills Cop is a classic, but this one while not awful was a disappointment in comparison. The set pieces are spectacular, Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold are good together and individually, Jurgen Prochnov and Brigitte Nielson suitably ham it up, the film is assuredly directed and it moves briskly. However, what is missing is a good enough story and a decent script. The story is sadly quite predictable, and the script is also unfunny and lacking sorely in wit. The soundtrack isn't as memorable either and while flashy some of the production values make little impact. Overall, it is okay but in comparison to the wonderful original it is lacking. 5/10 Bethany Cox

Beverly Hills Cop is my favorite comedy of all time, and its reputation as a classic of 1980s cinema is well earned. Its two sequels, however, are not held in as in high regard. The two follow-ups are often lumped together as lackluster efforts, which isn't fair since while Beverly Hills Cop II isn't a comedic masterpiece like the first one, it's the definitely the much stronger sequel. Having just watched the film for the first time in years, I found it to be a whole lot better than I remember. In fact, I'd say it's a quite an underrated sequel.The best decision made by director Tony Scott and the creative team behind Beverly Hills Cop II was to bring back almost all the actors from the first movie. Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, Gilbert Hill, and Paul Reiser are just as great here as they were in the original. Unlike with most sequels, nobody on screen appears to be phoning in a performance for a paycheck. The main trio of Murphy, Reinhold, and Ashton are together for a good 80% of the film, and are absolutely perfect together. The three actors share amazing chemistry as a group, making every scene with them a blast to watch. The fact that their friendship feels real is what elevates Beverly Hills Cop II from ever feeling like just an unnecessary sequel. Beverly Hills Cop II has some of the same story beats as Beverly Hills Cop, but it never comes across as a lazy retread. The best parts of Beverly Hills Cop II are the noticeable differences from the first film. Rather than having to solve the murder of a friend, Axel must discover who shot Bogomil (Cox). Tony Scott gets a bit of suspense out of whether Bogomil will live or die, and there's a few surprisingly touching scenes between Axel and Bogomil's daughter. These scenes could have felt out of place in what is mostly a comedy, but they work quite well. What really separates Beverly Hills Cop II from the first one, as well as from most action movies in general, is that the main villain is a very intimidating woman, Karla Fry (Bridgitte Nielsen). There has been some criticism that the treatment of her character is misogynistic, though I've never seen much to support that argument. She may not be the most three-dimensional character every written, but the fact that we don't learn all that much about her makes her even more menacing. One of the best aspects to the story is that there is a hierarchy of villains. In addition to Karla, there's also the memorable Maxwell Dent (Jurgen Prochnow). The scene where Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart track down Max at the Playboy Mansion is the film's highlight, and one of the funniest scenes in any movie ever. Almost every single line in the scene is hilarious, Chris Rock gets a cool little cameo, and the scene somehow manages to be feel completely relevant to the plot. However, the Playboy Mansion scene also draws attention to the one major flaw of Beverly Hills Cop II that keeps it from being a truly great movie: the noticeably rough editing. Martin Brest has been quoted as saying that Beverly Hills Cop was saved in the editing room, and that he was amazed at how well everything cut together. Beverly Hills Cop II should have been looked at more closely in the editing room, because it is far from seamless. Several scenes seem to end randomly without any much sense of transition or rhythm. In some instances, the editing is just downright awkward. The best example of this is in the Playboy Mansion scene. Once Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart have left the mansion and the narrative of the scene is effectively over, the camera lingers on a random party-goer dancing enthusiastically to some music. The guy's dance moves are mildly amusing, but there is no real reason for the shot to be in the movie, and it feels extremely disconnected from the rest of the scene. Beverly Hills Cop II is filled with moments in which scenes don't cut at a logical endpoint. There are three credited editors, no doubt the result of a rushed post-production schedule to get the movie out by a certain release date. None of the bad editing kills my overall enjoyment of the film, though it's impossible not to be distracted by its shoddiness at times.With the exception of the poor editing, it's clear there was actually effort and care put into Beverly Hills Cop II, something that can't be said for sequels made in today's era. Just like with the original Beverly Hills Cop, this sequel has tremendous replay value. Though it might not be as well put together as its predecessor, Beverly Hills Cop II still works way, way better than 95% of sequels to classic comedies. 8/10

In this second film about notorious Detroit detective , the foul-mouth and tough Axel Foley (Edddie Murphy) again returns at Beverly Hills to resolve the responsible for the murder of his chief (Ronny Cox) who has been gunned down by a tall woman (Brigitte Nielsen). He decides to track down and clues lead to alphabet robberies that are masterminded by a weapons kingpin . As always , he's helped by a pair of sympathetics mates (Judge Reinhold and John Ashton) . They'll have to confront evil nasties (Jurgen Prochnow and Dean Stockwell) and hold numerous risks , odds and dangers . The picture is plenty of action , humor , suspense , tongue in cheek, shoot'em up and is developed in agility and movement and for that reason is amusing . The picture provides fast and furious amusement with spectacular scenes and unstopped-action. Relief comic is in charge of Eddie Murphy as his foul and fast-talking creates most big smiles and causing wreak havoc on the way . Besides his various jokes with the sidekicks steal enormous laughs . For that the picture is a ¨Buddy movie¨ though there's a trio protagonist . Eddie Murphy as streetsmart detective is top-notch, as Axel Foley is his greatest smash-hit and converted him in a top-international-star confirming his position with continued successes in the box office . Fish out water formula used in several films is well narrated and originates enough laughters to satisfy the viewer . The giant Briggite Nielsen -just married to Stallone- is attractive and cold . Friends' couple , Judge Reinhold and John Ashton , are nice and likable . Director Tony Scott stunningly scoring highest marks on action , as the film is correctly made . Motion picture will appeal to action-packed enthusiasts and Eddie Murphy fans.

This is a fun sequel to "Beverly Hills Cop", though lacking somewhat in the creativity of the original. Eddie Murphy however is as kinetic and funny as ever, as he bowls you over with his quick banter, facial expressions, and farcical dialog that you really have to listen for because it doesn't always make sense. Like the idea of a 'sound seeking projectile' - seems reasonable if you hear it quick, but when you analyze it you know right away that it's nonsense. The Gerald Ford bit with Sergeant Taggart (John Ashton) was a head scratcher for this viewer, but apparently the clientele at the Hollywood hangout gave it a standing ovation. The Hugh Hefner cameo was a neat touch as the film gave his Playboy Mansion a huge promo spot; I'm sure business there picked up a notch after the movie came out. Funny, but even while Taggart and Billy (Judge Reinhold) were busted to traffic duty, they never found their way to a busy intersection except to snarl traffic with a handful of vehicle chases. The whole Alphabet case was handled fairly easily here by the reuniting cop trio, with some of the bad guys getting dispatched just a bit too easily. But you can't keep a good franchise down, as the series moves on to another sequel with "Beverly Hills Cop III" in a few more years.

A fun movie with fun characters from a time when movies tried to entertain the viewer.A film like this is almost impossible to make today, with entertaining characters, hilarious villains and a fun story that doesn't tire the viewer but gives him good entertainment.Eddie Murphy is fun, as always, and Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are just as great. Brigitte Nielsen and Jürgen Prochnow are great villains, a really fun combination.The soundtrack is great and completes the movie and makes it even more fun. The films of the eighties really have some special charm and can be watched over and over again.The film is well directed, the cast is excellent, and the soundtrack is absolutely great.A fun movie that is definitely worth watching.

Unfortunately, my video store that I rent at does not have the second Beverly Hills Cop or the third, so when I stopped by Best Buy and saw the sequel for $6.99, I thought it might be worth a buy. After watching this, I was very glad that I bought it. It was great to see our favorite Beverly Hills cop back in action! Eddie Murphy is just so great and hilarious, he can make Charles Manson laugh! Basically, Axel has heard of some horrible crimes going on in Beverly Hills once again, so he comes back to help out the force. With his two favorite cops, Billy and John, only this time, they're a little more gutsy. Now they are after the alphabet crimes, a group of thieves led by the 7 foot tall Bridget Neilson. But it's going to be hard with the chief of Beverly Hills always getting on the trio's butts.I loved Beverly Hills Cop 2, I hope I do find the third one, I know it doesn't have as good of a rating like the first or the second one, but still I love Eddie Murphy. Who could resist that great chuckle of his? Beverly Hills Cop 2 is filled with just as many laughs as the first one and I don't see how anyone could not laugh at least a few times.7/10

Hilarious the whole way through. Enaging and funny without being over the top cheesy.

When Lieutenant Bogomil (Ronny Cox) is gunned down in broad daylight by a mysterious assassin detectives Rosewood and Taggart set to work in trying to find out who was behind the shooting. Upon hearing of the news, Detroit police officer Axel Foley once again reunites with Taggart and Rosewood and assists with their investigations much to the dismay of the chief of police Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield)...Critically, the first Beverley Hills Cop film was a success and has remained a popular film even 30 + years later and having seen it recently I can see why as it had a winning combination of Eddie Murphy at the top of his game and good straight-man support from Reinhold and Ashton plus a serviceable story.What surprised me is that the second film offers all of the same things yet it never seems to get held in the same kind of light at this first film; perhaps the reason is that many purists have the belief that familiarity breeds contempt, but for me sometimes a bit of what you know can be a good thing.I have to concede that there were parts in the early stages of the film that I found to be a little overbearing; we know that Beverly Hills Cop and Murphy are both loud, but for about the first 20-30 minutes it was literally too much at times - I've always been a fan of Eddie Murphy's, but some of his early scenes were a little too loud and shouty and at times some of these moments came across as irritating. Thankfully things improve and settle down when he makes the trip to Beverly Hills which was a relief as I don't think my lugholes could have endure the loudness much longer.Once the investigation begins it does become enjoyable and I have to admit that Axel's ingenuity in getting information from people (whether directly or indirectly) holds no bounds and is always fun to watch. Reinhold and Ashton are great once again in supporting roles and Gil Hill was always a good character who sadly only had a small role in this film.Sadly what does let the film down slightly is Brigitte Nielsen who has never been much of an actress and basically recites her lines as though she's reading them from an autocue and I'm sorry but I never found her that 'sexy' either. Isn't it also interesting that Rosewood had posters of Rambo and Cobra in his house (2 Stallone films) all at the time when Stallone was married to Brigitte Nielsen and she had an affair with Tony Scott. I suspect Nielsen only got the role based on these factors making her appearance all the more uncomfortable and out of place for those who know too much. Prochnow fares better and at least manages to bring a little menace, but Stockwell is weak. Look out for a cameo from Chris Rock at an early point in his career and a more obvious cameo from the late Hugh Hefner.Still despite some off-set issues at least Tony Scott does a relatively good job on-set by providing the audience with plenty of spectacle and some solid action sequences. In my opinion this is every bit as good as the original film and I am a little bit perplexed as to why it seems to be looked upon less favourably than the original film. Simply put if you liked the first film then you'll enjoy this sequel.

I remember waiting in line on May 25, 1987 , opening day, when I was 14 years old eagerly anticipating this movie.Five minutes into the movie my heart sank. This movie was the ultimate glossy, high-powered empty "comedy/action" film. Even at age 14, I could tell this one stunk. Here were some of the reasons I felt this way.1. Eddie Murphy is bitter and angry throughout the movie. There is no joy in this performance. He's constantly yelling and screaming at everybody.Think back to the first movie when he pretended to be gay in order to get into the hotel buffet. He used his wit and intelligence to get himself through the gate. In BVC II he yells and insults everyone who dares to get in his way.2. When did Axl become fishing buddies with Ronny Cox? 3. The character Billy Rosewood becomes a gun nut for no real reason other than the writers thought it would be a funny direction to take the character.This movie could have generated a simple laugh by having Axl still driving around in his old blue Chevy Nova. But no, he's only shown driving a Ferrari and BMW(?)convertible.

While there are many that like this movie, I've seen a lot of people who hate on it too, and I don't understand it. This movie was awesome. I think it's as good as, if not better than the first one. I mean, it delivers on every promise it makes, and it's especially good in comparison with the third film, so just take it for what it is and you'll have a fun time.Axel Foley returns as hip Detroit cop Axel Foley, and this time, he's drawn back to Beverly Hills in order to catch the person who shot Bogomil, and he re-teams with Taggart and Rosewood to do it, as well as solve the infamous "Alphabet Crimes".The film greatly benefits from Tony Scott's masterful direction, and he truly is a virtuoso when it comes to directing action films. I really love some of his other work, particularly his films with Denzel Washington ("Man on Fire", "Deja Vu", "The Taking of Pelham 123", "Unstoppable"), and he crafts some excellent action set-pieces here. While the "Beverly Hills Cop" films have never been accused of being action-heavy, what is here is quite good, particularly the final oil field shootout which was very memorable. I would even go as far as to say that Scott's direction here tops that of Martin Brest, who was responsible for the every bit as good original film.Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, known for their incredibly action-packed, often overblown action films filled with shootouts, chases, explosions, and fight scenes, are producing here, and it has their clear stamp on it, which is great, as they always put out fantastic action movies.As far as comedy goes, it's hilarious, and arguably funnier than the first. Eddie Murphy is just as funny here as in the last one, and there are some laugh-out-loud moments. The feel of the original is still there, and the "fish out of water" aspect of Axel in Beverly Hills is still present, even if it's not as apparent as in the original. His relationship with Taggart and Rosewood is explored further, and both get more background and screen time in this film.As I mentioned earlier, there's not a ton of action, even if some people do say this one's more action-packed than the first one. I'd say both have about the same amount, but even though there's not loads of action, what's here is great. A short shootout outside of a strip club, a cement truck chase, and the final, legendary shootout. Tony Scott really knows how to do action sequences, and his talent is definitely on display here.Everyone played their parts well, and the characters are just as likable here as in the first one. There's a lot of character development, probably more here than in the first, and there's a greater focus on Taggart and Rosewood, which I liked. A great script, excellent cast, and skilled director really made this film soar.A problem that a lot of people had with this one was that it was pretty much just a repeat of the first film, and that very little set this one apart. But honestly, isn't that the point of a sequel? I mean, yes, it would be nice to see a different film, but I don't agree that this is a repeat of the first one. The appeal of a sequel is that, if you liked the first one, then you'll like the sequel. It has the same characters, same plot elements, same actors, but a new situation. It takes everything that people liked about the first one, and adds more to it here. This sequel did have a different situation, although it still had the feel of the first one, which is one of the things that made it so good. But this sequel, instead of focusing on being something different, just decided to build on what made the original so good. It still had the 'average guy in rich Beverly Hills' vibe, it still had the same characters, same personalities, same location, but it developed these aspects more. There's now a greater focus on the lives of Taggart and Rosewood, as well as their relationship with Axel. There's a greater focus on Inspector Todd and the Detroit Police Department. There's more insight into the life of Bogomil. It is a rehash of the original, to a point, but there's more added. Everything that made the original a classic is still here, but there's now more of it. And I think this makes a good sequel. It worked with "Die Hard 2" and "Lethal Weapon 2". Different villains, same characters, same relationships, same action, same humor, different settings.Overall, this film is, at least to me, under-appreciated, and it does a lot of great things. If you've seen the first "Beverly Hills Cop", than you'll like this one. I mean, even the iconic theme and obligatory Pointer Sisters song are here. Watch it, and decide for yourself.

Version I saw: UK DVD releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10It's easy to forget these days, but there was a time when Eddie Murphy was widely acknowledged as one of the funniest men alive. Beverly Hills Cop II is around the zenith of his power, and also that of director Tony Scott.Scott was just coming off Top Gun which, like it or not, is one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and thus incredibly influential. With these films, he practically set the template for 80s Hollywood: big, brash action scenes interspersed with big, brash... everything else.It suits Eddie Murphy perfectly, given that his stage persona is all about being the coolest, biggest personality in the room. Although it presents as a 'fish out of water' story, BHC2 is actually more like the tale of a virus entering a new population that has no immunity to it. Nobody can defend against the motor mouth of Axel, Murphy's character. I sometimes wished someone did in fact, just once, so that he could get out of the situation some other way, but he talked his way out of or into everything perfectly, without fail.It's an enjoyable romp, with a central trio whose friendship I believed in. Scott's fingerprint is visible in the thrilling car chase sequences and (literally) explosive shoot-outs. There's not much depth to it, but you can get that elsewhere, like in the work of Tony Scott's older brother Ridley. Tony (now sadly deceased) did stylish action thrillers, and he did them damn well.

This movie is widely acknowledged as being one of the worst sequels ever. It's the same movie all over again, but without the intelligence, humour and charm that made the first film such a winner.Eddie Murphy returns as fish-out-of-water cop Axel Foley and he's at his loudest and most annoying here, shouting at the top of his lungs and speaking so fast that it's difficult to understand what he's saying (Nutty Professor 2 had the same problem, with those two and "Another 48 Hours" Eddie seems to make a mess of sequels).Director Tony Scott was hired to direct the sequel. He was hot off "Top Gun" the year before, but he's not a comedy director. He gives "Beverly Hills Cop II" his usual glossy look, but he mistimes all of the humour and it shows.You can tell a movie franchise is in trouble when it starts killing off its main characters and that's what happens here when Ronny Cox is shot (Foley's foul-mouthed boss, Inspector Todd, would be killed off in the next movie).Brigitte Nielsen, for the 5 minutes she was on Hollywood's A-list, is in among the cast. She only got the part after Sylvester Stallone invited Eddie Murphy over for dinner (Sly apparently fell under the table laughing at Eddie's Rocky impression).The screenplay for "Beverly Hills Cop" was nominated for an Oscar and that just goes to show you how good the original movie was. This movie got no such recognition. Actor and director Mel Smith once saw this movie at a Royal Premiere in London and he said: "That is the biggest load of cr*p you will ever sit through in your life, I would have left, but you couldn't as there was royalty there." I couldn't agree more. You should only watch this film at gunpoint. Otherwise, don't waste 2 hours of your life that you won't get back.

Beverly Hills Cop is most definitely a classic, and I must say Beverly Hills Cop II lives up to the first one reasonably well. Everything that I enjoyed from the first one was carried on in this one, which is simultaneously a perk and a flaw. A perk because the style of the first was great, but a flaw because it did feel familiar in many respects. There is a little bit of a sense that if you've seen the first one, you've seen the second one. That being said this film is a hoot, and I can't wait to watch the third instalment.The plot is all a bit ludicrous and didn't entirely make sense (to me at any rate). There was nothing too original about the core concept, feeling a bit James Bondy in a way. It wasn't bad at all, and ticked along at a zippy pace, with a good variety of action sequences, comedic moments and sharply scripted scenes. The Beverly Hills Cop films aren't really about the plot though, its all about Eddie Murphy.He is just so god damn funny, and possibly at his comedic acting peak in the 80s. His comedic timing, body language, facial expressions are second to none, making Beverly Hills Cop II hilarious. I actually think the humour was as decent as the first film, its just the plot which doesn't match up in quality. There are several cast members returning from the first instalment, all of whom put in solid performances, but as mentioned its 100% Murphy's film.I also just love the style of 80s films, and Beverly Hills Cop II has so many 80s trademarks. From the soundtrack to the direction to the script. Its just a blast.Any fans of the Beverly Hills Cop franchise or Eddie Murphy in general will for sure love this film. It a bit messy in places but that never detracts from it's numerous triumphs.

The original Beverley Hills Cop is one of those films that remains a cult classic because of the fact that it's such a product of the time it was made. This quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel, made three years later, and although part two; like many sequels, never quite manages that same verve as the original film - it still offers a good time, and anyone that enjoyed the first instalment (and who didn't?) will probably have a good time with this sequel too. All the main players from the original film have been rounded up once again, with Eddie Murphy heading a capable ensemble cast, lots of wisecracks and some gratuitously over the top action sequences. The plot is, as you would expect, superfluous to the style of the film; and much of the movie is simply tailored around it; but anyway, it follows maverick copper Axel Foley and his two California police cronies as they are pulled into a case known as the 'alphabet murders', which involves a robbery, a tall blonde woman and a gun shop owner.I've got to say that Eddie Murphy's wisecracks were a lot funnier in the first film. While they were still over the top, they were at least sort of believable. Here, however, Murphy goes massively over the top, and it's hard to imagine how anyone that obnoxious doesn't end up with a cracked jaw. Anyway, Murphy obviously enjoys himself; and if you can get by the complete lack of logic, you probably will too. True to style, the action is completely over the top too; with several ridiculous sequences combining to make the movie the entertaining blockbuster that it is. The film lacks any kind of themes or substance, meaning that it will both not please serious film fans, and that this reviewer is running out of steam; but I will say that this movie does have a point to make, and that is simply entertaining it's audience. It may be completely silly, illogical fun; but some movies need to be there just to entertain, and this is one of those. I wouldn't recommend sticking this movie at the top of any must see lists, or going into with huge expectations; but it's a good time, that's for sure.

I know this goes against the grain, but I did enjoy this sequel to Beverly Hills Cop more than the original. I was not the biggest fan of the first film, it had its moments, but I did really enjoy this one. This one has Foley returning to Beverly Hills to help the friends he made from the first film solve a set of robberies and a cop getting shot. I do not know, but I enjoyed the story more and I also enjoyed the inclusion of Brigitte Nielsen as the bad guy for the piece. She was rather good for a short stretch, but faded quite fast like a lot of actresses. I enjoyed the chemistry between Murphy, Reinhold and Ashton my favorite scene where Axel (Murphy) and Taggart (Ashton) were discussing Billy (Reinhold) possibly having a problem as he had quite an assortment of weapons and gun paraphernalia. The action in this one is really good too and I like the humor a bit more here too. To me it is a better film, but that is me. Most people like the first one better I imagine, I just thought this one had a bit more substance to it than the first film. I think this one is a wild ride and the cast is comfortable with their roles. I am sure we can all agree that it is a better sequel than the third movie.

I finally saw this sequel and it was better than what many people say. Murphy has some very hilarious moments and Reinhold and Ashton were just as good.  Also, the action scene's were decent too, though the chase with the cement truck was'nt as good as the chase in the first with the transport truck.  I did notice that the film lacked the freshness of the first one but still it was fun to watch.

Sequel to the hugely successful 1984 movies, this film was most unfairly slated by critics. I believe in some ways it is better than the original and certainly far, far better than the third installment. The story is, despite what everyone says, very engaging and keeps you watching the whole time. Eddie Murphy starred in Coming to America shortly after this, and then his career took a nosedive, although he seems to be making a comeback. If he is given more roles like this, he'll do better.

Beverly Hills Cop 2 is pretty much just the same as the original Beverly Hills Cop but without the freshness and originality of the 1st. Murphy is still a perfect Axel Foley and with some good supporting characters such as his foul mouthed chief of police and Detectives Rosewood and Taggart the movie does have it's moments but the rules of diminishing returns still apply.With a bit more originality in the script and a bit more daring this really could have been great. But for a sequel this isn't to bad just more of the same but not quite as good.6/10 - Not as good as the original but far superior to the tepid third instalment.

Long ago, when Eddie Murphy was the biggest star in Hollywood, Beverly Hills Cop 2 was the most anticipated film of 1987. Movies like Trading Places and 48 Hours made Murphy famous. But Axel Foley made him a superstar. Impressed by Top Gun (even though it's a truly awful film), Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer brought Tony Scott on board to direct. What they forgot to do was polish the script.Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help solve 'The Alphabet Crimes' after his old pal Lt. Bogomil is gunned down in the street. With Taggart and Rosewood in tow (now actually doing police work instead of standing by) Axel uncovers a seriously convoluted conspiracy.The story should have taken a back seat to allow Murphy to work over the massive holes in the plot with his distracting wisecracks. I won't lie to you, there are some utterly horrible contrivances in BHC2 (Bogomil's daughter digging up dirt at the insurance company she just happens to work at is honestly the most obnoxious movie coincidence of all time), but you'll just have to suffer them.This might have been easy to overlook, but Tony Scott, still finding his feet as a director, and his editors turn a great deal of the film into an incomprehensible mess. Some of the continuity errors are just baffling (where did Rosewood get the coffee cup from at the night club crash scene?) and it makes the action quite hard to follow.However, Tony Scott's highly visual style of filmmaking is far more suiting to this kind of environment. The wealth and decadence of late 80s California is all over this movie, and it's the only aspect where it improves on the original. I doubt the latter day Scott would make the movie this way, but it's definitely the best looking of the trilogy. It's also the only one to be shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio (however it's Super35 instead of the superior anamorphic Panavision format).

Yes, I know that sounds a bit hyperbole, but the opening jewel robbery, seguing directly into Eddie Murphy dressing for work with Bob Seger's "Shakedown" in the background is one of the best film openings I have ever seen.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just average, and is nowhere near as good as the original. If you don't want to sit though the whole movie, at least try to catch the opening few minutes on YouTube, if you can.

Beverly Hills Cop II is definitely my all time favorite Action comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop (1984) will always be the best and my all time favorite film that I love to death. That is why I just love the sequel much more and I have always enjoyed this film much better than the original film I did. Here Axel Foley,Billy Rosewood and John Taggart works as a team than they did in the first film. This time Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help Taggart and Rosewood investigate Chief Bogomil's near-fatal shooting and the series of strange robberies "alphabet crimes" associated with it. Axel Foley comes back which he reunites with Detective Billy Rosewood and Detective Sergeant John Taggart.I love the Action sequences they are all great , humor , suspense , tongue in cheek, shoot'em up and is developed in agility and movement and for that reason is amusing. They are all great, there isn't any cgi in it. Whole cast did a great job. It is my all time favorite sequel to the first film. I seriously I love this film to death and I always have enjoyed so much. I still don't get it why all the hate for this film? The third film was really the worst in the series but I still like it and I will still watch it. Eddie Murphy did a great job as a Detroit detective Axel Foley, he did acted very well. Yes he was shouting one everyone I saw that, but there are things in the film that people didn't noticed. After his friend Captain Andrew Bogomil was shot he didn't hesitate to come to Beverly Hills and helping him out. He cared more about his friend than anyone else did. He hustle Maxwell Dent accountant Sidney Bernstein for $200 but, he later donated the money for Beverly Hills homeless people. He could spend the money but he donated. After he took Billy's vitamins and he bluff out the secretary in Beverly Hills Gun Club for money and he throw the vitamins away. he gave the money back to Billy for the vitamins he throw away! I thought that was very nice. Judge Reinhold as Detective Billy Rosewood did a wonderful job and a support in the main cast along side Axel Foley. He was crazy with guns which I love it. We see poster from Stallone's Cobra and Rambo: First Blood Part II in Billy's apartment. I love how he was driving the car and caring so much guns with him. He had a turtle in his apartment awesome. John Ashton as Detective Sergeant John Taggart did a pretty good job as detective helping and solving a Alphabet crime he was awesome. Brigitte Nielsen as Karla Fry did a wonderful job as villainies and it was one of her best roles I have ever seen. Jürgen Prochnow as Maxwell Dent was fantastic villain much better than Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks in the first movie did. Dean Stockwell as Charles "Chip" Cain did a fantastic job as Dent henchman. Allen Garfield as Chief Harold Lutz was fantastic he was so load and funny I was keep laughing at his performance. The Last and at least the best small role that had was Ronny Cox I seriously I love him in this film. He doesn't do much but his still a good as Andrew Bogomil we finally found out that he has a daughter Jan and she is very beautiful. There are other faces in this film like are Hugh Hefner who plays himself, Chris Rock has a small cameo in it.Gilbert Hill as Inspector G. Douglas Todd and Paul Reiser as Detective Jeffrey Friedman also return from the first film and they also do have a few scenes in the film.In the original movie they were only in the beginning of the film than they were cut off from the rest of the film. I seriously think Tony Scott did a wonderful job filming this decent awesome Action Comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop II is a 1987 action comedy film starring Eddie Murphy and directed by Tony Scott. It is the sequel to the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop and the second installment in the Beverly Hills Cop series.Although it made less money than the original Beverly Hills Cop and received mixed reviews from critics, the film was still a box office success, making $153,665,036 domestically.I love this film to death!!! I love this film to death! it will always stay in my heart! I love the shooting, action, car chases, playboy girls everything in this film. I love Eddie Murphy! I also love the main theme for Axel Foley from Harold Faltermeyer and songs a Better Way" - James Ingram,Shakedown" - Bob Seger and Hold On" by Corey Hart.

After the original hit so big in 84 it was inevitable (and to a 14 year old like me) quite welcome that a sequel would be cobbled together. The surprising part of it all is that this film is almost as good as the first, and despite being panned mercilessly by many it remains one of my favourite guilty pleasures from the 80s. In fact I probably know this film better than the original.Axel Foley is once again drawn back to Beverly Hills from his cosy, dangerous rut in Detroit – much to his superior Detective Todd's chagrin. This time he is there to uncover just who is responsible for Lt Bogomil being gunned down there. (One photo of a fishing trip is enough to inform us that between the first and second film the Beverly Hills Police crew and Axel have become fast friends.) The mechanics of the sequel demand that it be more elaborate, so this time Axel, Taggert and Rosewood find themselves on the trail of the Alphabet criminals, so called for leaving clues in the form of letters and performing their crimes alphabetically – wonder how they would have gone if they made it to 'Q'? With the characters already introduced and by this stage well-defined, all that is left is to get into it. The sequel has a soundtrack that is almost as good as the original, action sequences that hurtle along almost as well, and better criminal big wigs in the form of Jurgen Prochnow and unfathomably tall and blond Bridget Neilson.It seems to me that the first two Beverly Hills Cop films were taken very seriously by the filmmakers, with no Martin Brest at the helm a savvy move was made to put Tony Scott behind the wheel, a man that can make reading the phone book more adrenalising and somehow exciting.The last 45 minutes of BHC2 is in fact almost one long unbroken action sequence, with chase scene after chase scene, most only broken up to pause while Axel breaks out another character voice to bluff his way into or out of trouble.The pacing of the sequel is probably better than the original, thanks again to the fact that Scott didn't need to bother us with character development, and the series of coincidences and fluke meetings that hold the plot together are forgivable given just how entertaining the rest of the film is.Final Rating – 8 / 10. OK it isn't all-time great and it relies on Murphy's charm to smooth over some dull spots, but this remains undeniably rewatchable and continues to amuse.

I love Eddie Murphy, but this is a very weak vehicle for his talents. Sure, he's got some good scenes and some good lines, the eighties vibes is a blast, the music was very good, and we see cameos from lots of Murphy's comedian friends, including a very young Chris Rock; but the sum total is very modest. The movie is one Hollywood cliché after another, with endless dumb chase scenes, a police commissioner who says the same things in every scene, and a lame plot. His two buddies are predictable. Eddie Murphy was fresh and gritty and unpredictable in Beverly Hills Cop and 48 Hours, Trading Places, Coming to America, Bowfinger and other films. But on this one they went for a formula, and it falls flat.

"Beverly Hills Cop II" is the entertaining sequel to the 1984 smash hit. Of course, this sequel can't top the original, but it's still pretty good. Eddie Murphy returns as Axel Foley and returns to Beverly Hills to help avenge the attack of a friend. This movie isn't as fresh as the original movie, but I found myself laughing alot throughout. Plus, the action scenes are well done. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, and Paul Reiser all reprise their roles from the first film along with Murphy. "Beverly Hills Cop II" is a movie that's loud and noisy at times, but it's funny and entertaining. And it's much better than the disappointing third movie in the series, "Beverly Hills Cop III".*** (out of four)

Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) returns to Beverly Hills to help Taggart (John Ashton) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) investigate Chief Bogamil's near-fatal shooting and the series of "alphabet crimes" associated with it.So, how do you top the greatest action comedy of all time? You bring in director Tony Scott ("Top Gun") to spruce up the action, car chases and explosions. You also improve Judge Reinhold's character. In the first film, he was more or less just background. Here, he has a personality and is even more eccentric than Foley himself! I did like the nods to Sylvester Stallone. Casting his wife, putting his posters up all over... it was like a consolation prize for backing out of the first film.

Beverly Hills Cop is a classic, but this one while not awful was a disappointment in comparison. The set pieces are spectacular, Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold are good together and individually, Jurgen Prochnov and Brigitte Nielson suitably ham it up, the film is assuredly directed and it moves briskly. However, what is missing is a good enough story and a decent script. The story is sadly quite predictable, and the script is also unfunny and lacking sorely in wit. The soundtrack isn't as memorable either and while flashy some of the production values make little impact. Overall, it is okay but in comparison to the wonderful original it is lacking. 5/10 Bethany Cox

Beverly Hills Cop is my favorite comedy of all time, and its reputation as a classic of 1980s cinema is well earned. Its two sequels, however, are not held in as in high regard. The two follow-ups are often lumped together as lackluster efforts, which isn't fair since while Beverly Hills Cop II isn't a comedic masterpiece like the first one, it's the definitely the much stronger sequel. Having just watched the film for the first time in years, I found it to be a whole lot better than I remember. In fact, I'd say it's a quite an underrated sequel.The best decision made by director Tony Scott and the creative team behind Beverly Hills Cop II was to bring back almost all the actors from the first movie. Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, Gilbert Hill, and Paul Reiser are just as great here as they were in the original. Unlike with most sequels, nobody on screen appears to be phoning in a performance for a paycheck. The main trio of Murphy, Reinhold, and Ashton are together for a good 80% of the film, and are absolutely perfect together. The three actors share amazing chemistry as a group, making every scene with them a blast to watch. The fact that their friendship feels real is what elevates Beverly Hills Cop II from ever feeling like just an unnecessary sequel. Beverly Hills Cop II has some of the same story beats as Beverly Hills Cop, but it never comes across as a lazy retread. The best parts of Beverly Hills Cop II are the noticeable differences from the first film. Rather than having to solve the murder of a friend, Axel must discover who shot Bogomil (Cox). Tony Scott gets a bit of suspense out of whether Bogomil will live or die, and there's a few surprisingly touching scenes between Axel and Bogomil's daughter. These scenes could have felt out of place in what is mostly a comedy, but they work quite well. What really separates Beverly Hills Cop II from the first one, as well as from most action movies in general, is that the main villain is a very intimidating woman, Karla Fry (Bridgitte Nielsen). There has been some criticism that the treatment of her character is misogynistic, though I've never seen much to support that argument. She may not be the most three-dimensional character every written, but the fact that we don't learn all that much about her makes her even more menacing. One of the best aspects to the story is that there is a hierarchy of villains. In addition to Karla, there's also the memorable Maxwell Dent (Jurgen Prochnow). The scene where Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart track down Max at the Playboy Mansion is the film's highlight, and one of the funniest scenes in any movie ever. Almost every single line in the scene is hilarious, Chris Rock gets a cool little cameo, and the scene somehow manages to be feel completely relevant to the plot. However, the Playboy Mansion scene also draws attention to the one major flaw of Beverly Hills Cop II that keeps it from being a truly great movie: the noticeably rough editing. Martin Brest has been quoted as saying that Beverly Hills Cop was saved in the editing room, and that he was amazed at how well everything cut together. Beverly Hills Cop II should have been looked at more closely in the editing room, because it is far from seamless. Several scenes seem to end randomly without any much sense of transition or rhythm. In some instances, the editing is just downright awkward. The best example of this is in the Playboy Mansion scene. Once Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart have left the mansion and the narrative of the scene is effectively over, the camera lingers on a random party-goer dancing enthusiastically to some music. The guy's dance moves are mildly amusing, but there is no real reason for the shot to be in the movie, and it feels extremely disconnected from the rest of the scene. Beverly Hills Cop II is filled with moments in which scenes don't cut at a logical endpoint. There are three credited editors, no doubt the result of a rushed post-production schedule to get the movie out by a certain release date. None of the bad editing kills my overall enjoyment of the film, though it's impossible not to be distracted by its shoddiness at times.With the exception of the poor editing, it's clear there was actually effort and care put into Beverly Hills Cop II, something that can't be said for sequels made in today's era. Just like with the original Beverly Hills Cop, this sequel has tremendous replay value. Though it might not be as well put together as its predecessor, Beverly Hills Cop II still works way, way better than 95% of sequels to classic comedies. 8/10

In this second film about notorious Detroit detective , the foul-mouth and tough Axel Foley (Edddie Murphy) again returns at Beverly Hills to resolve the responsible for the murder of his chief (Ronny Cox) who has been gunned down by a tall woman (Brigitte Nielsen). He decides to track down and clues lead to alphabet robberies that are masterminded by a weapons kingpin . As always , he's helped by a pair of sympathetics mates (Judge Reinhold and John Ashton) . They'll have to confront evil nasties (Jurgen Prochnow and Dean Stockwell) and hold numerous risks , odds and dangers . The picture is plenty of action , humor , suspense , tongue in cheek, shoot'em up and is developed in agility and movement and for that reason is amusing . The picture provides fast and furious amusement with spectacular scenes and unstopped-action. Relief comic is in charge of Eddie Murphy as his foul and fast-talking creates most big smiles and causing wreak havoc on the way . Besides his various jokes with the sidekicks steal enormous laughs . For that the picture is a ¨Buddy movie¨ though there's a trio protagonist . Eddie Murphy as streetsmart detective is top-notch, as Axel Foley is his greatest smash-hit and converted him in a top-international-star confirming his position with continued successes in the box office . Fish out water formula used in several films is well narrated and originates enough laughters to satisfy the viewer . The giant Briggite Nielsen -just married to Stallone- is attractive and cold . Friends' couple , Judge Reinhold and John Ashton , are nice and likable . Director Tony Scott stunningly scoring highest marks on action , as the film is correctly made . Motion picture will appeal to action-packed enthusiasts and Eddie Murphy fans.

This is a fun sequel to "Beverly Hills Cop", though lacking somewhat in the creativity of the original. Eddie Murphy however is as kinetic and funny as ever, as he bowls you over with his quick banter, facial expressions, and farcical dialog that you really have to listen for because it doesn't always make sense. Like the idea of a 'sound seeking projectile' - seems reasonable if you hear it quick, but when you analyze it you know right away that it's nonsense. The Gerald Ford bit with Sergeant Taggart (John Ashton) was a head scratcher for this viewer, but apparently the clientele at the Hollywood hangout gave it a standing ovation. The Hugh Hefner cameo was a neat touch as the film gave his Playboy Mansion a huge promo spot; I'm sure business there picked up a notch after the movie came out. Funny, but even while Taggart and Billy (Judge Reinhold) were busted to traffic duty, they never found their way to a busy intersection except to snarl traffic with a handful of vehicle chases. The whole Alphabet case was handled fairly easily here by the reuniting cop trio, with some of the bad guys getting dispatched just a bit too easily. But you can't keep a good franchise down, as the series moves on to another sequel with "Beverly Hills Cop III" in a few more years.

A fun movie with fun characters from a time when movies tried to entertain the viewer.A film like this is almost impossible to make today, with entertaining characters, hilarious villains and a fun story that doesn't tire the viewer but gives him good entertainment.Eddie Murphy is fun, as always, and Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are just as great. Brigitte Nielsen and Jürgen Prochnow are great villains, a really fun combination.The soundtrack is great and completes the movie and makes it even more fun. The films of the eighties really have some special charm and can be watched over and over again.The film is well directed, the cast is excellent, and the soundtrack is absolutely great.A fun movie that is definitely worth watching.

Unfortunately, my video store that I rent at does not have the second Beverly Hills Cop or the third, so when I stopped by Best Buy and saw the sequel for $6.99, I thought it might be worth a buy. After watching this, I was very glad that I bought it. It was great to see our favorite Beverly Hills cop back in action! Eddie Murphy is just so great and hilarious, he can make Charles Manson laugh! Basically, Axel has heard of some horrible crimes going on in Beverly Hills once again, so he comes back to help out the force. With his two favorite cops, Billy and John, only this time, they're a little more gutsy. Now they are after the alphabet crimes, a group of thieves led by the 7 foot tall Bridget Neilson. But it's going to be hard with the chief of Beverly Hills always getting on the trio's butts.I loved Beverly Hills Cop 2, I hope I do find the third one, I know it doesn't have as good of a rating like the first or the second one, but still I love Eddie Murphy. Who could resist that great chuckle of his? Beverly Hills Cop 2 is filled with just as many laughs as the first one and I don't see how anyone could not laugh at least a few times.7/10

Hilarious the whole way through. Enaging and funny without being over the top cheesy.

When Lieutenant Bogomil (Ronny Cox) is gunned down in broad daylight by a mysterious assassin detectives Rosewood and Taggart set to work in trying to find out who was behind the shooting. Upon hearing of the news, Detroit police officer Axel Foley once again reunites with Taggart and Rosewood and assists with their investigations much to the dismay of the chief of police Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield)...Critically, the first Beverley Hills Cop film was a success and has remained a popular film even 30 + years later and having seen it recently I can see why as it had a winning combination of Eddie Murphy at the top of his game and good straight-man support from Reinhold and Ashton plus a serviceable story.What surprised me is that the second film offers all of the same things yet it never seems to get held in the same kind of light at this first film; perhaps the reason is that many purists have the belief that familiarity breeds contempt, but for me sometimes a bit of what you know can be a good thing.I have to concede that there were parts in the early stages of the film that I found to be a little overbearing; we know that Beverly Hills Cop and Murphy are both loud, but for about the first 20-30 minutes it was literally too much at times - I've always been a fan of Eddie Murphy's, but some of his early scenes were a little too loud and shouty and at times some of these moments came across as irritating. Thankfully things improve and settle down when he makes the trip to Beverly Hills which was a relief as I don't think my lugholes could have endure the loudness much longer.Once the investigation begins it does become enjoyable and I have to admit that Axel's ingenuity in getting information from people (whether directly or indirectly) holds no bounds and is always fun to watch. Reinhold and Ashton are great once again in supporting roles and Gil Hill was always a good character who sadly only had a small role in this film.Sadly what does let the film down slightly is Brigitte Nielsen who has never been much of an actress and basically recites her lines as though she's reading them from an autocue and I'm sorry but I never found her that 'sexy' either. Isn't it also interesting that Rosewood had posters of Rambo and Cobra in his house (2 Stallone films) all at the time when Stallone was married to Brigitte Nielsen and she had an affair with Tony Scott. I suspect Nielsen only got the role based on these factors making her appearance all the more uncomfortable and out of place for those who know too much. Prochnow fares better and at least manages to bring a little menace, but Stockwell is weak. Look out for a cameo from Chris Rock at an early point in his career and a more obvious cameo from the late Hugh Hefner.Still despite some off-set issues at least Tony Scott does a relatively good job on-set by providing the audience with plenty of spectacle and some solid action sequences. In my opinion this is every bit as good as the original film and I am a little bit perplexed as to why it seems to be looked upon less favourably than the original film. Simply put if you liked the first film then you'll enjoy this sequel.

I remember waiting in line on May 25, 1987 , opening day, when I was 14 years old eagerly anticipating this movie.Five minutes into the movie my heart sank. This movie was the ultimate glossy, high-powered empty "comedy/action" film. Even at age 14, I could tell this one stunk. Here were some of the reasons I felt this way.1. Eddie Murphy is bitter and angry throughout the movie. There is no joy in this performance. He's constantly yelling and screaming at everybody.Think back to the first movie when he pretended to be gay in order to get into the hotel buffet. He used his wit and intelligence to get himself through the gate. In BVC II he yells and insults everyone who dares to get in his way.2. When did Axl become fishing buddies with Ronny Cox? 3. The character Billy Rosewood becomes a gun nut for no real reason other than the writers thought it would be a funny direction to take the character.This movie could have generated a simple laugh by having Axl still driving around in his old blue Chevy Nova. But no, he's only shown driving a Ferrari and BMW(?)convertible.

While there are many that like this movie, I've seen a lot of people who hate on it too, and I don't understand it. This movie was awesome. I think it's as good as, if not better than the first one. I mean, it delivers on every promise it makes, and it's especially good in comparison with the third film, so just take it for what it is and you'll have a fun time.Axel Foley returns as hip Detroit cop Axel Foley, and this time, he's drawn back to Beverly Hills in order to catch the person who shot Bogomil, and he re-teams with Taggart and Rosewood to do it, as well as solve the infamous "Alphabet Crimes".The film greatly benefits from Tony Scott's masterful direction, and he truly is a virtuoso when it comes to directing action films. I really love some of his other work, particularly his films with Denzel Washington ("Man on Fire", "Deja Vu", "The Taking of Pelham 123", "Unstoppable"), and he crafts some excellent action set-pieces here. While the "Beverly Hills Cop" films have never been accused of being action-heavy, what is here is quite good, particularly the final oil field shootout which was very memorable. I would even go as far as to say that Scott's direction here tops that of Martin Brest, who was responsible for the every bit as good original film.Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, known for their incredibly action-packed, often overblown action films filled with shootouts, chases, explosions, and fight scenes, are producing here, and it has their clear stamp on it, which is great, as they always put out fantastic action movies.As far as comedy goes, it's hilarious, and arguably funnier than the first. Eddie Murphy is just as funny here as in the last one, and there are some laugh-out-loud moments. The feel of the original is still there, and the "fish out of water" aspect of Axel in Beverly Hills is still present, even if it's not as apparent as in the original. His relationship with Taggart and Rosewood is explored further, and both get more background and screen time in this film.As I mentioned earlier, there's not a ton of action, even if some people do say this one's more action-packed than the first one. I'd say both have about the same amount, but even though there's not loads of action, what's here is great. A short shootout outside of a strip club, a cement truck chase, and the final, legendary shootout. Tony Scott really knows how to do action sequences, and his talent is definitely on display here.Everyone played their parts well, and the characters are just as likable here as in the first one. There's a lot of character development, probably more here than in the first, and there's a greater focus on Taggart and Rosewood, which I liked. A great script, excellent cast, and skilled director really made this film soar.A problem that a lot of people had with this one was that it was pretty much just a repeat of the first film, and that very little set this one apart. But honestly, isn't that the point of a sequel? I mean, yes, it would be nice to see a different film, but I don't agree that this is a repeat of the first one. The appeal of a sequel is that, if you liked the first one, then you'll like the sequel. It has the same characters, same plot elements, same actors, but a new situation. It takes everything that people liked about the first one, and adds more to it here. This sequel did have a different situation, although it still had the feel of the first one, which is one of the things that made it so good. But this sequel, instead of focusing on being something different, just decided to build on what made the original so good. It still had the 'average guy in rich Beverly Hills' vibe, it still had the same characters, same personalities, same location, but it developed these aspects more. There's now a greater focus on the lives of Taggart and Rosewood, as well as their relationship with Axel. There's a greater focus on Inspector Todd and the Detroit Police Department. There's more insight into the life of Bogomil. It is a rehash of the original, to a point, but there's more added. Everything that made the original a classic is still here, but there's now more of it. And I think this makes a good sequel. It worked with "Die Hard 2" and "Lethal Weapon 2". Different villains, same characters, same relationships, same action, same humor, different settings.Overall, this film is, at least to me, under-appreciated, and it does a lot of great things. If you've seen the first "Beverly Hills Cop", than you'll like this one. I mean, even the iconic theme and obligatory Pointer Sisters song are here. Watch it, and decide for yourself.

Its not bad, but it clearly doesn't have the heart of the first one.they tried to follow the formula of the first movie and also make it a bit bigger. but:
Eddy murphy is more annoying than funnythe sexism is more and more clearthe characters overall are more there for short laughsthe world of the movie moved from some what realistic aproach to a funnier is better, it does'nt have to connect to something else.

This movie is widely acknowledged as being one of the worst sequels ever. It's the same movie all over again, but without the intelligence, humour and charm that made the first film such a winner.Eddie Murphy returns as fish-out-of-water cop Axel Foley and he's at his loudest and most annoying here, shouting at the top of his lungs and speaking so fast that it's difficult to understand what he's saying (Nutty Professor 2 had the same problem, with those two and "Another 48 Hours" Eddie seems to make a mess of sequels).Director Tony Scott was hired to direct the sequel. He was hot off "Top Gun" the year before, but he's not a comedy director. He gives "Beverly Hills Cop II" his usual glossy look, but he mistimes all of the humour and it shows.You can tell a movie franchise is in trouble when it starts killing off its main characters and that's what happens here when Ronny Cox is shot (Foley's foul-mouthed boss, Inspector Todd, would be killed off in the next movie).Brigitte Nielsen, for the 5 minutes she was on Hollywood's A-list, is in among the cast. She only got the part after Sylvester Stallone invited Eddie Murphy over for dinner (Sly apparently fell under the table laughing at Eddie's Rocky impression).The screenplay for "Beverly Hills Cop" was nominated for an Oscar and that just goes to show you how good the original movie was. This movie got no such recognition. Actor and director Mel Smith once saw this movie at a Royal Premiere in London and he said: "That is the biggest load of cr*p you will ever sit through in your life, I would have left, but you couldn't as there was royalty there." I couldn't agree more. You should only watch this film at gunpoint. Otherwise, don't waste 2 hours of your life that you won't get back.
