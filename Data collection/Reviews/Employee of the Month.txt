Keep watching this over and over. Dax Shepard was the real star of this movie.

I was hardly amused when I saw the previews for this movie. It didn't look that good, I'm not that big of a Dane Cook fan (and in no way a Jessica Simpson fan), and I didn't enjoy "Waiting" too much (though I'm not sure how much that relates). This movie has more wit than it knows what to do with, and I laughed out loud numerous times. All the acting was spectacular and I was surprised to find that the writing had equal amounts of humor and heart.To come into it thinking it was going to be terrible and coming out thinking it was one of the better movies I've seen in a while, I'd say that's an accomplishment. Though its only my opinion of course, check it out if your curious.

I didnt hate this movie. Actually was
Kinda funny. No its not winning any awards or go down as one of the greats... But its An easy watch and doesnt take much to follow it. If you are needing something funny and simple to watch, there are way worse choices out there. Good movie and dont forget to vote for Pedro!

(Synopsis) Vince Downey (Dax Shepard) is the head cashier and winner of 17 consecutive Employee of the Month awards at Super Club. If he wins one more Employee of the Month, he will be put in the Super Club's Hall of Fame and win a new car. Zack Bradley (Dane Cook), who is the ultimate slacker, has been working at the Super Club for 10 years, and is still at the bottom job, working as a box boy. Then Amy (Jessica Simpson) enters the picture; she is a new cashier transferring in from another Super Club store. Amy has a reputation of dating men who have won Employee of the Month at the other store, so Vince and Zack want to date Amy. The fight is on to win Employee of the Month! (My Comment) Well it sounds like it could be a good movie, but you would be wrong. This film's stupid humor is crude and silly and to that end, it was made to please the young crowd. By the TV commercials, you would think that Jessica Simpson had a major role in the movie, again you would be wrong. Jessica had about 6 scenes in the whole movie, and those were not very impressive. The film did not capitalize on the rivalry between Zack and Vince to a point where it was real. You knew the story before it happened and who was going to get the girl. You can skip this, because it isn't worth the ticket price. (Lionsgate, Run time 1:43, Rated PG-13)(3/10)

Yes it's basic in the American way, they knock out theses movies almost every year. But Dane Cook is ok and Jesica Simpson is not terrible. Its more the support cast that make this enjoyable, mostly Dax Shepard & Efren Ramirez seens together that put a real smile on my face

Zack Bradley and Vince Downey (Dane Cook, Dax Shepard) are employees of the Super Club retail chain who already don't get along, except that Zack is a slacker box boy, while Vince is the chain's star cashier who has been Employee of the Month for 17 years straight. When a pretty cashier named Amy (Jessica Simpson) shows up at the store, the competition heats up as Zack is hell-bent on beating Vince to win the coveted award and the heart of Amy.Employee of the Month turned out to be a lot better than the preview promised although it's still a bland comedy with only a few funny characters and moments. The biggest problem is the staleness of the script. It is best described as hit or miss. Some of the jokes were pretty funny while some jokes felt like a cheap move for laughs and felt quite short at being funny. While the plot was a little inventive, the scenario started to run out of steam because there are only so many laughs you can get out of this type of premise. It would have worked better as a shorter skit because an hour and forty minutes felt too long at times. Also as a romantic comedy, the film completely failed. If you do give it a shot, treat it as a simple comedy with a romantic subplot or else you may be wondering who's in the real relationship.Dane Cook gave an okay performance. He had a few funny scenes and then he failed to show charisma in a few other ones. Jessica Simpson was awful and she showed no character. Her performance was very blah and she made the romance between her and Dane appear very weak. There was no chemistry between them and once you get past Jessica's looks, you don't get much. Dax Shepard was pretty good and he did a lot with generic material. His sidekick, Efren Ramirez was also pretty good and he had some great scenes with Dax. Andy Dick was incredibly unfunny and annoying. Harland Williams was equally bad although not as annoying. Overall, Employee of the Month is a bland and harmless comedy that's only worth checking out if you're a huge fan of Dax Shepard or Dane Cook. Rating 5/10

This film was obviously shot in a Costco. It is a fun couple of hours. The characters are exaggerated which makes the movie comical. The store manger wouldn't hold his job under normal circumstances, so they make him the brother of the owner. The store owner is even more bizarre. Like I said, fun to watch.

Honestly, I think this movie has aged pretty poorly, their treatment of women, POC, and possibly people with disabilities is really quite bad. Dane cook who is supposed to be the protagonist learns nothing, is crappy to his friends, and gets the girl by default because his misogyny is more low key? Also the movie is based on characters we learn nothing about. There's literally a conversation where Jessica Simpson and Dane cook are like "you're not like other boys/girls" but give no information about how/why this is the case. Some low key funny moments but mostly good if you want to laugh at how bad and nonsensical it is. I do want to give a shout-out to the grandma who was the best part of the movie and the lift operator who made their hideout possible but never got any credit.

Dane Cook is so great; I miss his movies he doesn't seem to be in as much as anymore. One of those type not many appreciated probably cause it's a bit obnoxious and silly in a clumsy way but I love that sort of thing! Fun mindless entertainment that doesn't have to be taken seriously. Also the soundtrack is pretty enjoyable.

I think the movie was excellent, Dane Cook is a good actor and a very good comedian. It is a good and relaxing comedy, it wasn't that great, however there were a few original things like the secret hiding place in the mall...who would of thought this could exist in a store or supermarket...whatever u wanna' call it... The casting is good. Jessica is just playing her role, but it isn't that spectacular, she doesn't appear as much as many of you would of thought, but anyway she does her job well enough. She smiles, giggles and looks hot... Dane is the character that makes the movie worth while and i loved the employee of the month stars ... it was a bit predictable that he would win, even if in the end the ,,bad guy'' was actually the winner... but the guard seeing the video tape...you knew that something suspicious would come up... Anyway...a nice comedy with plenty of laughter...I saw it with my friends and you should to, it is well-worth seeing and most of all it is good because i love Dane and his ideas and also I enjoyed the fact that Andy Dick was in the cast...i like him very much from Radio News...so...u should see this flick...I'd give it a solid 7.5 for effort and comic moments and the plot, original as well... Go Dane Go !!!

I had absolutely no interest what so ever in seeing Employee of the Month, let's face it, Jessica Simpson does not equal movie of the year. But my friends and I were stuck inside yesterday and my friend's brother rented Employee of the Month and said that it was pretty funny, so we decided to watch it. While I admit there were a few funny moments, it's the same pointless humor that you see in an average comedy. Jessica, well, even though she wasn't horrible, she wasn't that much of an addition to the cast, her part was just smiles and giggles, so it wasn't that much of a part.Basically, Guy is an employee at a "Sam's Club" sort of speak, only he doesn't take his work very seriously, Vince is the only employee who goes above and beyond his work making employee of the month for 17 months in a row and is about to win a car if he wins employee of the month once again. But all that changes when a new girl, Amy, starts working with them and now Guy and Vince are competing for employee of the month since they heard about Amy only liking the best workers. But Guy is about to... you guessed it... loose touch with who he really is and same with loosing his friends.While it's a pretty stupid movie, I have to admit that I had a few laughs here and there, it's silly humor, but it's all good. But I'm very serious and not just saying this, Jessica really needs to stay away from film because she doesn't add much to the screen besides incredibly low cut tops for the teenage boys. But this is one of those movies you have to decide for yourself, because if I actually had a few laughs, I'm not sure if my brain is functioning correctly.4/10

Although, I am a big Dane Cook fan, I was very disappointed in this movie. A former warehouse store employee during my college years, I was able to relate to the movie a little more than some people. I think it would have been a much better movie with some small story line changes and most of all...if they had another actress...any other actress...playing the role of Amy. I was somewhat shocked that a "superstar" like Jessica Simpson, could be so horrible in a movie. I mean any other actress that is that bad would never get any type of role. She was bland, boring, not funny and even unattractive in this movie. Although I am a "former" Jessica Simpson fan, I am embarrassed that I even wanted to see this movie. She has disappointed once again. Let's all hope Hollywood wakes up and realizes that "tabloid star" does not equal "movie star".

This movie is just a chill, laid back, comedy. No, it's not the funniest movie I've ever seen, but it certainly did have its moments.I found myself really attached to Dane Cook's character, Zack. He is the archetypal good guy with a sweet heart who discovers his worth at the end of the movie. Dax Shepard had the most notable performance in the movie. He was true to his character, Vince, and played it well.There are some good messages in this movie like: never turn your back on your friends.This is a good movie that I would recommend to a friend and would watch again.

If my son didn't have to review this movie for his high school newspaper, I definitely would not have seen it. As I have, here goes: Boy meets girl at Costco, boy loses girl, boy redeems self, boy wins girl back. In between are some minor minor laughs and sight gags, a promising leading man in Dane Cook (and not bad to look at), and Jessica Simpson saying, thankfully, very little. Dane Cook is personable and hopefully this will serve as a jumping board to bigger and better things. And Dax Shepard was, believe it or not, pretty decent as Villain Vince. Cook is a former dot com-mer who has become a professional slacker at the local Costco/Super Store and lives with his grandmother. At his place of employment is a professional jerk named Vince who is on target (no pun intended) to win his 18th employee of the month award. Jessica Simpson walks in and both vie to get in her pants, um I mean vie for her affections. And both try to do this by winning the next employee of the month award. Not even a good date movie. (If that's your goal, save some money and rent "Meet Joe Black.")

Much better, actually. The surprising thing was that my wife and I rented this movie along with Wedding Crashers and we watched them both the same night. We ended up turning off Wedding Crashers after too many groan-inducing scenes, but watched Employee of the Month all the way through and laughed at most of the jokes, which was the opposite of what I expected to happen. Employee of the Month is not what I would call a "good" movie. The acting is mediocre, the plot is very simple and the humor is, at times, crude. And, of course, Jessica Simpson is a horrible actress. But they didn't use her as much more than a pretty face for the the hero and villain to fight over, so I hated her much less than I thought I would. Many of the scenarios are over the top and unbelievable, but I found that to be another joke aimed at the big warehouse chains themselves, not just silly things meant to be funny on their own. It was a very silly, simple, and (apparently) cheaply made comedy, but one that was enjoyable to watch, nonetheless. I might even recommend it if you are looking for a movie that doesn't require a working brain to understand and find funny.

This movie is a complete waste of time. Jessica Simpson is a terrible actress; she sounds like a little girl throughout the whole movie.For some reason, girls in this movie get-off on men who can swipe groceries fast. (?) Winning employee of the month is like being crowned king in this town. The store throws a huge banquet every time there is an employee of the month election... As most of you probably know, Zack (Dane Cook) only tries to win employee of the month to hook up with Amy(Jessica Simpson). In one scene, the most cliché thing happens. Lan(Andy Dick) gets mad because Zack neglects his friends and focuses mainly on winning employee of the month, so Lan says "the only reason you want to win employee of the month is to sleep with Amy!" OOPS!!! who should be standing behind Zack but Amy!! "Is that true? You wanna know if I slept with the last employee of the month at my last job? Yes, I did. He was my boyfriend, and he was a self centered, arrogant ass just like you! You employees of the month are all the same!!!" I covered my eyes in disappointment. However, somehow he does wind up getting her at the end and Vince (Dax Shepard) fails...cliché?The upside for us guys is that there is not one scene where Jessica Simpson's shirt does not show a massive amount of cleavage... ;-) But it's not worth going to see....

I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I laughed at several witty lines, especially one where Zach corrected Vince's grammar, but Vince didn't get it. Even Jessica Simpson didn't bother me because they didn't try to inflate her intelligence; they just made her a rather bland character. The plot isn't original, but watching Vince pretend he was Tom Cruise from Cocktail made me laugh. When I watch this sort of movie I want to laugh and I did just that. Dane Cook was a pleasant surprise too. I had never seen anything with him. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie even though I didn't think that I would.

Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, and language Employee Of The Month is a comedy starring Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson.I saw it a few months ago on the movie network.I don't really remember much about the movie.Its basically about a box-boy who works at a walmart type store.One day a hot clerk comes to work with them and its a rumor that she sleeps with the "Employee Of The Month".So basically the box-boy tries hard to become the employee of the month which angers his enemy, a rival clerk who is always employee of the month.While doing so, he looses his friends and gets to learn more about the new girl he is smitten by.Employee Of The Month has a few laughs but is overall nothing special.

Really enjoyed Employee of the Month, Its laugh out loud funny in places and the writing and direction are solid, don't get me wrong it's not the comedy of decade but deserves more than 5.5 so felt that I have to write a few positive words.Zack is a really likable character, well played by Dane Cook but Vince steals the show, a great comic performance, some great lines and situations, the supporting cast are all interesting and likable and are played well especially Jorge, Vinces sidekick and Glen Gary ( or Glen Ross) the store manager who really hams up the part and what's not to like or look about Jessica Simpson?Well worth and hour and a half of your time.

Keep watching this over and over. Dax Shepard was the real star of this movie.

I was hardly amused when I saw the previews for this movie. It didn't look that good, I'm not that big of a Dane Cook fan (and in no way a Jessica Simpson fan), and I didn't enjoy "Waiting" too much (though I'm not sure how much that relates).

All the acting was spectacular and I was surprised to find that the writing had equal amounts of humor and heart.To come into it thinking it was going to be terrible and coming out thinking it was one of the better movies I've seen in a while, I'd say that's an accomplishment. Though its only my opinion of course, check it out if your curious.

I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie was way better then I expected. Some of the humor is a little subtle for what you might expect. One scene I liked was toward the end when the box boy gang is coming down the main aisle with Zack next to the Andy Dick character who can barely see thru his coke bottle glasses. Dick starts veering off to the side and Zack puts his arm out and pulls him back and they continue on as if realigning someones walk is a normal event. The movie isn't intended to reinvent Shakespeare but some of the harsher reviewers seem to judge it in that light. I thought Jessica Simpson was a good choice for her part. Any lack of acting ability fit the part just fine and works. It was a pleasant and funny movie to watch and never resorted to throwing in four letter words just to do it like so many movies will do.

I went in hoping for something that was like Clerks or Office Space, What I received was unfortunately this piece of crap.Employee of the Month could have been funny or decent, but like most comedies made in the last decade, all of the characters and situations are unbelievably over the top. The characters are all unsympathetic caricatures with no depth and one joke apiece that they tell over and over again. Many of the remaining jokes don't even make any sense. The thing that always makes workplace comedy the funniest is the truth of the situations the characters find themselves in. Instead what was presented is a series of contrived plot points pulled from every teen movie and apparently written by a twelve year old imagining what it would be like to have a job. There was a chuckle or two and Jessica Simpsons breasts gave a stunning cameo as themselves, otherwise this movie is just another poorly written, directed, and acted cliché fest with no heart, truth or humor.

I didnt hate this movie. Actually was

Zack is content with his job as a box boy at the Super Club supermarket, seeing the days through with the minimum of fuss and effort. The fact that cashier Vince is the exact opposite only confirms the daily choice that Zack makes not to care. However when a new employee starts in the very shapely form of Amy, Zack finds a reason to change his ways. Amy has a reputation for finding ambition attractive, so employee of the month and assistant manager nominee Vince is in with the best shot. Zack decides to win the employee of the month competition instead of Vince, getting the kudos and the girl  but at what price? You can see the potential here for great comedy. The story of the title is really just there to create a frame for a workplace comedy that one would hope learns lessons from Office Space and The Office in really getting down to the reality to find the jokes. Sadly it never really does this but the results are not terrible  just basic. The plot is quite obvious but mainly stays out of the way by being a frame for the action. The relationship stuff involving Amy doesn't offer much for the amount of time that it goes on for but mostly it does free up space for the workplace joking. Problem is that it is not as strong as one would have hoped and much of it is at quite a basic level and doesn't have much in the way of inspiration. It still is quite funny at times and it made for a very easy watch but if you are hoping for more than that then the film will disappoint.The cast are solid but not up to the task of lifting it. Both Cook and Shepard are good enough to do the minimum requirements but not good enough to really deliver something special. The support cast pretty much matches this approach by having a "thing" about their characters that allows one gag but not having anything more. The end result is a basic film that never really excels itself in any regard. It does do the basics well enough to make for very easy amusement for the undemanding viewer but nothing more than that.

Although, I am a big Dane Cook fan, I was very disappointed in this movie. A former warehouse store employee during my college years, I was able to relate to the movie a little more than some people. I think it would have been a much better movie with some small story line changes and most of all...if they had another actress...any other actress...playing the role of Amy.

This movie is just a chill, laid back, comedy. No, it's not the funniest movie I've ever seen, but it certainly did have its moments.I found myself really attached to Dane Cook's character, Zack.

He was true to his character, Vince, and played it well.There are some good messages in this movie like: never turn your back on your friends.This is a good movie that I would recommend to a friend and would watch again.

The movie is about competition between two guys for the employee of the month. Plus to sleep with Jessica Simpson.Jessica Simpson is a horrible actress. She looks blank; she does not show any expression at all. She's just in the movie for her cleavage show, but it is not worth it.Dax Shepard is real good and brings up a few laughs with Efren Ramirez. Apart from them, there is not much to laugh. Humor is just so blank. Dane somehow looks lost and frustrated and does not look like a part of the movie.There is not much spend on the movie, expect probably renting a Costco.The story might have been interesting if Dane tried to win the Employee of the month in his own 'box boy' way. And probably losing it narrowly to Dax, after he realizes what are important to him. Also, there is not much scene to show that he is close with his three friends and so it does not make sense when he feels terrible, at their anger. Poor story writing in this part.This movie tried to a feel good movie, but fails miserably. You will feel empty at the end of this movie, but won't regret watching it. (4/10)

I see a lot of people canceling this movie, I mean it's not an Oscar winner, but it's got its silly moments, the boy chases girl plot, except it's in a costco. I used to work in a big box store like that and could relate to certain things - like that one co worker who is a butt-kisser like how Jorge was to Vince, a good group of friends like Zacks too. Good movie to watch before bed honestly.

This movie is a complete waste of time. Jessica Simpson is a terrible actress; she sounds like a little girl throughout the whole movie.For some reason, girls in this movie get-off on men who can swipe groceries fast. (?) Winning employee of the month is like being crowned king in this town. The store throws a huge banquet every time there is an employee of the month election... As most of you probably know, Zack (Dane Cook) only tries to win employee of the month to hook up with Amy(Jessica Simpson). In one scene, the most cliché thing happens. Lan(Andy Dick) gets mad because Zack neglects his friends and focuses mainly on winning employee of the month, so Lan says "the only reason you want to win employee of the month is to sleep with Amy!" OOPS!!! who should be standing behind Zack but Amy!! "Is that true? You wanna know if I slept with the last employee of the month at my last job? Yes, I did. He was my boyfriend, and he was a self centered, arrogant ass just like you! You employees of the month are all the same!!!" I covered my eyes in disappointment. However, somehow he does wind up getting her at the end and Vince (Dax Shepard) fails...cliché?The upside for us guys is that there is not one scene where Jessica Simpson's shirt does not show a massive amount of cleavage... ;-) But it's not worth going to see....

I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I laughed at several witty lines, especially one where Zach corrected Vince's grammar, but Vince didn't get it. Even Jessica Simpson didn't bother me because they didn't try to inflate her intelligence; they just made her a rather bland character. The plot isn't original, but watching Vince pretend he was Tom Cruise from Cocktail made me laugh. When I watch this sort of movie I want to laugh and I did just that. Dane Cook was a pleasant surprise too. I had never seen anything with him. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie even though I didn't think that I would.

Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, and language Employee Of The Month is a comedy starring Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson.I saw it a few months ago on the movie network.I don't really remember much about the movie.Its basically about a box-boy who works at a walmart type store.One day a hot clerk comes to work with them and its a rumor that she sleeps with the "Employee Of The Month".So basically the box-boy tries hard to become the employee of the month which angers his enemy, a rival clerk who is always employee of the month.While doing so, he looses his friends and gets to learn more about the new girl he is smitten by.Employee Of The Month has a few laughs but is overall nothing special.

I saw this movie expecting to see Dane Cook at his finest, but instead got a pathetic shadow of what he once was. Basically, his character in no way reflected Dane's persona and could have been played by any actor. I was extremely disappointed and now have to convince myself that Dane hasn't gone soft, but instead did this movie to make money and bang Jessica Simpson. This way I can remain a fan of his stand-up. The only thing funny about this movie was Andy Dick, the relationship between Dax and Pedro, and Jessica Simpson's horrible acting abilities. Honestly I never let out more then a closed-mouth chuckle throughout the entire film. I beg of you, unless you enjoy paying for crap, don't see this movie.
