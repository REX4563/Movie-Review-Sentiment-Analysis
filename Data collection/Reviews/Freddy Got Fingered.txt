If you are looking for a moronic, low-brow, hilarious movie, "Freddy Got Fingered" is absolutely immaculate. It has enough of a plot to keep you interested but is so absurd that no one could ever take it seriously. "FGF" is completely random, which I really enjoyed, and Tom Green is as spectacular as ever. If you liked "The Tom Green Show" that aired on MTV during the late 90's then you will enjoy this film; if not then you will find this motion picture completely asinine and abhorrent. There is lots of gross-out humor that is not for the faint of heart and the ending is absolutely priceless. I recommend that everyone spend a Saturday night with a six-pack of cheap beer and "Freddy Got Fingered," you will never forget it.

I genuinely believe that if this movie had better dialogue, better acting, and a more grounded script, it could have been one of the most groundbreaking comedies of the decade. While it has a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made, I've seen way worse. At its core, this movie is all about Gordy, an immature man- child who wants to prove to his father that he is a man. This simple and age-old setup is turned upside down and told through the veil of a sadistic anti-comedy. He goes to absurd, even grotesque lengths to prove that he is independent and self-sufficient. Gordy masturbates a horse and an elephant to prove to himself and his father that he has "grasped manhood". As he grabs the horse's penis, he shouts "Look at me, Daddy! I'm a farmer, Daddy" indicating he wants to prove his independence to his father, the farmer symbolizing a hard worker that produces something valuable to society. The fact that he makes the elephant ejaculate all over his father and right after that his father accepts him shows that he has succeeded.If you couldn't tell from that last paragraph, the film is blatantly offensive, and if it offends you or grosses you out, then it has done its job. Its something of a satire on the increasingly gratuitous and stupid R-rated sex comedies and dumb teen comedies of the 90s. Some of the random celebrity cameos are just there to bring the movie some credibility, just like the movies its making fun of, but also seem to be poking fun at them (like Shaq's cameo). The sheer ridiculousness of everything that happens is itself pretty entertaining and funny. Some people find this movie absolutely hilarious, and I'll admit I'm one of those people.Don't get me wrong, this movie is FAR from a masterpiece. The acting is mostly pretty bad, the story drags at points, and all the dialogue sounds like it was written my Tom Green himself. If the movie was more realistic, Gordy would have been fired twice and arrested at least three times. There are a lot of jokes in the movie that Tom Green has admitted are just inside jokes between him and his friends. That's great for you and your friends, but the general movie going audience won't get half your references. In my humble opinion, this movie had a lot of potential, and in some ways Tom Green may be some kind of comedic genius, but the film's sloppy execution holds it back from being anything more than a fun novelty movie for me to troll my unsuspecting friends with on movie night.

Comedy is perhaps the most subjective of all forms of entertainment. Judy Carter, in her wonderfully insightful "Stand-Up Comedy: The Book", summed it up best: "Some people will laugh at a guy slipping on a banana peel. Some people will only laugh at Hitler slipping on a banana peel." What kills with one crowd will die with the next, and no two people will laugh at the same thing for the same reason. Comedy, in many ways, says more about the laughers than the comedians themselves, and it is no wonder that comedy shop talk is filled with violent images ("If I don't bomb, I'm gonna murder that audience"). Comedy, to put it mildly, is DANGEROUS."Freddy Got Fingered", Tom Green's scabrous black comedy, illustrates this principle to a T. Since his earliest days on Canadian cable-access television, Green has based his career on pushing the envelope. Like Andy Kaufman, his bizarre stunts (many involving animal carcasses and the sexual humiliation of his parents) are primarily about the reaction of both their hapless victims and US, the audience; if you don't step back and consider how you're taking this humor, and why, you're not really getting the whole Green experience. "Freddy" carries this sensibility into a fictional format, giving us the strange tale of a man who lives his life as an experiment in riling people up.Gord Brody (Green) is a young aspiring cartoonist who fails miserably in his attempt to break into the Hollywood big time. He is forced to move back home with his parents, setting off a titanic battle of wills with his stentorian oaf of a father (Rip Torn), an escalating conflict that involves accusations of child molestation, sausages on strings, elephant penises, horse penises, Green's penis, and really badly made cheese sandwiches.Of course, all of this story nonsense is just that: nonsense. It serves no function but to provide Green and co-writer Derek Harvie with a framework for grotesque, deliberately shocking set pieces, many of which work surprisingly well. There's a brief sojourn at a stud farm, where Gord lives out an apparently lifelong fantasy, wagging a horse's genitals while yelling "I'm a farmer!" like a drunken barbarian. In another scene, Gord delivers a baby, ripping the bloody umbilical cord with his teeth. He picks up a wheelchair-bound girlfriend (Marisa Coughlin) who gets her jollies by being caned in the legs with a bamboo stick. And there's the wonderful little boy who spends the whole movie getting accidentally brutalized, hit by cars and running into airplane propellers, always with much blood and flying viscera.Now I know this may not sound that funny, and indeed, "Freddy" has gotten the most dastardly reviews that I think I have ever seen for a major release. Critics don't just hate "Freddy"; they seem personally hurt by the film, as if Green had made the picture just to upset them and get their goat. What they don't seem willing to acknowledge is that Green made the film for EXACTLY that reason, and is getting exactly the reaction he wants. Therefore, his film can be regarded as something of a great success.Personally, I agree with many of the critics who have described "Freddy" as surrealist. There is no attempt to integrate this action into anything resembling the real world. Gord is not a human being, but rather a collection of characteristics. Green plays him as a bizarrely aggressive man-child, a mishmash of helplessly repeated words and phrases, slack-jawed willful stupidity, and screaming, utterly pointless hysterics. Frankly, I admire this approach to the characterization. After seeing so many recent comedies ruined by the filmmakers' need to make their characters both laughable and likeable (most recently with the stultifying "Joe Dirt"), it is refreshing to see Green so willing to come off as annoying, hateful, cruel, UNLIKEABLE. This lack of relatability allows us to laugh at him without feeling like we're also laughing at ourselves.I am not making the claim, as some on this page have, that "Freddy Got Fingered" is any kind of masterpiece. Green's direction is not the equal of his acting bravery. The film suffers from too many muddy visuals, and many moments just lie there on the screen, wriggling when they should fly. Still, the film does what it is supposed to. Half the time you're laughing, the other half just staring at the screen in goggle-eyed shock. You may hate "Freddy", you may love it, but either way, you have to admit that you've never seen anything like it before.

Let me start out by saying that I like Tom Green, that's why I saw this movie.  I also thought he did a great job in his supporting role in Road Trip.  Which left me wondering what to expect from a movie in which he wrote and starred in.  Well, after having seen it, I was profoundly disappointed in this film.  While the movie did have a few hilarious scenes (dad telling Gord to make him proud, Gord driving off yelling at the lady to get the f*** out of his way) it was more or less a waste of time.  Other than a few funny moments, I found myself constantly checking my watch, wondering how long the revolting, pointless, and mindless film would last. After watching this movie, I truely believe that Tom Green should stick to his improv street antics.     1 of 10

I am the kind of person that always watch movies not in a snobbish way. I always try to find the good in a movie, I know that cinema isn't only Fellini or Bergman, sometimes you need that, but sometimes you just want to have fun with a trash b-movie (I love horrors, but even some stupid comedy can do). Then I find this movie, it looks like the demential comedy that has plenty of invention and think can be ok. It lasts almost 2 hours and I only laughed once! (the scene of the false navel). Beside that I couldn't find the movie funny. Maybe it's telling us something about finding a job and I am so happy a got one, cause on the contrary this movie for sure would have furtherly depressed me! I'll show it to some friends of mine to test their IQ. The one who laughs more won't be my friend again.

Oh my God, was this movie bad.  Is it supposed to be a comedy?  Nobody laughed in the theater I was in.  The National Post gave this minus one star, and that's bang on. Tom Green, you are disgusting.

Freddy Got Fingered is brilliant. I've enjoyed it since seeing it on video cassette around when it left the theater. It wasn't a movie I wanted to see because I didn't care for Tom Green at all. I thought his type of comedy was lame, just pranking but in an offensive way.
This movie is NOT about him pranking. In fact, it's a fairly well-thought out, well-shot movie. The dialogue is absurd, but quote-worthy. That's if you enjoy the film. It's garnered a love-hate relationship with movie audiences since it came out.
I'm disappointed it hasn't gotten the cult status the movie like The Room has gotten. The Room was just plain bad, terrible acting, directing, etc... Freddy Got Fingered on the other hand, was sharp, witty, and yes, offensive, but in a movie way.
Why does Freddy Got Fingered really work. Think of it as Tom Green's f-u to Hollywood. Not that he hated Hollywood, at least I don't think he did. But he did EXPLOIT its excesses in the movie. I mean, the giant explosion alone is an example of this, probably blowing a huge budget on that scene, which I highly doubt was in the original script the way it turned out.
He's not only exploiting Hollywood on the budget, but also on what is considered offensive. How did he get away with all the stuff he did? I'm surprised it made it through with an R rating. Tom really pushed the boundaries of decency all for comedy, but looking back at it now, it's almost like he foresaw the way things would go in real life. I mean, everything today is about hyperbole and over reaction, or instant gratification.
I also look at the movie as a parallel to Tom Green's life, and how he got the money to make the movie. If you're easily offended, then of course you will hate this movie. The casting was also perfect. Harlan Williams as the best friend, Rip Torn as angry dad, Marisa Coughlan as the girlfriend (she had to say and do some crazy things). The title character 'Freddy' doesn't appear much in the movie and isn't really a huge part of the film, because it's all about watching Gord's journey. But he was still important but he never really takes front and center in the film.
I have watched this movie more than a dozen times, and I expect to watch it many more!

If your a fan of Tom Green, this is a must see. This movie was a favorite the 1st time I viewed it nearly 20 years ago. Very odd and just plain bizarre..but thats expected of him. Rip torn was great in this as well as Paul finch..Backwards man I can walk backwards fast as you can...timeless comedy..Tom Green is one of a kind.

I absolutely recommend everyone to avoid this movie, unless you love humour with really bad taste. I watched this one at my friend's house, and he actually thought it was fun, but also agreed that some of the parts were REALLY, bad.I was lucky, seeing this one at my friend's house, so at least I didn't have to pay for it. When about 10 minutes of the film had passed, I was like: "Seriously, I don't wanna watch this, change movie!" I thought to myself; "Who write's this kind of sh*t??!?!!" And of course, after taking a look at the DVD cover I saw that it was, Tom Green himself, who directed, starred and wrote the thing. JUST,an AWFUL MOVIE!

I understand that this is a terrible movie but it's also incredibly hilarious and so quotable. I usually avoid these types of films until someone forces me to watch them - but Tom Green is an absolute genius. The sausages, honestly. The psychologist's office. The cheese sandwiches. The horse. I've laughed so hard at moments in this movie. Much more than I've cringed at the parts that fell flat. Please don't think you're too good to laugh at Tom Green until you have given him a go. He isn't for everyone but he might surprise you.

Complete and utter tripe. I like stupid physical humour as much as the next guy, but this was just pure crap. Rehashes of old Tom Green skits, no where plot, terrible direction. I'm surprised my eyes didn't bleed, at least I didn't have to pay to see it (Hurrah for VCD)... And the compulsory "An hour or so of my life which I can never get back".

Sigh. I can't believe I saw that movie. It is, of course, the worst I've ever seen. Humor, by its nature, works using circumstance and relationship to cause laughter. While these are not necessary for humor to be present, they are quite helpful. If this movie had a coherent plot, and tied together some of the scenes, the gross-out jokes could actually be quite funny, because we as an audience would develop a relationship with the characters, and their persistent humiliation onscreen would mean more to us.As it is, we care about no one in the movie. The penises and blood and death, shocking and in some ways funny though they are, don't really mean much. The majority of the movie I spent groaning through stupid scenes that I didn't understand, most of which didn't even have shock appeal. The movie is just bad. It's not that you can't make a disgusting and funny movie with this material. It's just that they didn't.

Freddy Got Fingered is amazing.  Amazing, in the fact that it is probably the worst movie I have ever scene.  I can enjoy the Tom Green Show from time to time, but this movie provided me none of the enjoyment of the show.
The plot of the movie is non-existant, allbeit that the film belongs to a genre where a lack of plot is sometimes acceptable, typically when coupled with humor.  The humor in Freddy Got Fingered is however, as non-existant as the plot.It doesn't surprise me that Tom Green's movie is as bad as it is, but shame on Harlan Williams, Drew Berrymore, Anthony Michael Hall, and other actor that's produced an enjoyable film for participating in it.To sum it up...  This movie was soooo bad that it prompted me to post my first comment here on IMDB.

It isn't humanly possible to eat that much in an entire lifespan, as I had the feeling to throw up again after I had watched that movie. Films like 'Barbed Wire' and 'Anaconda' Are actually great virtuosity to soul and body compared to this film. I can't think of one thing, not a single one, that could make me watch that movie again, I'd rather be overrun by a heard of milk producing hoove animals!! If Tom Green ever gets another part in a movie I'll be surprised indeed... I loved him in 'Road Trip' for example, but his performance in 'Freddy Got Fingered' was mildly said despicable. I feel truly sorry for those people who has edited 'Freddy Got Fingered' their misery and agony must have been horrible and unbearable, at least mine was over after I had watched it one time, they had to watch the same scene again and again.

Yup. I seen a lot of movies but this one is one of the worst (maybe THE worst) I ever seen. Lame Jokes.... (and I'm a "campus comedies" fan so imagine how lame are the jokes!!) Avoid this movie or you'll be depressed for a week.

Freddy Got Fingered is an opus of insanity that would make Bluto from Animal House dry heave.  It is a film where the boundaries are not only broken through (like before with other gross out comedies), but done with a cheese helmet and a sausage organ.The film stars Tom Green as a guy who wants to become a cartoonist, but is constantly put down by his father, played in one of the best villain roles in a decade by Rip Torn.  While Torn goes crazy here, it is Green here who takes the cake (much like he did in Road Trip), by bringing on a barrage that had me after the movie was over awe.Not in awe though like I have after seeing GoodFellas or Apocalypse Now, but in awe of what people can do.  I was amazed at the scenes (I don't even know if they'll get in here) in which he dances in moose skin, gives hand filled pleasure (so to speak) to a horse and then tops itself (in one movie which always is a amazement) by getting off a elephant and spraying Torn in the process, and also licks the wound of a broken leg.  Now, if this had been done wrong, like a flop known as Tomcats, it wouldn't work well.  But Green brings on a good timing for his insanity (he directed and co-wrote) and makes it watchable and actually hilarious, if only for myself and the people watching with me.But that is not to say this film is for everyone; I'm sure there will be people like the Ebert type who will want to blow chunks at the sight of the visuals that Green gives.  But if you think you can take it, or just want a disgusting laugh, this film is reccomended.  One of the funniest movies of the year, and oddly enough might become a classic.  A-

The title sez all. Watch this movie and u will regret it for whole ur life because I do. Should have fill my time with more good film other than this. Avoid it at all cost. This guy tryin so hard to make ppl laugh at his not-funny-lame-stupid-joke. Friggin movie!

I recently found this on DVD for $10 and I'm glad I did.  I'd already seen it once before, but subsequent viewings proved to me the genius that this movie is.  Nothing is certain in this movie and its humour is beyond compare.  The thin plot is a perfect vehicle for Tom Green's style.  Random event after random event flies by and it gets funnier all the time.  The plot line that eventually explains the title is ridiculous and hilarious.  I highly recommend this movie.  I don't feel like getting redundant, so I'll just say this: One of the funniest movies ever, perfect for viewing again and again, especially early in the morning.  Favourite scenes: the baby being born and the cheese sandwich factory.

Gord is an animator. He moves to Hollywood to sell his ideas and lands a job in a cheese sandwich factory. When he is knocked back by Dave Davidson, saying Gord's animations suck, Gord breaks down, quits his job and moves back home; much to his fathers distaste. Gord later meets Betty, who is wheelchair bound. She is trying to make a rocket wheelchair.Mixed with the simple story, we are "treated" to constant sick and depraved acts that make up this movie. Everything in this movie is wrong, there isn't anything PC about it. Tom Green just didn't push through the boundaries of good taste, he torn them down and ripped them apart. On first viewing you are just stuck in a state of shock from what your seeing. This is real disgusting; and its just bloody hilarious. I laughed so much in this movie. This has some of the sickest stuff i've seen, but cause it takes it too far, its doesn't have any level of seriousness. There is no internal logic either. We just skip from one retarded act to the next, but there isn't a lot of internal logic when it comes to anything you watch of Tom Green.This does have its audience, and i'm there with them. An ultimate act in bad taste.

If you are looking for a moronic, low-brow, hilarious movie, "Freddy Got Fingered" is absolutely immaculate. It has enough of a plot to keep you interested but is so absurd that no one could ever take it seriously. "FGF" is completely random, which I really enjoyed, and Tom Green is as spectacular as ever.

This movie is pretty funny, but you need a very peculiar sense of humor to appreciate it. If you're like me and burst out laughing at the idea of wild animalistic clowns making honking noises with their red noses to signal their attack, Freddy Got Fingered will make you laugh so hard green goo will spurt from your nipples!

Comedy is perhaps the most subjective of all forms of entertainment. Judy Carter, in her wonderfully insightful "Stand-Up Comedy: The Book", summed it up best: "Some people will laugh at a guy slipping on a banana peel.

Delightful drama with subtle comedy makes this film very classy

I understand that this is a terrible movie but it's also incredibly hilarious and so quotable. I usually avoid these types of films until someone forces me to watch them - but Tom Green is an absolute genius. The sausages, honestly. The psychologist's office. The cheese sandwiches. The horse. I've laughed so hard at moments in this movie. Much more than I've cringed at the parts that fell flat. Please don't think you're too good to laugh at Tom Green until you have given him a go. He isn't for everyone but he might surprise you.

Complete and utter tripe. I like stupid physical humour as much as the next guy, but this was just pure crap. Rehashes of old Tom Green skits, no where plot, terrible direction. I'm surprised my eyes didn't bleed, at least I didn't have to pay to see it (Hurrah for VCD)... And the compulsory "An hour or so of my life which I can never get back".

Sigh. I can't believe I saw that movie. It is, of course, the worst I've ever seen. Humor, by its nature, works using circumstance and relationship to cause laughter. While these are not necessary for humor to be present, they are quite helpful. If this movie had a coherent plot, and tied together some of the scenes, the gross-out jokes could actually be quite funny, because we as an audience would develop a relationship with the characters, and their persistent humiliation onscreen would mean more to us.As it is, we care about no one in the movie. The penises and blood and death, shocking and in some ways funny though they are, don't really mean much. The majority of the movie I spent groaning through stupid scenes that I didn't understand, most of which didn't even have shock appeal. The movie is just bad. It's not that you can't make a disgusting and funny movie with this material. It's just that they didn't.

I think FREDDY GOT FINGERED is a stupid movie. It is so far this year, the worst movie. I think it will not even bother to get any Oscar or Golden Globe, instead it is my least favorite movie.Tom Green is a stupid comedian and my parents will not let me mention him. Ever.It is not the Mona Lisa of all movies. This is easily the worst comedy ever.GRADE: F

It isn't humanly possible to eat that much in an entire lifespan, as I had the feeling to throw up again after I had watched that movie. Films like 'Barbed Wire' and 'Anaconda' Are actually great virtuosity to soul and body compared to this film. I can't think of one thing, not a single one, that could make me watch that movie again, I'd rather be overrun by a heard of milk producing hoove animals!! If Tom Green ever gets another part in a movie I'll be surprised indeed... I loved him in 'Road Trip' for example, but his performance in 'Freddy Got Fingered' was mildly said despicable. I feel truly sorry for those people who has edited 'Freddy Got Fingered' their misery and agony must have been horrible and unbearable, at least mine was over after I had watched it one time, they had to watch the same scene again and again.

Freddy Got Fingered is amazing.  Amazing, in the fact that it is probably the worst movie I have ever scene.  I can enjoy the Tom Green Show from time to time, but this movie provided me none of the enjoyment of the show.
The plot of the movie is non-existant, allbeit that the film belongs to a genre where a lack of plot is sometimes acceptable, typically when coupled with humor.  The humor in Freddy Got Fingered is however, as non-existant as the plot.It doesn't surprise me that Tom Green's movie is as bad as it is, but shame on Harlan Williams, Drew Berrymore, Anthony Michael Hall, and other actor that's produced an enjoyable film for participating in it.To sum it up...  This movie was soooo bad that it prompted me to post my first comment here on IMDB.

Yup. I seen a lot of movies but this one is one of the worst (maybe THE worst) I ever seen. Lame Jokes.... (and I'm a "campus comedies" fan so imagine how lame are the jokes!!) Avoid this movie or you'll be depressed for a week.

Freddy Got Fingered is an opus of insanity that would make Bluto from Animal House dry heave.  It is a film where the boundaries are not only broken through (like before with other gross out comedies), but done with a cheese helmet and a sausage organ.The film stars Tom Green as a guy who wants to become a cartoonist, but is constantly put down by his father, played in one of the best villain roles in a decade by Rip Torn.  While Torn goes crazy here, it is Green here who takes the cake (much like he did in Road Trip), by bringing on a barrage that had me after the movie was over awe.Not in awe though like I have after seeing GoodFellas or Apocalypse Now, but in awe of what people can do.  I was amazed at the scenes (I don't even know if they'll get in here) in which he dances in moose skin, gives hand filled pleasure (so to speak) to a horse and then tops itself (in one movie which always is a amazement) by getting off a elephant and spraying Torn in the process, and also licks the wound of a broken leg.  Now, if this had been done wrong, like a flop known as Tomcats, it wouldn't work well.  But Green brings on a good timing for his insanity (he directed and co-wrote) and makes it watchable and actually hilarious, if only for myself and the people watching with me.But that is not to say this film is for everyone; I'm sure there will be people like the Ebert type who will want to blow chunks at the sight of the visuals that Green gives.  But if you think you can take it, or just want a disgusting laugh, this film is reccomended.  One of the funniest movies of the year, and oddly enough might become a classic.  A-

first of all I can understand how someone could love this movie but I can also understand how someone could totally hate it. This movie and especially its humor is really a matter of taste more than anything else.I wouldn't dare to call this movie a good one. In fact it's far from it. Most of the moments in the movie make absolutely no sense and there is almost absolutely no story present. Most of the humor is also very vulgar and just totally over-the-top gross and visual. But yet this movie also really made me laugh. So how could I, when being completely fair and unbiased, possible call this movie a bad one?I think that this movie is so bad that it becomes good. The jokes in the movie really aren't that strong but because they are delivered so incredibly over-the-top and stupid, it becomes truly an hilarious movie at times. Yes, so basically the movie is so stupid that it becomes a good one.The story is just totally weird and stupid and lacks some consistency. All of the events occurring in the movie don't really always feel connected. The comical situations are far from believable and they almost have nothing to do with the main story. In fact most of the time they are completely tasteless. Some, if not most people will probably not be able to handle this not so subtle sense of humor (also hence the low rating here). No it absolutely is not the most subtle and consistent comedy ever made.Tom Green is totally over-the-top and crazy. He is not always funny but his character makes the crazy story somehow work. Rip Torn also shows his comical talent and he perhaps plays the best part of the movie. All of the other characters are somewhat muddled in to the crazy story.A comedy that doesn't make any sense but because of that becomes quite hilarious to watch at times. Clearly not a movie for everyone's taste obviously though.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

The title sez all. Watch this movie and u will regret it for whole ur life because I do. Should have fill my time with more good film other than this. Avoid it at all cost. This guy tryin so hard to make ppl laugh at his not-funny-lame-stupid-joke. Friggin movie!

I recently found this on DVD for $10 and I'm glad I did.  I'd already seen it once before, but subsequent viewings proved to me the genius that this movie is.  Nothing is certain in this movie and its humour is beyond compare.  The thin plot is a perfect vehicle for Tom Green's style.  Random event after random event flies by and it gets funnier all the time.  The plot line that eventually explains the title is ridiculous and hilarious.  I highly recommend this movie.  I don't feel like getting redundant, so I'll just say this: One of the funniest movies ever, perfect for viewing again and again, especially early in the morning.  Favourite scenes: the baby being born and the cheese sandwich factory.

Gord is an animator. He moves to Hollywood to sell his ideas and lands a job in a cheese sandwich factory. When he is knocked back by Dave Davidson, saying Gord's animations suck, Gord breaks down, quits his job and moves back home; much to his fathers distaste. Gord later meets Betty, who is wheelchair bound. She is trying to make a rocket wheelchair.Mixed with the simple story, we are "treated" to constant sick and depraved acts that make up this movie. Everything in this movie is wrong, there isn't anything PC about it. Tom Green just didn't push through the boundaries of good taste, he torn them down and ripped them apart. On first viewing you are just stuck in a state of shock from what your seeing. This is real disgusting; and its just bloody hilarious. I laughed so much in this movie. This has some of the sickest stuff i've seen, but cause it takes it too far, its doesn't have any level of seriousness. There is no internal logic either. We just skip from one retarded act to the next, but there isn't a lot of internal logic when it comes to anything you watch of Tom Green.This does have its audience, and i'm there with them. An ultimate act in bad taste.

If you think, "I'm not going to turn off this movie, it just has to get better!!"..... It doesn't. Just turn it off, the sooner the better.  Better yet, don't even allow your friends to be subjected to it.  This movie is so bad, the powers that be should pull the copies off the shelves to protect the innocent.  I forgive Rip Torn.  We all should be allowed to make mistakes.
