Here's the deal: Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE has panned Mr. Bean's Holiday for being unfunny, a cow milked dry, same old same old, blah blah blah. Either these people just don't have a sense of humour, if I may be that harsh, or they didn't even see the flick and just reviewed it based on the weak trailer and their own false assumptions. I on the other hand have seen this movie and I can honestly say that it blew me away. It is not only about ten times better than its weak 1997 predecessor (which the film wisely ignores completely), it is a genuinely great movie. It's a feel-good movie which actually makes you feel good (!!) and never turns into awkward sappiness. It is also absolutely hilarious and, thank god, unlike the original movie this one doesn't recycle gags from the TV series.The basic story is that Mr. Bean wins a ticket to Cannes, where he accidentally separates a young boy from his father. Bean must help the kid find his father again. The plot is hardly the focus of the film, though - it's all about Bean and the often awkward, often painful, and always funny situations he gets himself into.Rowan Atkinson is at his absolute best and I think it's about time he gets an Academy Award. No, I'm serious. If you think playing Mr. Bean is just a matter of goofing around and making stupid noises, I'd like to see you do it. Atkinson has developed this character to absolute perfection and is the only one who could possibly play the lovable idiot. The over-the-top body language, the facial expressions, and the convincing vibe you get from Bean that, well, the lights are on but there's nobody home - you can't bring all of this to a character if you're not a good actor. Rowan Atkinson is a genius and, like most comedians, he never gets the recognition he deserves.The supporting cast is good as well, especially Willem Dafoe as an art-house director with his head so far up his own ass and an ego so ridiculously huge he makes Roger Ebert look like Adam Sandler. But this is really Atkinson's show and he carries the entire movie, as expected. The sight gags and physical humour aren't exactly intellectual, but they are very funny and fresh most of the time and the comedy is, well, kind of classy. There's absolutely no toilet/gross-out humour (which I love, by the way), so it's really a mystery why the stuck-up critics disliked this as much as they did - assuming they even watched it. Although the humour is pretty "safe" most of the time, it never stops being funny and I can safely say that this is a film that the whole family can enjoy (and trust me, I don't often say that about movies - "fun for the whole family" usually translates to "fun for the average two-year old, torture for the rest of humanity" in my mind). It's not just kiddie stuff and the comedy is universal.It's a sweet, warm-hearted and very funny movie with a great soundtrack, good performances, a light plot, and a fantastic ending. Which leads me to the question: "Did I and the critics watch the same movie?" Perhaps Willem Dafoe's obnoxiously pretentious character hit just a little close to home for the snotty critics the film so obviously spoofed? They can have their "Playback"-type films and gush praise over them all they want - I'd take this holiday over that any day.

I don't know what it is about this obviously ridiculous film, but this is one of the few films that makes me laugh consistently throughout. It's hilarious, exciting, and it features one of the Rowan Atkinson's finest performances. One of my favorite comedies that I've seen.

If this truly is Mr Beans last adventure then I think we can only salute Rowan Atkinson and the writing team as the iconic character truly goes out with a bang.Stripping back all the Americanisms that were clear for all to see in the first film Mr Beans Holiday goes back to basics by having a simple story that allows the character and Atkinsons talents to be on full show. With the beautiful French backdrop this is a fast moving film that has a lot of heart and humour. Dafoes cameo isn't great but it doesn't matter because Atkinsons bumbling Bean more than makes up for it with some great comedic moments throughout.So long Bean, it's been a blast.

When this film began, I noticed a major problem at the beginning--and a problem that often plagues TV shows that are brought to the big screen. Instead of using the original writers who made the show so amazing, all-new writers were responsible for this film. Why idiots in charge of film companies do things like this is beyond me. So, from the outset, I was unimpressed and a bit baffled. I would have MUCH preferred to just see the simple sort of skits done the way they were so expertly done on the show--and the same problem existed with the first Bean film. No new locations, no guest stars to take away from the glory that is Bean and the same old writers that made it one of the best comedies in TV history.The film finds Mr. Bean winning a raffle which gave him a trip to Cannes. Along the way there, he naturally gets into various problems and leaves a wake of destruction. Ultimately, his weird ways result in a man missing his train--and his young son is stuck on the train to Cannes alone. Bean, in an unusual display of conscience (something he generally seems devoid of in the past), he decides to help the kid--though it took his missing a train to get him to do this. What makes this a little tougher is that the kid only speaks Russian.In many ways, this plot is rather reminiscent of the "Mind the Baby Mr. Bean" TV episode--though it throws in some pathos and schmaltz involving worried parents wondering about what has happened to their missing kid. Pathos is really something rather un-Bean like. Normally, the consequences of Bean's actions on others is rarely shown for more than a second or two--as people are usually more like objects in the show.Overall, it IS a decent film despite my being terribly disappointed in it. For people who never raw the original show, they'll probably like it a lot more than crazed folks like me who own DVDs of the original shows and think they are the greatest things on the planet! The main problem are that there's just too much plot in the film and the writing and pacing are wrong--making it enjoyable but a shadow of the original. On the plus side, the scenery in the film is nice and it does make you want to visit the French countryside. And, while it had almost nothing to do with Bean, I really liked the self-absorbed director's film (Willem Defoe) BEFORE Bean got a hold of it--it was a wonderful commentary on some film makers and it makes you wonder who they might have been parodying.

Well, overall I'd say that I enjoyed this movie and got enough laughs out of it to make it worthwhile, but I wouldn't watch it again. I think you can only take so much of Rowan Atkinson's "Mr. Bean." A newcomer to him (believe-it-or-not), I found him a lot of fun in the first half of the film but, boy, this guy is tough to take in longer dosages. I wonder if others feel that way?It's weird; the film was entertaining.....but I found myself looking at my watch a lot during the last 20 minutes, hoping it would end. Maybe breaking the film into two viewings would have helped. Atkinson's goofy faces are very funny at first but get tiresome after an hour.Well, it was a "cute" story, anyway, and certainly one the whole family could watch. There is nothing, language or sex-wise, that would offend anyone. This is just old-fashioned, almost silent-film-type slapstick comedy. "Mr. Bean" certainly is a likable guy, as are the co- stars, Emma De Caunes and young ------ . Actually I probably laughed more at the ultra- corny lines delivered by Willem Dafoe, whose character pokes fun at film makers. How Dafoe uttered some of these lines with a straight face is beyond me!The film, though, belongs to Atkinson who is in about every scene and hams it up to the max. If you laugh at his contorted facial expressions and limber body (check out his karaoke work!), you'll love the film. It's very lighthearted comedy and I wouldn't knock the innocence of it, but it's difficult to take in one dose.Overall: recommended because this is one of the few comedies of recent times you can actually watch with your kids and not worry about anything offensive. For that, it deserves some accolades.

I enjoyed a lot this movie...it made me lo-ugh for the first time in a long time...Rowan Atkinson does a wonderful performance playing Mr. Bean...The story of the movie is simple:Mr. Bean wins a trip to France...But in reaching France he passes through a lot of adventured, partly of his lack of knowledge of the language...I liked the idea of the movie, the lack of dialogs, made me like more this movie and especially enojy Mr. Bean's gags...Another thing that i liked is the fact that this film is fille with very interesting scenes,very funny and original...The "tie scene" and "doing everything not to fall asleep scene" are in my opinion very original...I awnt to add that the movie also had some sad parts, but this made me appreciate all the more this movie...I gave it a 7 cause it really impressed and changed my day.

My husband and I took our two boys (ages 6 and 9) to this movie. We are avid Bean fans and have the DVD set that spans Atkinson's career as Mr. Bean. Is Mr. Bean's Holiday the greatest comedy ever? Probably not. However, as a parent I find it very difficult to take my boys to movies and this was one of the few times where I actually felt we were at a family picture. When was the last time a movie was rated G? My boys had a wonderful time watching the site gags, and they followed along with the subtitles, which I thought was good for them. My husband and I had a fun time and unlike many children's movies, there was no sarcastic attitude, which I find is so prevalent in films right now. Some people have cited that they felt Mr. Bean's relationship to a child in the movie was inappropriate, but I did not get that vibe from the film. Also, Atkinson has used children in his Bean skits for years, always with funny results. I think people may read too much into it. Remember, Bean is pretty much a boy himself. While I think an adult who has no familiarity with Bean may find it all rather ridiculous, this is good family fare that parents can feel comfortable with. As I tell my boys, sometimes it is just fun to be silly.

If you asked a handful of people of varying ages in America, chances are you'd get about 8 out of 10 knowing who he is. They may not know Rowan's real name, but they know the character.The sad part about this film is that it's absolutely wonderful, and most people in America aren't going to see it because it's rated "PG". Not a dirty gag, foul word, or joke about someone's junk to be found. And the really amazing part is that it's half comedy, half gorgeous scenery surrounding it. It mocks the Hollywood standard, it has melodious music, it's masterfully filmed, and all the while you just find yourself going "Oh, that Bean." *puts fists on hips*I can't honestly say I've seen a film this good, this funny, this... pure that can make anyone laugh and find themselves feeling charmed after having seen it. Emma De Caunes stole my heart, Max Baldry is a kid that anyone his age can relate to, and Defoe actually pulls out a great, over-the-top performance without even uttering a four-letter word that he's so very good at snarling out.You know what? Shame on us America. That we need the big bang, the flatulence, and the double entendre to amuse our soured idea of comedy. What is so wrong with having a character like Bean, a performance like Atkinson's, that we can't find that part of us that wasn't soured on tasteless "humor" but just absorb and let out a barrel-chested sigh of satisfaction after a hearty laugh from a genuine, clever clean joke or visual gag?We'll go on, with our Jackasses and Scary Movie XII and we'll forget about them five minutes after we've left the theater, but darnit, it's high time a movie like Mr. Bean's Holiday came along. And I for one would pay money to see this again, even if the American know-it-alls of Hollywood think it's better suited in a death slot in September, to be forgotten, sandwiched between sequel after sequel and the banality of teen slasher flicks acted by twenty-somethings whose genre should have died off years ago.If what Atkinson says is true, that this is the last time Bean will ever appear, then he's gone out on the highest note you could ever bestow on a character so beloved. Shine on Bean, and ride off into that sunset, you crazy, wonderful fella you. And thanks for all the laughs.... But where's Teddy?

Well, my wife and I are fans of Mr Bean and Rowan Atkinson. We rounded off a nice weekend by going to have a laugh at Mr Beans expense. Well, we did just that. A laugh. In fact there might have been 3. Even the kids who were watching it with their parents only managed about 3 laughs. I warn you all, this is the most dire film you could ever go and see. The storyline was predictable, and even though that's the whole point of Mr Bean, it was even more so than usual...so much so that it just wasn't even funny.The French actress was the only thing that kept me going. She was beautiful and actually a good actress. Willem Defoe, who is usually extremely good, was only average.got to say if I'd got this out on DVD it would have been turned off after 10 minutes and returned. Don't waste your breathe.Very sorry Mr Atkinson. I think you are a comedy genius but this did not hit the mark...and a cinema full of people where I was would say the same, kids and adults alike.Miss it, you won't be missing out.

Mr. Bean is back and he's going to France on a holiday adventure. It's great to see Rowan Atkinson back on the big screen after a long time. I think the last time I saw him on screen was in 'Love Actually' (not so-great film but Atkinson was awesome). And of course, he's playing the character he immortalized, the goofy Mr. Bean. There are several Beanish slapstick moments set throughout the dazzling spectacular French locations. Beam also befriends a young Russian, Stepan and a French actress, Sabine. Together they share his adventures.Though the comedy itself doesn't rely on witty dialogues, there's plenty of fresh slapstick and silly moments that made me laugh. Of course, I enjoy Mr. Bean's sketches too so there is a chance that those who don't like him, might not enjoy the film. I found the characters quite lovable. Emma de Caunes as Sabine is charming and pretty and child actor Max Baldry as Stepan is impressive (unlike those annoying movie kids who 'beg' the audience to love them when getting on their nerve). But 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' clearly belongs to Atkinson. He's a wonderful comedian and it's great to seem him back as Mr. Bean.Cinematography and visuals do a great job by portraying the stunning locations of France. Yes, because of that the film is visually impressive too. The editing seems good enough but I found the ending to be slightly choppy.Having said all that, 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' is much better than it's prequel. This one feels fresh and...well my summary pretty much says it all. A fun family film, especially if you like the Mr. Bean Sketches.

If you liked the TV series and the first Bean movie, you will most definitely enjoy this one. The plot, in a nutshell, is that Mr Bean wins a raffle, and his prize is a trip to Cannes in the south of France. But disaster ensues, and he ends up getting lost. All he wants to do is go to the beach, but he gets caught up in other people's problems - including a lost child.The acting is superb. Mr Bean stays in character, and is still funny - it doesn't grow old. All the other characters do a good job too. They speak several different languages so there's plenty of variety here. The storyline is wonderful too - and it doesn't shove too much detail into your face. Unlike the previous Bean movie, it is closer to the series because the plot is simpler. It is simple yet enjoyable. The comedy varies from simple chuckles to hysterical laughter, and there should be something for everyone.So, for my closing comment, it is simple enough for kids to understand, but enough plot and laughs to keep adults amused. There's something for everyone here.

I was looking forward to seeing this movie the day it had come out because I think Rowan Atkinson is a comedic genius (especially with that face). I saw it at a birthday party, so that would be fun. I thought the movie was silly really. But it was really hilarious. It lost some marks though because the humor was really childish, seriously. And the events that happen are extremely unlikely. The part where the bus ticket fell into a Chicken Pen just got me. But I still laughed at that part. And Carson Clay's movie called Playback was stupid. That movie wouldn't even go on the big screen because it made everybody fall asleep. I am still getting the movie on DVD just for fun entertainment.

Throughout the time line of iconic comedy characters, few have had a successful transition from television to cinema, or vice versa, or even braved the journey. Rowan Atkinson goes to right the wrong of his first Mr Bean film, with a holiday in France.Upon winning a vacation trip to France, courtesy of a raffle, Mr Bean (Rowan Atkinson), along with a camcorder, traverse by train though France, in hope of reaching the Riveria. After some difficulty with the French language, and oddball mistakes, Mr Bean meets up with 8 year old Stepan, who has had a mishap of his own and is looking for his father. Two becomes three when they meet up with an amateur film actress, Sabine, and they decide to head to the Cannes Film Festival.The story of Mr Bean's Holiday is expectedly simple and lighthearted. While a continuing journey, the story is effectively made up of situational skits. Thankfully these skits do bring their share of laughs, but there are problematic dead spots scattered between. Since the story is simple and not set for deep characterisation, these moments are off putting and only time wasters. Another aspect of the film is the sentimental overtones, which are extremely apparent in the final scene of the film. While obviously in running with the holiday theme and family orientation, this sentimentality is rather unbecoming of a Mr Bean title, and worst yet, his trusty teddy is not even brought along for the ride.And without teddy brings another slight problem with Mr Bean's Holiday. The humour is indeed very good, and similar to the television series for the most part, but there are various moments where you can feel the Mr Bean magic could have worked better. Luckily for all the inconsistent dead spots, and accompanying laughs, the film does reach a hilarious climax.Mr Bean returns with his usual antics, but there is nothing that will stop the entire family going to watch the film.Mr Bean's holiday never reaches it potential, but there are some shining moments worthy of the original television series. While wholesome clean fun, the sentimental flavour of the story only goes to numb its overall performance.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---

This second movie follows the error of the first as Bean stays abroad and faraway of his British soil! I don't understand the reason to cut his roots except for greedy international box office! Here as the producer is french so Bean goes to France! His vision my country is fair (whereas the maps of his travels aren't): dense, modern Paris and a desert but beautiful countryside outside! This sequel is not as funny as the first but I could giggle all along, which is rather enjoyable! Rowan proves he is a genius in mime and seeing comedy in every place or situation! However the ending with Cannes festival is totally crap (the french producer organizes it with its TV) and really hurts the quality of the movie! Finally, my advice would be to stick with his original TV show!!

Mr. Bean's Holdiay was a movie I really enjoyed. Mr. Bean was back in true form, and delivered an unexpectedly funny movie. Part of Mr. Bean's humor is when something is about to happen, you can see it from a mile away, and you yell at the screen "look out Mr. Bean!" or "He left it on the counter! Oh No!" or what have you. There is plenty of this,but there is also a great deal of irony and clever wordplay in it as well. It's a well rounded comedy movie, that will be funny to children and adults alike. I'm not really a big Mr. Bean fan, but I really liked this movie anyway, and I know that most people will too, if they give it a chance. I will definitely recommend this movie to my friends, and to anyone who reads this review.

I've been a big fan of Mr.Bean and I was kinda disappointed with Dr.Bean or whatever it was called. It was good, but it was kind of boring. I was excited when this movie came out, but I wasn't expecting too much from it.Yet, I came out from the cinemas quite happy. This movie was great. Everything seemed right with this film. It was hilarious right the way through. Of course, there's no concerns about Rowan Atkinson's acting or his hilariously retarded voice. It was great.The story was very captivating and I couldn't stop laughing during parts of the film. People all across the cinema were cracking up, and people seemed very happy with its ending.There are many brilliant scenes and the story moved along rather well. It wasn't too slow paced to me, and there were some hilarious scenes.This movie was hilarious and you should check it out.

Mr Bean again doesn't disappoint. His real life situations are brought to the utmost of extremes once more. He could pick up a penny and be funny. The holiday scenario was a good choice and I had never ending chuckles to laughter throughout the movie. The characters chosen were good and the language barriers a fun extra. As usual Mr Bean tries to help everyone he sees and always puts himself in turmoil whilst doing so. Again he creates as much disaster as he avoids and one wonders why he leaves his house at all. This simplest of journeys turns into a fun ride through laughter, and the actual travel scenery and events make it real (well as real as it could get). So hop on board this fun Mr Bean adventure and laugh and cry though the journey.

Saw the preview today (24 March 2007) in S Wales. I can only hope it's not the final version.I really wanted to laugh, but couldn't. The plot was thinner than a watered down bowl of minestrone soup. The cinema was shrouded with silence when there should have been howls of laughter. They even cut the scene from the trailer where Bean spills his coffee over a laptop whilst on the train (my disappointed 7 year old daughter spotted that). My 3 year old son fell asleep half way through.The only highlights for were the moped-jacking, the market dancing/opera sketch and Antoine de Caunes' daughter.Why did they postpone the US release until September?This will be out on DVD faster than a dodgy oyster can work its way through your digestive system.Unfortunately it follows the old adage - Good trailer, Sh*te film.

Here's the deal: Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE has panned Mr. Bean's Holiday for being unfunny, a cow milked dry, same old same old, blah blah blah. Either these people just don't have a sense of humour, if I may be that harsh, or they didn't even see the flick and just reviewed it based on the weak trailer and their own false assumptions. I on the other hand have seen this movie and I can honestly say that it blew me away. It is not only about ten times better than its weak 1997 predecessor (which the film wisely ignores completely), it is a genuinely great movie. It's a feel-good movie which actually makes you feel good (!!) and never turns into awkward sappiness. It is also absolutely hilarious and, thank god, unlike the original movie this one doesn't recycle gags from the TV series.The basic story is that Mr. Bean wins a ticket to Cannes, where he accidentally separates a young boy from his father. Bean must help the kid find his father again. The plot is hardly the focus of the film, though - it's all about Bean and the often awkward, often painful, and always funny situations he gets himself into.Rowan Atkinson is at his absolute best and I think it's about time he gets an Academy Award. No, I'm serious. If you think playing Mr. Bean is just a matter of goofing around and making stupid noises, I'd like to see you do it.

Perhaps Willem Dafoe's obnoxiously pretentious character hit just a little close to home for the snotty critics the film so obviously spoofed? They can have their "Playback"-type films and gush praise over them all they want - I'd take this holiday over that any day.

After too long on our screens Mr. Bean returns but not in his usual way. Instead of crazy laughs per minute (as in Bean and the earlier Mr. Bean TV episodes), this is a road trip movie with some gaps in the action. There are laughs but some of the scenes are more clever than hysterical. Nothing however can take away from the joy of sharing in Mr. Bean's exploits as he tries to reach his simple goal, a holiday at the beach. Everyone left the film with huge smiles and several had tears of happiness (not tears of uncontrollable laughter). If you want to see a happiness inducing pick me up movie then this is one of the best around.

Last week i took the girlfriend to see '300', this week it was her turn to pick the film... her choice... Mr Beans Holiday. I wasn't too impressed with this but fair is fair! I couldn't remember much of the first film but wasn't expecting to be blown away or enjoy it to be frank! However i was pleasantly surprised and am not ashamed to admit i enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong, this is no classic but it is a enjoyable film. The first thing i liked was the fact it wasn't set in America, so i didn't have to listen to a number of Americans try to explain who this Mr Bean character was! I didn't laugh out loud, but I did chuckle along at the jokes and enjoyed some of the darker aspects such as the mobile phone gags! When i saw Karel Roden pop up early on in the film i chuckled to myself as he filmed the camcorder... thinking back to the film '15 minutes' (if you've seen it you'll understand what i mean) This helped me loosen up and allowed me to enjoy the film. Also loved the whole Carson Clay in love with himself film moment near the end.I loved Black Adder, but was only a Mr Bean fan when i was very young, as an adult i have to say i'd grown out of it! This however made me reminisce and remember how good a comedian Rowan Atkinson is! The director also deserves credit too, as he keeps this story nicely edited through-out and lets the adventure unfold at a nice pace. Mr Beans love interest also deserves credit for being very easy on the eye! I won't go on about this film much, but basically don't just cross it off as something you'll hate. This is a loving, nice, and light-hearted affair, though strange in places it fits itself as a film that is good enough to sit through and enjoy. So if it's a rainy day sit back, relax and watch! A basic film comedy for all the family!

I don't know what it is about this obviously ridiculous film, but this is one of the few films that makes me laugh consistently throughout. It's hilarious, exciting, and it features one of the Rowan Atkinson's finest performances. One of my favorite comedies that I've seen.

It's very lighthearted comedy and I wouldn't knock the innocence of it, but it's difficult to take in one dose.Overall: recommended because this is one of the few comedies of recent times you can actually watch with your kids and not worry about anything offensive. For that, it deserves some accolades.

That's a excellent film, I really loved it! Again Rowan Atkinson give us his classical character Mr. Bean. From beginning to end it is a very sweet and warm hearted film! It is a great film for kids and adults! I only hope that Rowan will revisit this character again! We need more Mr. Beam! The acting is perfect a way above many comedians! Clearly we can notice the inspiration from "Mr. Hulot's Holiday (USA)"All the supporting actors are very good, it is just a very well cast film with great soundtrack! Also Willem Dafoe is great as the obnoxious pretentious art-film director So please Rowan don't do the same that the main character do in Sullivan's Travels (1941). WE NEED MR. BEAN!!!

My husband and I took our two boys (ages 6 and 9) to this movie. We are avid Bean fans and have the DVD set that spans Atkinson's career as Mr. Bean. Is Mr. Bean's Holiday the greatest comedy ever? Probably not. However, as a parent I find it very difficult to take my boys to movies and this was one of the few times where I actually felt we were at a family picture. When was the last time a movie was rated G? My boys had a wonderful time watching the site gags, and they followed along with the subtitles, which I thought was good for them. My husband and I had a fun time and unlike many children's movies, there was no sarcastic attitude, which I find is so prevalent in films right now. Some people have cited that they felt Mr. Bean's relationship to a child in the movie was inappropriate, but I did not get that vibe from the film. Also, Atkinson has used children in his Bean skits for years, always with funny results. I think people may read too much into it. Remember, Bean is pretty much a boy himself. While I think an adult who has no familiarity with Bean may find it all rather ridiculous, this is good family fare that parents can feel comfortable with. As I tell my boys, sometimes it is just fun to be silly.

I don't get it, I loved the Mr Bean series (all 3 seasons) and the Bean movie, but this movie just has NOTHING funny in it. I literally didn't crack a smile from start to finish, nor did anyone else in the room. Whatever the other Bean episodes and movie had, this one hasn't got it. You'll take it back to the video store thinking "I should have picked that other movie I was going to instead". Truly a very sad end to the Bean franchise. Even in the original series, Bean could talk, although he didn't do so fairly often, but in this movie he seems to have been reduced to the status of retarded mute. The humor lay originally in the fact that he wasn't an idiot but saw things in a different way to the rest of us, but in Bean's Holiday, he appears to be a runaway from a sheltered workshop. It could have been oh, so, so, so good (particularly because the French, after all, provide plenty of ammunition to make fun of them with) but it completely missed the mark. I suspect Rowan Atkinson did it for the money only, write the script in an evening, and didn't do any research. It could have been filmed anywhere, with any characters, and the plot wouldn't have changed much. Pathetic, sad and very disappointed.

If you asked a handful of people of varying ages in America, chances are you'd get about 8 out of 10 knowing who he is. They may not know Rowan's real name, but they know the character.The sad part about this film is that it's absolutely wonderful, and most people in America aren't going to see it because it's rated "PG". Not a dirty gag, foul word, or joke about someone's junk to be found. And the really amazing part is that it's half comedy, half gorgeous scenery surrounding it. It mocks the Hollywood standard, it has melodious music, it's masterfully filmed, and all the while you just find yourself going "Oh, that Bean." *puts fists on hips*I can't honestly say I've seen a film this good, this funny, this... pure that can make anyone laugh and find themselves feeling charmed after having seen it. Emma De Caunes stole my heart, Max Baldry is a kid that anyone his age can relate to, and Defoe actually pulls out a great, over-the-top performance without even uttering a four-letter word that he's so very good at snarling out.You know what? Shame on us America. That we need the big bang, the flatulence, and the double entendre to amuse our soured idea of comedy. What is so wrong with having a character like Bean, a performance like Atkinson's, that we can't find that part of us that wasn't soured on tasteless "humor" but just absorb and let out a barrel-chested sigh of satisfaction after a hearty laugh from a genuine, clever clean joke or visual gag?We'll go on, with our Jackasses and Scary Movie XII and we'll forget about them five minutes after we've left the theater, but darnit, it's high time a movie like Mr. Bean's Holiday came along. And I for one would pay money to see this again, even if the American know-it-alls of Hollywood think it's better suited in a death slot in September, to be forgotten, sandwiched between sequel after sequel and the banality of teen slasher flicks acted by twenty-somethings whose genre should have died off years ago.If what Atkinson says is true, that this is the last time Bean will ever appear, then he's gone out on the highest note you could ever bestow on a character so beloved. Shine on Bean, and ride off into that sunset, you crazy, wonderful fella you. And thanks for all the laughs.... But where's Teddy?

Thanks to a church raffle Mr Bean wins a holiday to the South of France, as he wants to go Cannes. He must negociate Eurostar, Paris cabs, while not losing his passport or the camcorder with which he is documenting his fabulous journey. Bean only uses three words of French : non, oui and gracias. Along the way he has encounters with a lost Russian boy : Baldry , an aspiring actress : Emma de Caunes, and an egomaniac filmmaker : William Defoe, all en route to the Cannes Film Festival.It is a fun set-up with plenty of room of hilarious set pieces, including ridiculous situations, continuous jokes and absurd humor. The laughs and jokes have a variable strike rate and there are times when you feel that everyone's just treading water before the next big set piece. Still Rowan Atkinson proves is on peak form, showing a great skill on the hilarous public spectacle he plays to save some money to take the bus or train. The theme about a strange man in a strange land is quite fun, too. Rowan Atkinson is well accompanied by a good support cast such as : Emma de Caunes as the sympathetic newcomer actress, the veteran Jean Rochefort, Karel Roden, the little boy Max Baldry and special mention for William Defoe in a likeable role as a maniac and proud director.Mr Bean Tv series enjoyed worldwide syndication. Being the first : short Mr Bean Bus stop 1991, following Mr Bean series 90-95. A film : Bean 1997 by Mel Smith with Rowan Atkinson, Peter MacNicol, Pamela Reed, Harris Yulin . Mr Bean's wedding, Mr Bean : Funeral short. Mr Bean, the animated series formed by 105 episodes, Hundy Bean and TV shorts 2018-2020. Furthermore, a similar character as a butcher spy in 3 films : Johnny English, Johnny reborn and Jonny English strikes again. In addition, Rowan Atkinson has played serious role as Inspector Maigret in TV movies as : Maigret ln Montmartre, Maigret's night at the crossroads, Maigret's dead man, Maigret sets a trap.This Bean's Holiday contains a lively and catching musical score by Howard Goodall. As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Irvine, being completely shot in France. This amusing motion picture produced by Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner was well directed by Steve Bendelack.

Well, my wife and I are fans of Mr Bean and Rowan Atkinson. We rounded off a nice weekend by going to have a laugh at Mr Beans expense. Well, we did just that. A laugh. In fact there might have been 3. Even the kids who were watching it with their parents only managed about 3 laughs. I warn you all, this is the most dire film you could ever go and see. The storyline was predictable, and even though that's the whole point of Mr Bean, it was even more so than usual...so much so that it just wasn't even funny.The French actress was the only thing that kept me going. She was beautiful and actually a good actress. Willem Defoe, who is usually extremely good, was only average.got to say if I'd got this out on DVD it would have been turned off after 10 minutes and returned. Don't waste your breathe.Very sorry Mr Atkinson. I think you are a comedy genius but this did not hit the mark...and a cinema full of people where I was would say the same, kids and adults alike.Miss it, you won't be missing out.

Mr. Bean is back and he's going to France on a holiday adventure. It's great to see Rowan Atkinson back on the big screen after a long time. I think the last time I saw him on screen was in 'Love Actually' (not so-great film but Atkinson was awesome). And of course, he's playing the character he immortalized, the goofy Mr. Bean. There are several Beanish slapstick moments set throughout the dazzling spectacular French locations. Beam also befriends a young Russian, Stepan and a French actress, Sabine. Together they share his adventures.Though the comedy itself doesn't rely on witty dialogues, there's plenty of fresh slapstick and silly moments that made me laugh. Of course, I enjoy Mr. Bean's sketches too so there is a chance that those who don't like him, might not enjoy the film. I found the characters quite lovable. Emma de Caunes as Sabine is charming and pretty and child actor Max Baldry as Stepan is impressive (unlike those annoying movie kids who 'beg' the audience to love them when getting on their nerve). But 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' clearly belongs to Atkinson. He's a wonderful comedian and it's great to seem him back as Mr. Bean.Cinematography and visuals do a great job by portraying the stunning locations of France. Yes, because of that the film is visually impressive too. The editing seems good enough but I found the ending to be slightly choppy.Having said all that, 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' is much better than it's prequel. This one feels fresh and...well my summary pretty much says it all. A fun family film, especially if you like the Mr. Bean Sketches.

If you liked the TV series and the first Bean movie, you will most definitely enjoy this one. The plot, in a nutshell, is that Mr Bean wins a raffle, and his prize is a trip to Cannes in the south of France. But disaster ensues, and he ends up getting lost. All he wants to do is go to the beach, but he gets caught up in other people's problems - including a lost child.The acting is superb. Mr Bean stays in character, and is still funny - it doesn't grow old. All the other characters do a good job too. They speak several different languages so there's plenty of variety here. The storyline is wonderful too - and it doesn't shove too much detail into your face. Unlike the previous Bean movie, it is closer to the series because the plot is simpler. It is simple yet enjoyable. The comedy varies from simple chuckles to hysterical laughter, and there should be something for everyone.So, for my closing comment, it is simple enough for kids to understand, but enough plot and laughs to keep adults amused. There's something for everyone here.

I was looking forward to seeing this movie the day it had come out because I think Rowan Atkinson is a comedic genius (especially with that face). I saw it at a birthday party, so that would be fun. I thought the movie was silly really. But it was really hilarious. It lost some marks though because the humor was really childish, seriously. And the events that happen are extremely unlikely. The part where the bus ticket fell into a Chicken Pen just got me. But I still laughed at that part. And Carson Clay's movie called Playback was stupid. That movie wouldn't even go on the big screen because it made everybody fall asleep. I am still getting the movie on DVD just for fun entertainment.

Throughout the time line of iconic comedy characters, few have had a successful transition from television to cinema, or vice versa, or even braved the journey. Rowan Atkinson goes to right the wrong of his first Mr Bean film, with a holiday in France.Upon winning a vacation trip to France, courtesy of a raffle, Mr Bean (Rowan Atkinson), along with a camcorder, traverse by train though France, in hope of reaching the Riveria. After some difficulty with the French language, and oddball mistakes, Mr Bean meets up with 8 year old Stepan, who has had a mishap of his own and is looking for his father. Two becomes three when they meet up with an amateur film actress, Sabine, and they decide to head to the Cannes Film Festival.The story of Mr Bean's Holiday is expectedly simple and lighthearted. While a continuing journey, the story is effectively made up of situational skits. Thankfully these skits do bring their share of laughs, but there are problematic dead spots scattered between. Since the story is simple and not set for deep characterisation, these moments are off putting and only time wasters. Another aspect of the film is the sentimental overtones, which are extremely apparent in the final scene of the film. While obviously in running with the holiday theme and family orientation, this sentimentality is rather unbecoming of a Mr Bean title, and worst yet, his trusty teddy is not even brought along for the ride.And without teddy brings another slight problem with Mr Bean's Holiday. The humour is indeed very good, and similar to the television series for the most part, but there are various moments where you can feel the Mr Bean magic could have worked better. Luckily for all the inconsistent dead spots, and accompanying laughs, the film does reach a hilarious climax.Mr Bean returns with his usual antics, but there is nothing that will stop the entire family going to watch the film.Mr Bean's holiday never reaches it potential, but there are some shining moments worthy of the original television series. While wholesome clean fun, the sentimental flavour of the story only goes to numb its overall performance.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---

Mr Bean again doesn't disappoint. His real life situations are brought to the utmost of extremes once more. He could pick up a penny and be funny. The holiday scenario was a good choice and I had never ending chuckles to laughter throughout the movie. The characters chosen were good and the language barriers a fun extra. As usual Mr Bean tries to help everyone he sees and always puts himself in turmoil whilst doing so. Again he creates as much disaster as he avoids and one wonders why he leaves his house at all. This simplest of journeys turns into a fun ride through laughter, and the actual travel scenery and events make it real (well as real as it could get). So hop on board this fun Mr Bean adventure and laugh and cry though the journey.

Mr. Bean's Holdiay was a movie I really enjoyed. Mr. Bean was back in true form, and delivered an unexpectedly funny movie. Part of Mr. Bean's humor is when something is about to happen, you can see it from a mile away, and you yell at the screen "look out Mr. Bean!" or "He left it on the counter! Oh No!" or what have you. There is plenty of this,but there is also a great deal of irony and clever wordplay in it as well. It's a well rounded comedy movie, that will be funny to children and adults alike. I'm not really a big Mr. Bean fan, but I really liked this movie anyway, and I know that most people will too, if they give it a chance. I will definitely recommend this movie to my friends, and to anyone who reads this review.

This second movie follows the error of the first as Bean stays abroad and faraway of his British soil! I don't understand the reason to cut his roots except for greedy international box office! Here as the producer is french so Bean goes to France! His vision my country is fair (whereas the maps of his travels aren't): dense, modern Paris and a desert but beautiful countryside outside! This sequel is not as funny as the first but I could giggle all along, which is rather enjoyable! Rowan proves he is a genius in mime and seeing comedy in every place or situation! However the ending with Cannes festival is totally crap (the french producer organizes it with its TV) and really hurts the quality of the movie! Finally, my advice would be to stick with his original TV show!!

First of all i want to say that as a mister Bean fan i enjoyed the TV series very much. The first Bean movie wasn't bad but i really hoped for more and was exited about the second movie until i saw it. I can't say that the movie was awful, but one thing is for sure - thats not English humor and thats not mister bean. For my opinion its just another average comedy, perhaps more suitable for children, not much laughs, just another average movie, I really expected much more from Rowan Atkinson. If u r looking for a movie to see with your kids u might like it, but if you expect to see mister bean from the TV show don't bother to watch it cause u won't find him there.

This hasn't quite been the great year for movies that I had hoped for, but it has certainly been a very good year for comedies, and "Mr. Bean's Vacation" is the best so far. It is also quite a daring film -- who would have imagined a G-rated, live action comedy these days, and without any fart jokes? Where's Mel Brooks when we need him? Just kidding. This movie homage, and I can it can be argued that it is, to the great Tati films of "Mon Oncle" and "Mr. Hulot's Holiday" is Rowan Atkinson's triumphant farewell to the great character he created. It is hard to imagine any other actor living today pulling this off. Indeed, "Vacation" comes very close to being a silent film -- though I want to assure anyone wandering in from a showing of Transformers, that there are explosion. Now over at the well-known movie review site, half the critics are complaining about Mr. Bean's mugging. Half the critics at that site will apparently complain about anything. But when you have a face as brilliantly expressive as Atkinson's, gosh people, you use it. To moan about that, well, it's like going to a Fred Astaire movie and complaining about the dancing.But more than that, every scene works, fast or slow, the pacing is perfect. Silly scenes or heartfelt, or both, the comedy never flags. It is one of those movies that long afterward you will be recalling scenes and laughing. The casting is perfect. William Defoe? Yes! There is also a lot of feeling here. I completely bought every one of the characters and their relationships. That is great comic writing.It also has one of the best endings of any movies out there. For some reason, contemporary films are having a terribly difficult time with coming up with a satisfactory ending. Not "Mr. Bean's Vacation." It has an astonishingly goofy conclusion, one that Mel Brooks at the top of his form would have had a hard time equaling.I cannot recommend this movie enough, though I wish it had been longer. Take your family to see it -- it will be a long time before anyone can say that again about a contemporary comedy.

I've been a big fan of Mr.Bean and I was kinda disappointed with Dr.Bean or whatever it was called. It was good, but it was kind of boring. I was excited when this movie came out, but I wasn't expecting too much from it.Yet, I came out from the cinemas quite happy. This movie was great. Everything seemed right with this film. It was hilarious right the way through. Of course, there's no concerns about Rowan Atkinson's acting or his hilariously retarded voice. It was great.The story was very captivating and I couldn't stop laughing during parts of the film. People all across the cinema were cracking up, and people seemed very happy with its ending.There are many brilliant scenes and the story moved along rather well. It wasn't too slow paced to me, and there were some hilarious scenes.This movie was hilarious and you should check it out.

Saw the preview today (24 March 2007) in S Wales. I can only hope it's not the final version.I really wanted to laugh, but couldn't. The plot was thinner than a watered down bowl of minestrone soup. The cinema was shrouded with silence when there should have been howls of laughter. They even cut the scene from the trailer where Bean spills his coffee over a laptop whilst on the train (my disappointed 7 year old daughter spotted that). My 3 year old son fell asleep half way through.The only highlights for were the moped-jacking, the market dancing/opera sketch and Antoine de Caunes' daughter.Why did they postpone the US release until September?This will be out on DVD faster than a dodgy oyster can work its way through your digestive system.Unfortunately it follows the old adage - Good trailer, Sh*te film.
