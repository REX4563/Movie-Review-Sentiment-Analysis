Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of George Romero's previous films, especially the dead series. I thought he really hit his stride with Day of the Dead making a slick, structurally sophisticated continuation of his original idea. Not many people can pull off a sequel and I thought he did it twice with Dawn and Day. I also think he had something quite interesting to say with each of those films, layering thematic commentary under the story without distracting from main story elements or themes. His films were always about the shortcomings of man and the inability to work together in the face of danger. His films were always about the people, not the zombies.But now he has tried so hard to make a political statement that he has hammered into his own genre at the expense of the film. It was interesting in Day when the scientist discovers that a zombie can regain some latent memory and begin to function in a more human way. I was very powerful when that zombie musters up just enough motor skill and latent memory to shoot the villain. It feels like a stretch to say that the zombies, or even the one zombie, in Land could make a conversion of understanding that leads an all out revolt. On an intellectual level, I understand it, but it just didn't work for me. This seems to me like a bigger deviation from the Romero concept then some of the things complained about in the many Romero inspired films recently.The world described in the previews and press material doesn't seem fully realized. There is a huge divide between the rich and the poor. Why? How did it get that way. It doesn't seem like that would function well under the circumstances of the world as it is, especially in a small society. Why don't we find out anything about how this place works? How does Denis Hopper maintain his power? It is presented as a concept without any real thought. In the original film "The Island of Lost Souls" Doctor Moreau controls his population of beasts with fear. He cracks the whip, recites the law, and talks about the house of pain, which the audience knows to be the doctor's laboratory, but the beasts know it as a building where screams are heard. This is a stunningly well designed political metaphor. In Land of the Dead, I couldn't help thinking that the underlying political message was driving the story and that questionable things were written into the story for the wrong reasons. Money is a major plot device. Denis Hopper tries to escape the city with two large bags of money. What good is money outside the city? I was wondering, what good is money inside the city? Money only works if people believe in the underlying value of it. Most countries in the real world can't keep a stable currency. There is an aerial shot of the city during the day showing the streets deserted. Why are the streets deserted? Where are all the people? Later we see the same shot only the streets are now filled with Zombies. The characters keep talking about going to Canada as a safe haven. Why? Why is Canada safer than the United States. I was left to believe that this was more political commentary. Why are the Zombies trying to get to the city? They seem to be driven by some underlying, dare I say it, political motivation.The film as a whole seemed less like a story of characters in a horrific world established in the earlier films, and more like a series of one dimensional vignettes based on thin political ideology  Rich verses poor, violence in America, mismanagement of government in post 9-11 society, negotiating with terrorists, yeah we get it. Not so subtle.

Simon Baker leads in this film as a mercenary who wants to head up North. Maybe the undead do not like the cold. He find himself trapped between various warring factions, including a ruthless CEO (Dennis Hopper) who offers safety to the wealthy while allowing the unwashed masses to fend for themselves, a fellow mercenary (John Leguizamo) who will sacrifice anyone to advance his own agenda, and hordes of zombies who are starting to take steps up the evolutionary ladder. They actually used a gun in this film. First time I've seen a zombie do more than eat. They even went in the water. Apes don't do that! Lots of blood, but there was less action than I've seen and more talking.I love John Leguizamo, and that made it worth my time. Seeing Asia Argento (xXx) wasn't bad either.

The undead have taken over the world. What traces of humanity remain have taken to backing themselves into protected cities and getting supplies by venturing out in heavily armoured groups to raid smaller towns. One such city is formerly Pittsburgh, where the rivers provide natural protection and those who organised themselves into leaders have created a world of near normality while the rest live in the streets with less material and more risk. One of the raiders (Riley) is sure that he has seen evidence of learning among the undead but events within the city itself cause him more concern as his former second-in-command decides to take violent revenge for being betrayed by city boss Kaufman.How you receive this film is more about you than the film itself (which I suppose is true of most things in a way  everything has a market somewhere). Those that will love it will be those looking for gore as their horror because the film delivers this in spades. The camera lingers on flesh eating, mutilation and some very painful sequences that had me looking away. However the problem for me was that it was just gore  not horror, not scares and not anything that made me feel uncomfortable in my own house. A minor criticism perhaps but let me assure you that me and zombie movies do not mix well and not only do I get scared during the films but also for days afterwards by the idea of it all.Surprisingly then I was able to watch Land of the Dead with a detached air and it never convinced me of the world I was being shown. Part of this is budget but that's not all of it as I never bought the characters or main story either. The story in particular narked me because it did dominate the main horror (the mass of undead) and spent too much time on the detail of the human interactions and betrayal. In itself this is not a killer and indeed recently I saw The Mist do a very good job of making human monsters just as scary as the rubber ones but here Romero doesn't make as much of his social commentary as he could have done  OK so we have the haves and have-nots but beyond that we don't get much in the way of intelligence.The cast reflect the low budget but are good enough for the level that this is working on. Baker is a bit bland but OK, while Leguizamo at least adds a bit of energy to his character. Hopper takes on a fairly easy role of just being a "Mr Big" character that even done in P Diddy/Daddy music videos in the past. Argento is sexy but little else while Joy is pretty good in his support character. Clark is better than a zombie character will get him credit for and makes his stuff quiet interesting and engaging. In regards getting the best "urgh" impact from his gore budget, Romero does well but I was surprised that he didn't do more as a writer or as director to do better with the characters or the tension/danger within the story; like I said, I was surprised by how much of an observer this film allowed me to be.Worth a look for gore fans and those seeking out some old school zombies in the middle of these modern "28 Days Later" type ones but really this film is a bit of a disappointment in just how average it is. The gore is great but it produces repulsion, not scares and Romero cannot create a sense of genuine horror or fear as he tries to deal with a narrative that takes more than it gives.

I love horror movies. I love zombie horror including Dawn of the Dead. Night of the Living Dead was okay. Dawn of the Dead was so good because it introduced us to true zombie horror and gore and there has since been no comparisons. It's difficult to scare us now with cheap zombie gags. It's boring. Land of the Dead lacks true creativity. It should have been made over 10 years ago then maybe it would be more than just average. This movie is AN OUTDATED IDEA. It lacks today's suspense and horror. Sure it is a social commentary but this is Hollywood not a political rally. Romero used dated ideas with dated gags. We've seen more than zombies devour human flesh. In fact, the gore scenes should have been used to help with the scares. One thing that this movie lacked was character. When we watch good horror movies we can't help but jump when Jaime Lee Curtis jumps in Halloween. I don't remember any of the characters names or any particular character scene that stood out. Spoiler: The smart zombie should have had his moment in the end only. Instead he's rallying the troops throughout the movie...bad, bad, story because now he's no longer scary or intimidating. Spoiler: Whats with the line of zombie at the pier. Zombies don't get in a soldier style formation when only 1 of them can somewhat think. Spoiler: Too much smart zombies make no scary zombies. Spoiler: Why would Dennis Hopper depend on band of misfits to do work including run most important offensive/defensive weapon (truck) rather than the well trained, paramilitary dressed, soldiers. Spoiler: The movie would have been more entertaining with the misfits trying to save a sighed city than showing the ruin-the-zombie picnic scene in the end. Romero did stick to his slow moving zombie tradition. I personally think he should have stepped it up. If they can get smarter, then they can get faster. This would have elevated the suspense and chases dramatically. I believe Romero should have used a scare to surprise us with zombie developments rather than waste movie time to explain the story. OVERALL i rate it a 6 because i seen a lot worst and i can understand Romero's attempts, yet and still isn't this suppose to be a horror movie?

A great Zombie movie written and directed by the Zombie master himself George A Romero who created the Night of the living Dead film series which is mostly known for the second entry in the series Dawn of the Dead which is one of the greatest Zombie movies ever made.This entry in the series takes place almost two decades after the Zombie outbreak where Zombies now cover the earth and whats left of the humans now live in a secure city lead by the super rich while the poor scavenge for food and supplies and man the defences of the city the scavenging crews are lead by Riley Denbo (Simon Baker) who wants out of the city while his friend Cholo Demora (John Leguizamo) wants into the tower where the super rich live but after a midnight raid on a small town filled with zombies goes badly they end up leading a horde of zombies right to the city's gate now they have bigger problems to deal with as the dead start working together to get there meal.The blood and gore looks great and has much more detailed scenes of zombies eating people than most movies are willing to show especially in the Directors cut of the movie which is more graphic.The makeup and green screen effects are pretty good for there time a little obvious now but in 2005 were passable also great acting all round the characters likable and unique.I recommend this movie to any fan of zombie movies especially ones with plenty of blood and gore and a decent budget to make it look better than B movie zombie movies.

Zombies have taken over the world in Land of the Dead, the remaining survivors live within a walled city to keep the dead out. A revolution is brewing in a plan to overthrow the city. but outside the walls the zombies are developing their intelligence.The plot kind of sounds a bit lame, but it really does work well and this is a zombie flick that can be taken quite seriously. Romero has again created something great on a tight budget, and he has done well to make it look good, with some great make up effects. The cast are all pretty good, there are some good characters and the dialogue is effective.Overall Land of the Dead delivers all out zombie action that's great for fans of the genre, good work George.8/10

Now I know that this will anger some of the rave reviewers, but I am speaking honestly, and not bashing.First off, I am an avid Romero fan, having seen every 'Of the Dead' movie from the black and white original NIGHT, Dawn, and Day, the remade 'Night' and the remade 'Dawn'. I love zombie movies for the disturbing factors involved with trying to survive through the crisis.I'm talking about having to kill loved ones that turned, shooting neighbors, and old friends that you might come across,...shooting little children zombies (which I might add, there were NONE that I can remember seeing in this film...I might be mistaken). The thought of the dead returning to life and feeding off the living is a fear (although irrational) that a lot of people couldn't deal with.Now for the review: I will try to hold the spoilers to a minimum, because they are aggravating, I know. First, I like the idea of zombies learning to rationalize and communicate. It picks up where DAY left off,..I'll give GAR that much. As far as the lead zombie..I agree w/ a previous comment that they overused him. I didn't like the fact that only 1 was able to start thinking, instead of all of them at the same time. He remained a leader, and showed sorrow and anger when his fellow dead-ites were killed or injured. I don't like zombies w/ emotion. It doesn't work for me.I went into the theater KNOWING that this was going to be more of an action film than a horror film...anything with as much firepower as dead reckoning and tons of machine guns is self proclaiming. I was praying it wouldn't be Resident Evil 3. It wasn't a complete waste, seeing as how I got the ticket for free,...but the element of fear and horror from the other movies from GAR's series just wasn't prevalent enough for me. I'm glad it is doing so well...so hopefully GAR might get an inkling to make something else...but as far as this one goes, it just wasn't for me. I think HORROR when I go see a zombie movie. I went into this one...saw some good gore, and had a couple of chuckles, but I didn't go home with that good IL' zombie feeling that I get when I watch NOTLD or DOTD at night by myself in a dark room with the sound cranked.Go see the movie for yourself, you won't be angry when you leave,...you might be happy.I'm just a weird person with a weird ass perspective. Or maybe everyone else is a mindless zombie that is distracted by big noises and funny one-liners and bright lights (for those who have seen it, I'm referring to SKYFLOWERS) and doesn't know what a zombie movie is supposed to be.Just for the record...the scene where dead reckoning goes up to the gates of whatever that fancy hotel was and sees a big mass of zombies tearing up all the rich people, and you hear screaming and bloodletting.....that was the best part of the movie for me.

I have to say that Land of the Dead was a disappointment. The main strength of the other ...of the Dead -films was that they were very much believable. The characters felt like real people and the settings were realistic, as much as you can say that about a zombie movie. More to the point, those were serious movies.Land of the Dead on the other hand was silly. Soo, we have this cavalcade of blandly beautiful b-actors who have silly nicknames, the society is divided to haves and have-nots, the latter of which have a dirty face. The main character is so goddamn noble and righteous that he could have been ripped out of an American war movie. For some reason money is relevant and on the top of the food chain there is one guy, who in the end tries to make an escape with big bags of money. Haven't I seen this in a dozen bad 80's scifi and post holocaust films? Bland characters, silly setting, big plot holes, worn-out clichés, but also several good moments and jokes. Compared to other b-grade post-holocaust and zombie flicks, Land of the Dead was mediocre. Compared to Romero's other films, it was outright bad.

Nobody wanted this film to be good more than I. Last year when the script was posted online I read it in one sitting from start to finish. Totally fascinated. I thought it was a brilliant exercise in class warfare, race, the human condition, etc. In other words, more than the mindless Italian zombie movie, and more than anything Romero did before. It contained some of the elements that he retrieved from the original "Day of the Dead" script (that he wasn't able to film back then when his budget was cut by 2/3 or so)...Anyway, so I came to this movie with high expectations based on the phenomenal reviews by both media and the fanboys...maybe I shouldn't have read so much for this has to be the most disappointing movie of the year! First, if you come into this looking for gore, you are going to be disappointed. I believe there is more cannibalism and blood in last year's "Dawn" remake...weird that no one mentions that. But worse than that is the script. I get the feeling Romero had to cut a big bit down (what else is new, George?) from the script I read online because most of the character development was completely gone. Only "Cholo" (nice name) had any kind of motivation and even that could have been explained a lot better. Sure, he represents the working class that wants to move up in society but they could have done more with it...the scene where he gets blown off by Hopper looks like it was rushed. There was zero subtlety...not that well done. Simon Baker's character fared worse. We get the feeling that he and the Robert Joy guy had a bit of a history working together --that's it for his back story. A bit about his dead sister, nothing more. Sorry, it's hard to care about characters we don't know anything about. Contrast this with the scene in the "Dawn" remake where you actually had people sitting around talking about their stories, where they came from, etc. Like night and day, no pun intended.As for the "Fiddler's Green" refuge for the rich-- I was looking forward to seeing something out of Ballard's "High Rise" the way it was described in the press but Romero hardly even showed it or explained anything about it. Who were the people who lived there? How did Hopper decide who gets to live there and who stays in the city streets? where did the city people live? Could we see their housing situation? Too many questions, not enough answers. If a point was trying to be made about classism -- and it could have been a damn good one -- it sure wasn't made in this movie.

Rating: * 1/2 out of **** Land of the Dead has been long-awaited for a good two decades. Set presumably some time after Day of the Dead, the plot focuses on a human population that has managed to survive by barricading themselves within the "remains" of Pittsburgh by means of guards and electrified fences (as well as rivers that are bordering the city). The rich reside in a tower called Fiddler's Green but everyone else is forced to live in the streets, with only the false hope of being able to attain high-class status.One guy dissatisfied with living in the streets, Cholo (John Leguizamo), doesn't take kindly to the mayor's (Dennis Hopper) refusal, especially having been his lackey for three years with the expectation of reward. So Cholo steals the armored vehicle Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler's Green unless he gets his five million dollars (which is the amount needed to get high-class status, but did he really expect to be welcomed into Fiddler's Green with open arms after this incident?). Refusing to cooperate, the mayor hires Riley (Simon Baker) to bring Dead Reckoning back. Meanwhile, the undead are planning to invade the city thanks to the evolving zombie called Big Daddy, and given this couldn't happen at a worst possible time, you can guess what'll happen next.I'm going to put it bluntly, this film is by far the worst of Romero's zombie movies, lacking in so many ways that I would still feel the same way even if I didn't have its predecessors to compare it with. But there are its predecessors, and having already seen three prior films in which characters must hold off scores of zombies at bay from inside some "safe" location before it's ultimately penetrated by the undead, let's just say seeing this a fourth time gets a little repetitive.The film does have elements worth appreciating, the cinematography is excellent and easily the best of the series; I especially loved the stylish and creepy nighttime shot of zombies shuffling within a fog-shrouded forest. The movie is also the most action-packed of the series, so the non-stop gunfire keeps the movie watchable. The production values are also pretty good considering the budgetary limitations (some of the f/x still look pretty weak, though).Otherwise, LOTD is rushed, unfulfilling, and does little its predecessors haven't already accomplished. What new material it does aim for is poorly conceived, a shocker considering Romero's had twenty years to mull over this material. Take the city, for instance, it's never fully explained how the monetary system works or where the electricity is coming from. I was able to suspend my disbelief for the latter in Dawn of the Dead, but I'm not willing to let Romero pull the same trick twice, especially when the inner workings of the city should have been further explored. The movie's social commentary feels like a slapdash effort of contemporary issues tossed together without any real coherency, with characters acting in blatantly idiotic fashion for no other purpose than to continue serving the commentary. The original Dawn of the Dead's commentary on consumerism worked because it was a natural outgrowth of the way the characters' believably behaved (if you had free reign to a mall, you likely wouldn't want to leave, would you?).Yet here, Romero feels compelled to ensure that Hopper's character won't dare negotiate, even preferring to leave the city (to go where exactly?) and kill an associate rather than give up five million bucks. To keep the commentary going, Romero even has Hopper take all his cash with him, even though I had to wonder what it was good for. Considering his demands, the same problem also applies to Cholo. Are there other cities/outposts out there using the same currency as well? If so, why not at least mention it so we don't question the characters' motivations, especially considering it's the basic framework that leads to so many deaths later in the film.There are further instances of stupidity, such as Riley choosing not to warn anyone inside the city about Big Daddy. The soldiers protecting the city prove incompetent in almost every fashion, with one guard actually rappelling into a crowd of zombies. Later in the film, there's even a guy who wears headphones while he's outside the city, by himself, and not at all far from known zombie territory. This scene is also indicative of the countless jump scares Romero attempts, all of them obvious and hilariously overdone.As for the zombies, there's the storyline involving Big Daddy, an undead gas station attendant who's inexplicably getting smarter. Much of the appeal of zombies is seeing them act out as mindless drones with no other motivation than to eat human flesh. That Big Daddy is able to think and seems to actually want revenge for his fallen zombie brethren completely mutes the sense of dread and terror that came with zombies acting on just pure instinct. Most astoundingly, Romero takes this a step further and actually wants us to sympathize with the zombies. I shouldn't be surprised by this development, as it's all been clearly leading up to this point since Bub's humanity in Day of the Dead and the constant "they're us, we're them" lines. Doesn't mean I have to like it, especially when the previous installments have made it clear being a zombie isn't something to cherish and the general fact that they like to eat people doesn't exactly make me want to side with them. For me, LOTD continues Romero's downward spiral, and I still haven't liked a movie of his since the 80s.

George A. Romero returns to the zombie flick twenty years after his last dip into the genre with 'Land Of The Dead (2005)', a post-apocalyptic tale of human survivors in an undead-infested land. The picture deals with the class system, seeing its major setting - a walled city with a shopping mall at its centre - ruled by a rich board of directors who use the promise of a better life inside the tower to manipulate those who aren't fortunate enough to ignore the chaos outside. Continuing the 'smart zombie' theme of 'Day Of The Dead (1985)', the flick features a focal ghoul who becomes more intelligent and cunning as the narrative unfolds. The picture features plenty of neck-biting, blood-spurting, head-crushing carnage and it moves at a pretty quick pace, too. Its plot is pretty thin and its characters are all, essentially, stereotypes, but it's a fun experience throughout. It isn't as good as Romero's previous zombie stuff, partially because its subtext isn't as strong. Still, it's an enjoyable action-horror piece nevertheless. 7/10

This review contains spoilers.Land of the Dead is a post-apocalyptic horror movie that premiered in 2005. The movie is directed and written by George A. Romero. The movie stars Simon Baker, Dennis Hopper, and Asia Argento. A feudal like government exists in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where a city of humans hold out against the hordes of the undead. The undead meanwhile evolve and begin reasoning.Land of the Dead is a movie that is incredibly theme heavy. This theme carries on into the movie in many ways and even ways that does not make sense. Land of the Dead has a theme of capitalism and greed being the primary focus. The zombies themselves can be seen as the downtrodden and the people that are thrown away. The zombies themselves begin evolving and eventually topple the city of Fiddler's Green.The main character of this movie are Riley Denbo played by Simon Baker. Riley and his crew are survivors that work for Paul Kaufman. The crew wish to retrieve the armored vehicle "Dead Reckoning" from Cholo who stole it. This plot is really meant to make Fiddler's Green weaker to the zombie attack. It felt contrived and as the armored personnel vehicle should have been more heavily guarded.Anyone that expected a straightforward zombie movie with survival themes will not find it here. The humans in this movie are the focus with the zombies being lead by "Big Daddy." The zombies and the humans are the focus here and not on simple survival. This is shown clearly in the ending where the survivors from Fiddler's Green are shown allowing the undead to leave. This is one of the aspects of the movie that makes it hard to appreciate. The undead are always this enemy that will kill the living, but the main characters allow them to leave.The overall direction of the movie is adequate and anyone expecting thrills from a zombie movie will get that here. This movie does have twists in its story that makes for a non-generic zombie movie.I would recommend "Land of the Dead".Grade: C.

This review contains some spoilers, but don't be afraid to read it if you're planning to see the movie, it won't change much, if anything, except perhaps your will to see it.I find it quite difficult to grasp how so many people could still give this movie such a high score. I think it somehow must have something to do with people hyping the movie since it's the successor to Dawn Of The Dead (DOTD) or something, but seriously, they're all wrong, and I'll tell you why.I too went in to see more of the (in my opinion pretty good) Dawn Of The Dead, and was expecting a bit less of course, since sequels are always worse than the first one. Point proved once more.A few comparisons perhaps to show you what I mean: In DOTD, the zombies were... well, zombies. In Land Of The Dead (LOTD) the zombies have somehow "evolved" to have some kind of intelligence, with 1 commander-zombie who somehow manages to lead them all with a few grunts, giving the others orders. This is what destroyed the movie from the very beginning. I mean come on, "they're trying to act like us." (one of the first lines in the movie) and then you see a zombie couple walking hand in hand, a band of zombies trying to play something, and the list goes on. That's not what we're here for, you know? It doesn't feel like you're watching a zombie movie, it feels like you're watching Revenge Of The Mentally Challenged, and it isn't working.I don't want to see a zombie with enough intelligence to fire a gun (seriously) or who knows that he can make a car explode by soaking it in gasoline first and rolling a burning keg of gas (which appeared out of nowhere) towards it, and I doubt anybody else was waiting for that either.The scares are all extremely predictable by the way.One of the aspects that made DOTD good to great, was the awesome job the crew did with the masks of the zombies. This is not the case in LOTD, you only get about 3 mass zombie scenes, the other scenes containing zombies are always close-ups of the same 5 zombies that hang around the commander-zombie, and only 1 of them (the girl with the slashed mouth) looks like how a zombie should look, the others just appear to have had a reversed face lift.There is no depth to any of the characters. In DOTD, you had some outspoken personalities, here you have the stereotypical rebel-hero, the love-potential rebel female (which is a prostitute in this movie, nice twist on the whole Romeo and Juliet thing, I'll give them that), a retard that somehow is able to fire a gun with inhuman precision, and a few mercenaries (like the humongous fat Samoan guy) but who don't do *anything* at all in the movie except just standing there and trying to look cool.When I thought the movie would finally kick off, the end credits rolled across the screen, and the whole theater was going "what the ****?", really. Everybody there was disappointed, everybody.Just as you felt it had potential to burst into something great, it was over, and you realize you have just watched 90 minutes of pure time wasting. Nothing has been told, and nothing has happened during the movie.Also, the tank-like car they use to raid surrounding villages is over the top and overused, and I didn't think it had anything cool about it, at all. They tried to revoke the busting-out feeling from DOTD with those fortified trucks I think, but again, it didn't work.Everything was there though; the tower as a last stand (which takes only one 2 minute scene in the whole movie when it is invaded by the zombies), the expertise from DOTD should have created even more and better looking zombies, the concept was a great base to build off (the remaining humans walled in in a city with the undead controlling the rest of the world),...But they didn't do anything with it and decided to just create a rip-off and milk the movie dry. And I don't blame anybody for that, but don't expect me to like it when you don't finish the job.The final straw for me was the ending scene, when the zombies have taken over one of the *last* remaining human cities (remember, they control the rest of the world) and the main character with his finger on the button to shoot a few rockets in the mass of zombies, decides not to do it and just leave them to raid the city and it's inhabitants, since "they're just like us, they just want a place to call home", and then drives off launching fireworks with his truck.I'm not kidding, I swear.So there I was, both mouth and eyes wide open, trying to subdue the urge to let a well-meant "what the **** was that" slip from my lips while the end credits were rolling across the screen, having wasted a perfect evening while I could have been watching any other movie, which would have had a good chance of being better than this one.If you read this and decide that perhaps you should see a different movie, I think that would be a wise decision.If you have read this review, and you decide that you still have to go and see this movie, I promise you'll get what you deserve.Have a good life.

George A. Romero's long-awaited return to the genre he helped create is a very, very mixed bad if not a consistently entertaining one.Romero's greatest strength as a director have always been his creativity, creating iconic moments and literally raising the zombie from the ground up on low budgets and tight schedules. Thus, it's more than a little disappointing to see LAND, the first in his DEAD series to see major studio backing and his highest-budget to date, be so riddled with a distinct lack of imagination. Romero's depiction of a zombie-infested, post-apocalypse never feels as bleak or gritty as the brief glimpses afforded in his predecessors. Characters still speak of things like cars, countries, and pop culture in the present tense; what's left of society still somehow needs and uses currency that should've long ago been rendered worthless. The class divide still looks like the class divide now, shopping malls and luxury highrises replete with waiting lists and Boards of Directors are still open and operational as usual. It all feels artificial, incomplete; not completely surprising for a script strung together from unused pieces of DAY, but nonetheless disappointing.The blockbuster budget is both a blessing and a curse. The scope of the film, though grander and more far-reaching then any of its predecessors combined, still feels claustrophobic and (ironically) devoid of life, and not in the good way. A long-dead Pittsburgh is never more than a few samey, empty-looking suburban streets with a suspicious lack of decaying carcasses and overgrown plant life. DAY's opening three minutes of a long-abandoned, desolate Orlando is more chilling and more grounded then anything this film has to offer. The relatively-straightforward plot often feels meandering and listless, going off on random tangents and introducing a rotating cast of wacky side characters more memorable than any of our leads. Said supporting cast, including standouts John Leguizamo, Robert Joy, Dennis Hopper, Eugene Clark, and Asia Argento, are this film's salvation, giving memorable and borderline-campy performances to make up for the nothing lead that is Simon Baker. He's a bland, generic "blonde hero guy" who's supposedly a misanthropic anti-hero but never comes across as anything more then mildly whiny, existing solely to perpetuate an already blatant political allegory that beats the audience over the head with how obvious it is. Then again, his spotlight is often drowned out by the mass of other supporting characters, which proves another fault by Romero. There are too many characters, and only so much runtime.And yet in spite of that, the film's still immeasurably entertaining. Romero injects that indelible "X" factor that permeated his previous works and made them so beloved. The zombie makeup and gore effects, courtesy of Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero, are as good as they've ever been (save for some questionable CGI). The aforementioned supporting cast is lively and plays off each other well. And the action is as solid and gloriously pulpy as its ever been, one of the few areas where the budget really shines. Romero's no slouch, even at his most average he's still miles ahead of many other directors in the same sphere. LAND is deeply flawed, deeply imperfect, but then again you could say the same about what came before. It's still a solid B-movie, and at the end of the day that's all George ever wanted to make.

"Night of the Living Dead" is one of the very creepiest movies ever made. "Dawn of the Dead" is both creepy and funny. "Day of the Dead" is not as good as those two, and this one is really disappointing. It looks and plays more like bad John Carpenter than like the great George Romero. Even for a zombie movie the plot is ridiculously skimpy and slack, and the "social commentary" that helped make "Night" and "Dawn" so good has become awfully juvenile. The decision to make the zombies a little smarter and more organized this time is a disaster: What was so frightening about them before was precisely that they were brainless, soulless former humans driven only by hunger, like human insects. Now they're just working-class stiffs revolting against their upper-class masters--ooo, spooky! Worst, though, is that this one totally lacks Romero's trademark atmosphere of dread--this just plays like a bunch of actors and extras going through the jerky motions in a lot of Halloween make-up. There isn't a scary or unself-conscious moment in it. As "Escape from L.A." is to "Escape from New York," "Land of the Dead" is to Romero's previous movies: a clanking, self- conscious homage to its own genre. All props to Romero as the godfather of zombie pics, but he's been way outgunned lately by "28 Days Later" and "Shaun of the Dead," both much creepier, scarier and funnier. Only the diehards could consider this one a "classic."

Just got back from the "industry screening" of Land, with GAR in attendance (5 rows ahead of me).Not to give out any spoilers, because I won't...but this film rocked. Does it have a different feel than Night, Dawn, and Day? Of course it does...why? Because of the fact that it's 2005, and movie making has changed over the course of the years. And also, this wasn't an independent film in the same way the other three were.BUT, what they got away with, gore-wise, was absolutely incredible. My buddy and I were laughing with glee through the entire flick at all of the violence. Let me put all doubts to rest: This IS a George A Romero zombie film. This is NOT a rip-off...it's the real deal. Head shots, decapitations, zombie biting people with the typical fleshy ripping...intestines...the works. I was SHOCKED at the amount of gore they managed to get into the film. I spoke with the Production Manager after wards, and he assured me that the gore in the film is NOTHING compared to what's going to be on the DVD. Oh, and on the way out, I got to shake GAR's hand and tell him that this is an incredible film. Honestly, it's this generation's "Dawn". (And yes, that means it's more fast paced etc etc, which some purists might be ticked off about). And when I say this is this generation's "Dawn", I mean THIS is the zombie movie people will remember years from now. It totally blows the other recently released zombie flicks (including the Dawn remake) out of the water. The acting was excellent all around...and I mean all around. There were no bad performances. Even Dennis Hopper and John Leguizamo, who both were put down on the message board for being in the film, were amazing. Hell, even the zombies kicked ass.Anyway, that's all I'll say. You guys will either love it or hate it. I loved it.Final word: Watch for the priest zombie. You'll know what I mean when you see it...hilarious. And watch for the arm scene...a hand upheld in a foggy mist...you'll understand when you see that too. Also, watch for the hilarious departure of two of Dennis Hopper's assistants...his personal assistant and his butler. LOL funny.

It's so odd to read the reviews, they're either scathing or wonderful, such passion for such a movie. I'll be honest, I think it's just an average movie, I know it's fifteen years since the release date, but many movies become classics, and hold up very well. I would say this holds up moderately well.The story is decent, the special effects are decent, plenty of blood and gore. However, when I watch a zombie film I look for a little bit of originality, something unique in story, production, cast etc, that's the problem, there is nothing which sets this film apart, the previous films have much more of an impact, this one is a bit lacking somehow.It still packs a punch, it's still watchable, 6/10.

Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of George Romero's previous films, especially the dead series. I thought he really hit his stride with Day of the Dead making a slick, structurally sophisticated continuation of his original idea. Not many people can pull off a sequel and I thought he did it twice with Dawn and Day. I also think he had something quite interesting to say with each of those films, layering thematic commentary under the story without distracting from main story elements or themes. His films were always about the shortcomings of man and the inability to work together in the face of danger. His films were always about the people, not the zombies.But now he has tried so hard to make a political statement that he has hammered into his own genre at the expense of the film. It was interesting in Day when the scientist discovers that a zombie can regain some latent memory and begin to function in a more human way. I was very powerful when that zombie musters up just enough motor skill and latent memory to shoot the villain. It feels like a stretch to say that the zombies, or even the one zombie, in Land could make a conversion of understanding that leads an all out revolt. On an intellectual level, I understand it, but it just didn't work for me. This seems to me like a bigger deviation from the Romero concept then some of the things complained about in the many Romero inspired films recently.The world described in the previews and press material doesn't seem fully realized. There is a huge divide between the rich and the poor. Why? How did it get that way. It doesn't seem like that would function well under the circumstances of the world as it is, especially in a small society. Why don't we find out anything about how this place works? How does Denis Hopper maintain his power? It is presented as a concept without any real thought. In the original film "The Island of Lost Souls" Doctor Moreau controls his population of beasts with fear. He cracks the whip, recites the law, and talks about the house of pain, which the audience knows to be the doctor's laboratory, but the beasts know it as a building where screams are heard. This is a stunningly well designed political metaphor. In Land of the Dead, I couldn't help thinking that the underlying political message was driving the story and that questionable things were written into the story for the wrong reasons. Money is a major plot device. Denis Hopper tries to escape the city with two large bags of money. What good is money outside the city? I was wondering, what good is money inside the city? Money only works if people believe in the underlying value of it. Most countries in the real world can't keep a stable currency. There is an aerial shot of the city during the day showing the streets deserted. Why are the streets deserted? Where are all the people? Later we see the same shot only the streets are now filled with Zombies. The characters keep talking about going to Canada as a safe haven. Why? Why is Canada safer than the United States. I was left to believe that this was more political commentary. Why are the Zombies trying to get to the city? They seem to be driven by some underlying, dare I say it, political motivation.The film as a whole seemed less like a story of characters in a horrific world established in the earlier films, and more like a series of one dimensional vignettes based on thin political ideology  Rich verses poor, violence in America, mismanagement of government in post 9-11 society, negotiating with terrorists, yeah we get it. Not so subtle.

Simon Baker leads in this film as a mercenary who wants to head up North. Maybe the undead do not like the cold. He find himself trapped between various warring factions, including a ruthless CEO (Dennis Hopper) who offers safety to the wealthy while allowing the unwashed masses to fend for themselves, a fellow mercenary (John Leguizamo) who will sacrifice anyone to advance his own agenda, and hordes of zombies who are starting to take steps up the evolutionary ladder. They actually used a gun in this film. First time I've seen a zombie do more than eat. They even went in the water. Apes don't do that! Lots of blood, but there was less action than I've seen and more talking.I love John Leguizamo, and that made it worth my time. Seeing Asia Argento (xXx) wasn't bad either.

Land of the Dead - The 4th part of George A. Romero's zombie quadrillogy. It's been decades since the dead began to walk the Earth, and now they practically own it (except for Canada for some reason). There is one last little mega-city that is surrounded by electric fences, armed patrols and barbed wire on one side, and nothing but water on all other four sides, because the dead supposedly don't like water. Despite the fact that the surrounding lands are rife with zombies, this metropolis is incredibly corrupt. All thanks to evil bureaucrat Kaufman (Dennis Hooper, who I had a ball watching) who makes all but a select few rich folks (who have never seen or fought a real zombie) live in slums. There you can get your picture taken with zombies, or watch zombie fights (they fight over animals and the occasional human). There are a few mercenaries paid to make runs in a giant tank truck for precious commodities in the outside world.Now I like George and could thank him endlessly for starting the zombie franchise, but he has always favored gore just a little more over character development, and has always liked his zombies just a LOT more than his humans. Heck in this movie, the zombies are practically the good-guys! They're just like you and me, except they rip people's arms in two (and I do mean length-wise) and tear belly button rings out of people. They are actually pretty intelligent and moderately fast at walking. By far the biggest threats in Romero's movies (most notably "Big Daddy" (Eugene Clark). For the most part though, it works, and it's good gory fun. Except the character development thingy. While I don't begrudge Romero for having fun with his zombies, I wasn't too sympathetic to Riley (Simon Baker) or Slack (Asia Argento). Riley, like Romero it seems, is just tired of character development as he has Riley say "I'm fed up with back-stories". But Riley dear boy, that's how the audience grows to care about you. Slack almost kills several of her fellow team-mates and does not grow at all, but that's the script's fault. Both of these characters, however are played well for what the actors are given.Surprisingly the secondary characters are far more endearing. Cholo (John Leguizamo) was not only believable as a merc, but I was quite sympathetic to him as he realized that he was a pon. "Pilsbury" (Pedro Miguel Arce) and Charlie (Robert Joy) are endearing and funny.So the effects are good. The story is iffy. The acting is good. The character development is iffy. The ending is really lame. This gets an overall B

The undead have taken over the world. What traces of humanity remain have taken to backing themselves into protected cities and getting supplies by venturing out in heavily armoured groups to raid smaller towns. One such city is formerly Pittsburgh, where the rivers provide natural protection and those who organised themselves into leaders have created a world of near normality while the rest live in the streets with less material and more risk. One of the raiders (Riley) is sure that he has seen evidence of learning among the undead but events within the city itself cause him more concern as his former second-in-command decides to take violent revenge for being betrayed by city boss Kaufman.How you receive this film is more about you than the film itself (which I suppose is true of most things in a way  everything has a market somewhere). Those that will love it will be those looking for gore as their horror because the film delivers this in spades. The camera lingers on flesh eating, mutilation and some very painful sequences that had me looking away. However the problem for me was that it was just gore  not horror, not scares and not anything that made me feel uncomfortable in my own house. A minor criticism perhaps but let me assure you that me and zombie movies do not mix well and not only do I get scared during the films but also for days afterwards by the idea of it all.Surprisingly then I was able to watch Land of the Dead with a detached air and it never convinced me of the world I was being shown. Part of this is budget but that's not all of it as I never bought the characters or main story either. The story in particular narked me because it did dominate the main horror (the mass of undead) and spent too much time on the detail of the human interactions and betrayal. In itself this is not a killer and indeed recently I saw The Mist do a very good job of making human monsters just as scary as the rubber ones but here Romero doesn't make as much of his social commentary as he could have done  OK so we have the haves and have-nots but beyond that we don't get much in the way of intelligence.The cast reflect the low budget but are good enough for the level that this is working on. Baker is a bit bland but OK, while Leguizamo at least adds a bit of energy to his character. Hopper takes on a fairly easy role of just being a "Mr Big" character that even done in P Diddy/Daddy music videos in the past. Argento is sexy but little else while Joy is pretty good in his support character. Clark is better than a zombie character will get him credit for and makes his stuff quiet interesting and engaging. In regards getting the best "urgh" impact from his gore budget, Romero does well but I was surprised that he didn't do more as a writer or as director to do better with the characters or the tension/danger within the story; like I said, I was surprised by how much of an observer this film allowed me to be.Worth a look for gore fans and those seeking out some old school zombies in the middle of these modern "28 Days Later" type ones but really this film is a bit of a disappointment in just how average it is. The gore is great but it produces repulsion, not scares and Romero cannot create a sense of genuine horror or fear as he tries to deal with a narrative that takes more than it gives.

I love horror movies. I love zombie horror including Dawn of the Dead. Night of the Living Dead was okay. Dawn of the Dead was so good because it introduced us to true zombie horror and gore and there has since been no comparisons. It's difficult to scare us now with cheap zombie gags. It's boring. Land of the Dead lacks true creativity. It should have been made over 10 years ago then maybe it would be more than just average. This movie is AN OUTDATED IDEA. It lacks today's suspense and horror. Sure it is a social commentary but this is Hollywood not a political rally. Romero used dated ideas with dated gags. We've seen more than zombies devour human flesh. In fact, the gore scenes should have been used to help with the scares. One thing that this movie lacked was character. When we watch good horror movies we can't help but jump when Jaime Lee Curtis jumps in Halloween. I don't remember any of the characters names or any particular character scene that stood out. Spoiler: The smart zombie should have had his moment in the end only. Instead he's rallying the troops throughout the movie...bad, bad, story because now he's no longer scary or intimidating. Spoiler: Whats with the line of zombie at the pier. Zombies don't get in a soldier style formation when only 1 of them can somewhat think. Spoiler: Too much smart zombies make no scary zombies. Spoiler: Why would Dennis Hopper depend on band of misfits to do work including run most important offensive/defensive weapon (truck) rather than the well trained, paramilitary dressed, soldiers. Spoiler: The movie would have been more entertaining with the misfits trying to save a sighed city than showing the ruin-the-zombie picnic scene in the end. Romero did stick to his slow moving zombie tradition. I personally think he should have stepped it up. If they can get smarter, then they can get faster. This would have elevated the suspense and chases dramatically. I believe Romero should have used a scare to surprise us with zombie developments rather than waste movie time to explain the story. OVERALL i rate it a 6 because i seen a lot worst and i can understand Romero's attempts, yet and still isn't this suppose to be a horror movie?

While George Romero has become famous for his Living Dead series and the way it transformed the horror genre, he's also become famous for something else. The argument over whether or not he ever intended politics, let alone race politics to be part of his earlier films. At times he's insisted he didn't, at times he's somewhat coyly suggested he did. Either way, the politics in his earlier films were subdued and if any message could ultimately be taken from them it's that human beings must work together to survive. Personally I despise all the conjecture and "reading into" these or any movies at all but at times it's just impossible to avoid.Land of the Dead quickly became one of those political snafu's. Romero blamed the studio, the studio blamed Romero, ultimately who the hell knows what really happened. Either way it led Romero to swear off big studio backing for any future entries into the Living Dead series. So what's the big deal you wonder? Will it ruin the movie for you? Read on.The core of this film comes down to the rich taking advantage of the poor, that's not the problem. A sub plot is the desire of some of the poor to move up into the world of the rich and the desire of others to just get the hell away from the whole argument and live their lives in peace. That's not the problem either. The problem boils down to, believe it or not one annoying as hell and constantly used zombie. All the shots with this zombie who becomes the "leader" of an oddly intelligent bunch of fellow zombies were added in post production. The whole purpose was to add in an extra hint of race politics. If you watch the movie, you will instantly understand why this became a big deal. It adds an element of unbelievably cheesy stupidity to the film. It's just ridiculous.Romero has said that he was entirely opposed to the post production changes but was given an ultimatum, do it or the studio would scrap the movie. The studio has said there was never any such argument, it was all Romero's idea and when the movie wasn't as well received as he had hoped he looked for a scapegoat, it's ironic really because it's exactly the sort of tit for tat arguing that goes on in Romero's earlier movies when the zombie outbreak is beginning. To be honest the added scenes are so annoying that I've often considered re cutting the movie myself and for quite awhile there was a "fan" cut floating around that removed those scenes. Either way, ultimately the movie is what it is. Politics aside, silly added scenes aside it's really a very good movie with some really great acting. The writing is there, the story the direction and everything is all really top notch. Dennis Hopper plays your "greedy old rich bugger" quite well and John Leguizamo does a great job as does the rest of the cast. There's some really fantastic zombie gore to be had for all you gore hounds out there like me and that's thanks to Tom Savini. He really is a master of traditional special effects. On another note, die hard horror fans will love seeing Asia Argento in this movie as well.All in all, Romero has done better but this is really an enjoyable film and I think pretty much anyone should have a good time watching it. Provided your a horror fan, if your not then you really should get as far away from this movie as possible. You'll either throw up or have nightmares for the rest of your life...or both.

I have to say that Land of the Dead was a disappointment. The main strength of the other ...of the Dead -films was that they were very much believable. The characters felt like real people and the settings were realistic, as much as you can say that about a zombie movie. More to the point, those were serious movies.Land of the Dead on the other hand was silly. Soo, we have this cavalcade of blandly beautiful b-actors who have silly nicknames, the society is divided to haves and have-nots, the latter of which have a dirty face. The main character is so goddamn noble and righteous that he could have been ripped out of an American war movie. For some reason money is relevant and on the top of the food chain there is one guy, who in the end tries to make an escape with big bags of money. Haven't I seen this in a dozen bad 80's scifi and post holocaust films? Bland characters, silly setting, big plot holes, worn-out clichés, but also several good moments and jokes. Compared to other b-grade post-holocaust and zombie flicks, Land of the Dead was mediocre. Compared to Romero's other films, it was outright bad.

Most other comments seems to be infected by a classic case of -Let's read a plethora of theories and commentaries into this as an after-construction-kinda deal. It's easy to sum this movie up in one sentence: A violent story about a group of people in search for their missing car.This has been praised as a stand against class-society and apparently it should contain a vast amount on social commentary. Where? Name one action movie who hasn't got a rich villain and a poor hero or some misfit trying to set things right based on his unbreakable social pathos. And some of the huge plot holes:Well the monatery system in this movie can't be explained. Why does currency still work in a world where there a so few people, and plenty of goods to go around for everybody.The gated community is just a silly, awfully depicted place, instead of dealing with the situation they sit around drinking champagne and buying designer clothes. (Is this the huge social comment?!?)Why build a stupid land train when you can loot every tank regiment on Earth?Conclusion:After the three first (Night, Dawn and Day) Land... seems to be a world of it's own. It seems to be so far away from anything else, depicted in the first three, it could be a pilot for a TV-series.Many may complain about the one dimensioned actors but, be fair, how would ANY actor act in such a humourless, wafer thin story like this. The direction seems more to be inspired by army boot camp than any sort film-making. It follows the same concept over and over and over again: "Run-Shoot-Swear-Run-Shoot-Swear" And by God do not under any circumstances show any emotion except anger.I was almost breastfed with zombie movies and for almost 20 years it's been a great inspirational source. It pains me to see this movie and I hate to admit that not even me, one of the greatest fans on the genre, can protect Romero from this failure.Mr. Romero, get back to the drawing board, and better luck next time.I still have hope!

Zombies have taken over the world in Land of the Dead, the remaining survivors live within a walled city to keep the dead out. A revolution is brewing in a plan to overthrow the city. but outside the walls the zombies are developing their intelligence.The plot kind of sounds a bit lame, but it really does work well and this is a zombie flick that can be taken quite seriously. Romero has again created something great on a tight budget, and he has done well to make it look good, with some great make up effects. The cast are all pretty good, there are some good characters and the dialogue is effective.Overall Land of the Dead delivers all out zombie action that's great for fans of the genre, good work George.8/10

Now I know that this will anger some of the rave reviewers, but I am speaking honestly, and not bashing.First off, I am an avid Romero fan, having seen every 'Of the Dead' movie from the black and white original NIGHT, Dawn, and Day, the remade 'Night' and the remade 'Dawn'. I love zombie movies for the disturbing factors involved with trying to survive through the crisis.I'm talking about having to kill loved ones that turned, shooting neighbors, and old friends that you might come across,...shooting little children zombies (which I might add, there were NONE that I can remember seeing in this film...I might be mistaken). The thought of the dead returning to life and feeding off the living is a fear (although irrational) that a lot of people couldn't deal with.Now for the review: I will try to hold the spoilers to a minimum, because they are aggravating, I know. First, I like the idea of zombies learning to rationalize and communicate. It picks up where DAY left off,..I'll give GAR that much. As far as the lead zombie..I agree w/ a previous comment that they overused him. I didn't like the fact that only 1 was able to start thinking, instead of all of them at the same time. He remained a leader, and showed sorrow and anger when his fellow dead-ites were killed or injured. I don't like zombies w/ emotion. It doesn't work for me.I went into the theater KNOWING that this was going to be more of an action film than a horror film...anything with as much firepower as dead reckoning and tons of machine guns is self proclaiming. I was praying it wouldn't be Resident Evil 3. It wasn't a complete waste, seeing as how I got the ticket for free,...but the element of fear and horror from the other movies from GAR's series just wasn't prevalent enough for me. I'm glad it is doing so well...so hopefully GAR might get an inkling to make something else...but as far as this one goes, it just wasn't for me. I think HORROR when I go see a zombie movie. I went into this one...saw some good gore, and had a couple of chuckles, but I didn't go home with that good IL' zombie feeling that I get when I watch NOTLD or DOTD at night by myself in a dark room with the sound cranked.Go see the movie for yourself, you won't be angry when you leave,...you might be happy.I'm just a weird person with a weird ass perspective. Or maybe everyone else is a mindless zombie that is distracted by big noises and funny one-liners and bright lights (for those who have seen it, I'm referring to SKYFLOWERS) and doesn't know what a zombie movie is supposed to be.Just for the record...the scene where dead reckoning goes up to the gates of whatever that fancy hotel was and sees a big mass of zombies tearing up all the rich people, and you hear screaming and bloodletting.....that was the best part of the movie for me.

This movie was terrible! The storyline - can't use the word plot as that would give it too much credit - was tedious! Some say it was a great perspective on class? Are you kidding me!!! From the HORRIBLE acting to the complete and utter Lack of dialog, characters changed motives, desires and allegiances so quickly without any second thoughts. Plus, a lot of scenes just plain didn't make Any Sense!*SPOILER* I realize that the two troops were sent up to keep an eye on our main characters but why in the world did the big guy suddenly knock out that woman?!?! What was with that? The gratuitous female-on-female scene? What purpose did that serve? Only the one zombie guy seemed to be learning anything and leading the troops yet was able to avoid huge blasts from explosives while zombies around him exploded? These characters have such amazing aim at such strange points but then they can't kill this One Zombie? And everyone in the van just blindly follows Choro but then immediately switches alliances? And what was with the girl who was ready to nuke the entire city but then, when asked to fire on a bunch of zombies and half-eaten civilians all of a sudden she has a heart? Plus, even after Choro turned into a zombie he was able to carry out his revenge? Not only was he able to remember to kill that CEO guy but also he was able to find him that easily? And what was with the horribly, cheesy ending where they just want a place to live?!? Uh, hello, have we forgotten that THEY ARE DEAD!!!! Kinda the Premise of the movie!!!Oh I just was SO disappointed - and I gotta say, I didn't have high expectations or anything, I just couldn't believe how bad it really was. My boyfriend and I looked at each other after the movie and were so angry - he had been particularly excited about this one and I thought the idea that the zombies would possibly be learning something well that was neat. OH SO SAD when a Great series like this jumps the shark!

i just watched land of the dead. finally after watching every single other romero zombie movie i finally decided to buy Land of the Dead. mainly because it was on sale at 50% off at suncoast's closing out sale. but i digress...HOLY SPIZZLE!!!! this movie was just..... AMAZING!!! maybe its because i was a tad disappointed with the ending of romero's day of the dead (although truth be told day of the dead was an all in all great movie). i would say my opinion is based in large part on the fact that i had just watched zack snyder's dawn of the dead about a week ago and was horribly HORRIBLY disappointed. but man! i just watched Land of the Dead... WOW! This movie was outstanding.it had everything! the classic george romero plot line. As with all of his other zombies movies, the story revolves mostly around the living characters and how they interact amongst one another. in this case, the world is completely full of zombies and a small city is left with the last of the world's living inhabitants caged up in a walled city. The zombies are used merely as a tool to set the stage for a survival struggle. It also did a fine job reflecting economy struggle and social content. And to top everything all off with a candied cherry (although i rather hate candied cherries so lets just say strawberry) it had a great cast! i always felt that many of george romero's previous movies suffered from horrible acting. but this was definitely not the case with this film. john leguizamo pulled off a spot on performance of the rebellious lone wolf figure, while simon baker's good guy role was played out perfectly. Dennis Baker was a bit on the cheesy villain side, but hey, thats how it was written and he pulled it off.all in all i do believe romero finally created the full budget dream film he set out to create since his first film "night of the living dead". kudos to you george. kudos.

A great Zombie movie written and directed by the Zombie master himself George A Romero who created the Night of the living Dead film series which is mostly known for the second entry in the series Dawn of the Dead which is one of the greatest Zombie movies ever made.This entry in the series takes place almost two decades after the Zombie outbreak where Zombies now cover the earth and whats left of the humans now live in a secure city lead by the super rich while the poor scavenge for food and supplies and man the defences of the city the scavenging crews are lead by Riley Denbo (Simon Baker) who wants out of the city while his friend Cholo Demora (John Leguizamo) wants into the tower where the super rich live but after a midnight raid on a small town filled with zombies goes badly they end up leading a horde of zombies right to the city's gate now they have bigger problems to deal with as the dead start working together to get there meal.The blood and gore looks great and has much more detailed scenes of zombies eating people than most movies are willing to show especially in the Directors cut of the movie which is more graphic.The makeup and green screen effects are pretty good for there time a little obvious now but in 2005 were passable also great acting all round the characters likable and unique.I recommend this movie to any fan of zombie movies especially ones with plenty of blood and gore and a decent budget to make it look better than B movie zombie movies.

Nobody wanted this film to be good more than I. Last year when the script was posted online I read it in one sitting from start to finish. Totally fascinated. I thought it was a brilliant exercise in class warfare, race, the human condition, etc. In other words, more than the mindless Italian zombie movie, and more than anything Romero did before. It contained some of the elements that he retrieved from the original "Day of the Dead" script (that he wasn't able to film back then when his budget was cut by 2/3 or so)...Anyway, so I came to this movie with high expectations based on the phenomenal reviews by both media and the fanboys...maybe I shouldn't have read so much for this has to be the most disappointing movie of the year! First, if you come into this looking for gore, you are going to be disappointed. I believe there is more cannibalism and blood in last year's "Dawn" remake...weird that no one mentions that. But worse than that is the script. I get the feeling Romero had to cut a big bit down (what else is new, George?) from the script I read online because most of the character development was completely gone. Only "Cholo" (nice name) had any kind of motivation and even that could have been explained a lot better. Sure, he represents the working class that wants to move up in society but they could have done more with it...the scene where he gets blown off by Hopper looks like it was rushed. There was zero subtlety...not that well done. Simon Baker's character fared worse. We get the feeling that he and the Robert Joy guy had a bit of a history working together --that's it for his back story. A bit about his dead sister, nothing more. Sorry, it's hard to care about characters we don't know anything about. Contrast this with the scene in the "Dawn" remake where you actually had people sitting around talking about their stories, where they came from, etc. Like night and day, no pun intended.As for the "Fiddler's Green" refuge for the rich-- I was looking forward to seeing something out of Ballard's "High Rise" the way it was described in the press but Romero hardly even showed it or explained anything about it. Who were the people who lived there? How did Hopper decide who gets to live there and who stays in the city streets? where did the city people live? Could we see their housing situation? Too many questions, not enough answers. If a point was trying to be made about classism -- and it could have been a damn good one -- it sure wasn't made in this movie.

Rating: * 1/2 out of **** Land of the Dead has been long-awaited for a good two decades. Set presumably some time after Day of the Dead, the plot focuses on a human population that has managed to survive by barricading themselves within the "remains" of Pittsburgh by means of guards and electrified fences (as well as rivers that are bordering the city). The rich reside in a tower called Fiddler's Green but everyone else is forced to live in the streets, with only the false hope of being able to attain high-class status.One guy dissatisfied with living in the streets, Cholo (John Leguizamo), doesn't take kindly to the mayor's (Dennis Hopper) refusal, especially having been his lackey for three years with the expectation of reward. So Cholo steals the armored vehicle Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler's Green unless he gets his five million dollars (which is the amount needed to get high-class status, but did he really expect to be welcomed into Fiddler's Green with open arms after this incident?). Refusing to cooperate, the mayor hires Riley (Simon Baker) to bring Dead Reckoning back. Meanwhile, the undead are planning to invade the city thanks to the evolving zombie called Big Daddy, and given this couldn't happen at a worst possible time, you can guess what'll happen next.I'm going to put it bluntly, this film is by far the worst of Romero's zombie movies, lacking in so many ways that I would still feel the same way even if I didn't have its predecessors to compare it with. But there are its predecessors, and having already seen three prior films in which characters must hold off scores of zombies at bay from inside some "safe" location before it's ultimately penetrated by the undead, let's just say seeing this a fourth time gets a little repetitive.The film does have elements worth appreciating, the cinematography is excellent and easily the best of the series; I especially loved the stylish and creepy nighttime shot of zombies shuffling within a fog-shrouded forest. The movie is also the most action-packed of the series, so the non-stop gunfire keeps the movie watchable. The production values are also pretty good considering the budgetary limitations (some of the f/x still look pretty weak, though).Otherwise, LOTD is rushed, unfulfilling, and does little its predecessors haven't already accomplished. What new material it does aim for is poorly conceived, a shocker considering Romero's had twenty years to mull over this material. Take the city, for instance, it's never fully explained how the monetary system works or where the electricity is coming from. I was able to suspend my disbelief for the latter in Dawn of the Dead, but I'm not willing to let Romero pull the same trick twice, especially when the inner workings of the city should have been further explored. The movie's social commentary feels like a slapdash effort of contemporary issues tossed together without any real coherency, with characters acting in blatantly idiotic fashion for no other purpose than to continue serving the commentary. The original Dawn of the Dead's commentary on consumerism worked because it was a natural outgrowth of the way the characters' believably behaved (if you had free reign to a mall, you likely wouldn't want to leave, would you?).Yet here, Romero feels compelled to ensure that Hopper's character won't dare negotiate, even preferring to leave the city (to go where exactly?) and kill an associate rather than give up five million bucks. To keep the commentary going, Romero even has Hopper take all his cash with him, even though I had to wonder what it was good for. Considering his demands, the same problem also applies to Cholo. Are there other cities/outposts out there using the same currency as well? If so, why not at least mention it so we don't question the characters' motivations, especially considering it's the basic framework that leads to so many deaths later in the film.There are further instances of stupidity, such as Riley choosing not to warn anyone inside the city about Big Daddy. The soldiers protecting the city prove incompetent in almost every fashion, with one guard actually rappelling into a crowd of zombies. Later in the film, there's even a guy who wears headphones while he's outside the city, by himself, and not at all far from known zombie territory. This scene is also indicative of the countless jump scares Romero attempts, all of them obvious and hilariously overdone.As for the zombies, there's the storyline involving Big Daddy, an undead gas station attendant who's inexplicably getting smarter. Much of the appeal of zombies is seeing them act out as mindless drones with no other motivation than to eat human flesh. That Big Daddy is able to think and seems to actually want revenge for his fallen zombie brethren completely mutes the sense of dread and terror that came with zombies acting on just pure instinct. Most astoundingly, Romero takes this a step further and actually wants us to sympathize with the zombies. I shouldn't be surprised by this development, as it's all been clearly leading up to this point since Bub's humanity in Day of the Dead and the constant "they're us, we're them" lines. Doesn't mean I have to like it, especially when the previous installments have made it clear being a zombie isn't something to cherish and the general fact that they like to eat people doesn't exactly make me want to side with them. For me, LOTD continues Romero's downward spiral, and I still haven't liked a movie of his since the 80s.

In a near future, the zombies are all around the world, and the human society is restructured and adapted for the new reality. In a protected city ruled by the powerful Kaufman (Dennis Hopper), the upper class has the usual privileges living in a fancy well-supplied building, while the poor people lives on the streets. Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo) belong to a team that bring supplies (food, medicine etc.) to the city using a heavy truck called Dead Reckoning and designed by Riley. When Cholo is betrayed by Kaufman, he steals the Dead Reckoning and threatens Kaufman, who requests Riley to retrieve the vehicle, with the support of his friend Charlie (Robert Joy) and Slack (Asia Argento). But the dead are smarter and organized under the leadership of Big Daddy (Eugene Clark)."Land of the Dead" is a great zombie movie. The story is a sort of "Mad Max" with "The Night of the Living Dead", full of the usual clichés, but I liked it a lot. Dennis Hopper performs a character worse than the zombies, and John Leguizamo and Asia Argento are excellent as usual. Simon Baker is a charismatic leader, and there is a hook between Riley and Big Daddy for a possible sequel, that I hope comes true. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Terra dos Mortos" ("Land of the Dead")

George A. Romero returns to the zombie flick twenty years after his last dip into the genre with 'Land Of The Dead (2005)', a post-apocalyptic tale of human survivors in an undead-infested land. The picture deals with the class system, seeing its major setting - a walled city with a shopping mall at its centre - ruled by a rich board of directors who use the promise of a better life inside the tower to manipulate those who aren't fortunate enough to ignore the chaos outside. Continuing the 'smart zombie' theme of 'Day Of The Dead (1985)', the flick features a focal ghoul who becomes more intelligent and cunning as the narrative unfolds. The picture features plenty of neck-biting, blood-spurting, head-crushing carnage and it moves at a pretty quick pace, too. Its plot is pretty thin and its characters are all, essentially, stereotypes, but it's a fun experience throughout. It isn't as good as Romero's previous zombie stuff, partially because its subtext isn't as strong. Still, it's an enjoyable action-horror piece nevertheless. 7/10

George A. Romero's long-awaited return to the genre he helped create is a very, very mixed bad if not a consistently entertaining one.Romero's greatest strength as a director have always been his creativity, creating iconic moments and literally raising the zombie from the ground up on low budgets and tight schedules. Thus, it's more than a little disappointing to see LAND, the first in his DEAD series to see major studio backing and his highest-budget to date, be so riddled with a distinct lack of imagination. Romero's depiction of a zombie-infested, post-apocalypse never feels as bleak or gritty as the brief glimpses afforded in his predecessors. Characters still speak of things like cars, countries, and pop culture in the present tense; what's left of society still somehow needs and uses currency that should've long ago been rendered worthless. The class divide still looks like the class divide now, shopping malls and luxury highrises replete with waiting lists and Boards of Directors are still open and operational as usual. It all feels artificial, incomplete; not completely surprising for a script strung together from unused pieces of DAY, but nonetheless disappointing.The blockbuster budget is both a blessing and a curse. The scope of the film, though grander and more far-reaching then any of its predecessors combined, still feels claustrophobic and (ironically) devoid of life, and not in the good way. A long-dead Pittsburgh is never more than a few samey, empty-looking suburban streets with a suspicious lack of decaying carcasses and overgrown plant life. DAY's opening three minutes of a long-abandoned, desolate Orlando is more chilling and more grounded then anything this film has to offer. The relatively-straightforward plot often feels meandering and listless, going off on random tangents and introducing a rotating cast of wacky side characters more memorable than any of our leads. Said supporting cast, including standouts John Leguizamo, Robert Joy, Dennis Hopper, Eugene Clark, and Asia Argento, are this film's salvation, giving memorable and borderline-campy performances to make up for the nothing lead that is Simon Baker. He's a bland, generic "blonde hero guy" who's supposedly a misanthropic anti-hero but never comes across as anything more then mildly whiny, existing solely to perpetuate an already blatant political allegory that beats the audience over the head with how obvious it is. Then again, his spotlight is often drowned out by the mass of other supporting characters, which proves another fault by Romero. There are too many characters, and only so much runtime.And yet in spite of that, the film's still immeasurably entertaining. Romero injects that indelible "X" factor that permeated his previous works and made them so beloved. The zombie makeup and gore effects, courtesy of Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero, are as good as they've ever been (save for some questionable CGI). The aforementioned supporting cast is lively and plays off each other well. And the action is as solid and gloriously pulpy as its ever been, one of the few areas where the budget really shines. Romero's no slouch, even at his most average he's still miles ahead of many other directors in the same sphere. LAND is deeply flawed, deeply imperfect, but then again you could say the same about what came before. It's still a solid B-movie, and at the end of the day that's all George ever wanted to make.

This review contains some spoilers, but don't be afraid to read it if you're planning to see the movie, it won't change much, if anything, except perhaps your will to see it.I find it quite difficult to grasp how so many people could still give this movie such a high score. I think it somehow must have something to do with people hyping the movie since it's the successor to Dawn Of The Dead (DOTD) or something, but seriously, they're all wrong, and I'll tell you why.I too went in to see more of the (in my opinion pretty good) Dawn Of The Dead, and was expecting a bit less of course, since sequels are always worse than the first one. Point proved once more.A few comparisons perhaps to show you what I mean: In DOTD, the zombies were... well, zombies. In Land Of The Dead (LOTD) the zombies have somehow "evolved" to have some kind of intelligence, with 1 commander-zombie who somehow manages to lead them all with a few grunts, giving the others orders. This is what destroyed the movie from the very beginning. I mean come on, "they're trying to act like us." (one of the first lines in the movie) and then you see a zombie couple walking hand in hand, a band of zombies trying to play something, and the list goes on. That's not what we're here for, you know? It doesn't feel like you're watching a zombie movie, it feels like you're watching Revenge Of The Mentally Challenged, and it isn't working.I don't want to see a zombie with enough intelligence to fire a gun (seriously) or who knows that he can make a car explode by soaking it in gasoline first and rolling a burning keg of gas (which appeared out of nowhere) towards it, and I doubt anybody else was waiting for that either.The scares are all extremely predictable by the way.One of the aspects that made DOTD good to great, was the awesome job the crew did with the masks of the zombies. This is not the case in LOTD, you only get about 3 mass zombie scenes, the other scenes containing zombies are always close-ups of the same 5 zombies that hang around the commander-zombie, and only 1 of them (the girl with the slashed mouth) looks like how a zombie should look, the others just appear to have had a reversed face lift.There is no depth to any of the characters. In DOTD, you had some outspoken personalities, here you have the stereotypical rebel-hero, the love-potential rebel female (which is a prostitute in this movie, nice twist on the whole Romeo and Juliet thing, I'll give them that), a retard that somehow is able to fire a gun with inhuman precision, and a few mercenaries (like the humongous fat Samoan guy) but who don't do *anything* at all in the movie except just standing there and trying to look cool.When I thought the movie would finally kick off, the end credits rolled across the screen, and the whole theater was going "what the ****?", really. Everybody there was disappointed, everybody.Just as you felt it had potential to burst into something great, it was over, and you realize you have just watched 90 minutes of pure time wasting. Nothing has been told, and nothing has happened during the movie.Also, the tank-like car they use to raid surrounding villages is over the top and overused, and I didn't think it had anything cool about it, at all. They tried to revoke the busting-out feeling from DOTD with those fortified trucks I think, but again, it didn't work.Everything was there though; the tower as a last stand (which takes only one 2 minute scene in the whole movie when it is invaded by the zombies), the expertise from DOTD should have created even more and better looking zombies, the concept was a great base to build off (the remaining humans walled in in a city with the undead controlling the rest of the world),...But they didn't do anything with it and decided to just create a rip-off and milk the movie dry. And I don't blame anybody for that, but don't expect me to like it when you don't finish the job.The final straw for me was the ending scene, when the zombies have taken over one of the *last* remaining human cities (remember, they control the rest of the world) and the main character with his finger on the button to shoot a few rockets in the mass of zombies, decides not to do it and just leave them to raid the city and it's inhabitants, since "they're just like us, they just want a place to call home", and then drives off launching fireworks with his truck.I'm not kidding, I swear.So there I was, both mouth and eyes wide open, trying to subdue the urge to let a well-meant "what the **** was that" slip from my lips while the end credits were rolling across the screen, having wasted a perfect evening while I could have been watching any other movie, which would have had a good chance of being better than this one.If you read this and decide that perhaps you should see a different movie, I think that would be a wise decision.If you have read this review, and you decide that you still have to go and see this movie, I promise you'll get what you deserve.Have a good life.

I was able to catch an advance screening with friends last night, and maybe it was just the mood we were in, but we had a blast. It took me a few minutes to get the direction George was going with this one, but once I did, it cranked on almost every cylinder. The first thing to note is this is not a serious, somber, scare you out of your pants zombie movie. What it actually plays out as instead is a social commentary on class, politics, and stereo types, while having a good time doing it. Think more Evil Dead meets Mad Max meets Night of the Living Dead, and you'll get a clearer picture of the movie George has made here. Yes, it is very violent, and yes, there are plenty of "feedings." Highly recommended for those whose take zombie movies as seriously as they should.

This review contains spoilers.Land of the Dead is a post-apocalyptic horror movie that premiered in 2005. The movie is directed and written by George A. Romero. The movie stars Simon Baker, Dennis Hopper, and Asia Argento. A feudal like government exists in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where a city of humans hold out against the hordes of the undead. The undead meanwhile evolve and begin reasoning.Land of the Dead is a movie that is incredibly theme heavy. This theme carries on into the movie in many ways and even ways that does not make sense. Land of the Dead has a theme of capitalism and greed being the primary focus. The zombies themselves can be seen as the downtrodden and the people that are thrown away. The zombies themselves begin evolving and eventually topple the city of Fiddler's Green.The main character of this movie are Riley Denbo played by Simon Baker. Riley and his crew are survivors that work for Paul Kaufman. The crew wish to retrieve the armored vehicle "Dead Reckoning" from Cholo who stole it. This plot is really meant to make Fiddler's Green weaker to the zombie attack. It felt contrived and as the armored personnel vehicle should have been more heavily guarded.Anyone that expected a straightforward zombie movie with survival themes will not find it here. The humans in this movie are the focus with the zombies being lead by "Big Daddy." The zombies and the humans are the focus here and not on simple survival. This is shown clearly in the ending where the survivors from Fiddler's Green are shown allowing the undead to leave. This is one of the aspects of the movie that makes it hard to appreciate. The undead are always this enemy that will kill the living, but the main characters allow them to leave.The overall direction of the movie is adequate and anyone expecting thrills from a zombie movie will get that here. This movie does have twists in its story that makes for a non-generic zombie movie.I would recommend "Land of the Dead".Grade: C.

"Night of the Living Dead" is one of the very creepiest movies ever made. "Dawn of the Dead" is both creepy and funny. "Day of the Dead" is not as good as those two, and this one is really disappointing. It looks and plays more like bad John Carpenter than like the great George Romero. Even for a zombie movie the plot is ridiculously skimpy and slack, and the "social commentary" that helped make "Night" and "Dawn" so good has become awfully juvenile. The decision to make the zombies a little smarter and more organized this time is a disaster: What was so frightening about them before was precisely that they were brainless, soulless former humans driven only by hunger, like human insects. Now they're just working-class stiffs revolting against their upper-class masters--ooo, spooky! Worst, though, is that this one totally lacks Romero's trademark atmosphere of dread--this just plays like a bunch of actors and extras going through the jerky motions in a lot of Halloween make-up. There isn't a scary or unself-conscious moment in it. As "Escape from L.A." is to "Escape from New York," "Land of the Dead" is to Romero's previous movies: a clanking, self- conscious homage to its own genre. All props to Romero as the godfather of zombie pics, but he's been way outgunned lately by "28 Days Later" and "Shaun of the Dead," both much creepier, scarier and funnier. Only the diehards could consider this one a "classic."

Just got back from the "industry screening" of Land, with GAR in attendance (5 rows ahead of me).Not to give out any spoilers, because I won't...but this film rocked. Does it have a different feel than Night, Dawn, and Day? Of course it does...why? Because of the fact that it's 2005, and movie making has changed over the course of the years. And also, this wasn't an independent film in the same way the other three were.BUT, what they got away with, gore-wise, was absolutely incredible. My buddy and I were laughing with glee through the entire flick at all of the violence. Let me put all doubts to rest: This IS a George A Romero zombie film. This is NOT a rip-off...it's the real deal. Head shots, decapitations, zombie biting people with the typical fleshy ripping...intestines...the works. I was SHOCKED at the amount of gore they managed to get into the film. I spoke with the Production Manager after wards, and he assured me that the gore in the film is NOTHING compared to what's going to be on the DVD. Oh, and on the way out, I got to shake GAR's hand and tell him that this is an incredible film. Honestly, it's this generation's "Dawn". (And yes, that means it's more fast paced etc etc, which some purists might be ticked off about). And when I say this is this generation's "Dawn", I mean THIS is the zombie movie people will remember years from now. It totally blows the other recently released zombie flicks (including the Dawn remake) out of the water. The acting was excellent all around...and I mean all around. There were no bad performances. Even Dennis Hopper and John Leguizamo, who both were put down on the message board for being in the film, were amazing. Hell, even the zombies kicked ass.Anyway, that's all I'll say. You guys will either love it or hate it. I loved it.Final word: Watch for the priest zombie. You'll know what I mean when you see it...hilarious. And watch for the arm scene...a hand upheld in a foggy mist...you'll understand when you see that too. Also, watch for the hilarious departure of two of Dennis Hopper's assistants...his personal assistant and his butler. LOL funny.

It's so odd to read the reviews, they're either scathing or wonderful, such passion for such a movie. I'll be honest, I think it's just an average movie, I know it's fifteen years since the release date, but many movies become classics, and hold up very well. I would say this holds up moderately well.The story is decent, the special effects are decent, plenty of blood and gore. However, when I watch a zombie film I look for a little bit of originality, something unique in story, production, cast etc, that's the problem, there is nothing which sets this film apart, the previous films have much more of an impact, this one is a bit lacking somehow.It still packs a punch, it's still watchable, 6/10.

Another commenter on this movie mentioned the resident evil franchise and the remake of dawn of the dead. More titles come up if you look at this sub genre; 28 days later or Shaun of the dead for example. Not to mention the countless no budget but we have a great idea semi home video flicks that deal with the undead.When I saw the original George Romero series - night, dawn and day- I found it groundbreaking in your face smart horror.But times have progressed. The feeling I had after watching this film was the "is this it?!?"feeling. To start with the whole slow moving corpses thing doesn't cut it anymore for me, it gets boring surprisingly fast. The whole mad max beyond thunder dome feeling doesn't really work because it doesn't get enough attention.The whole story doesn't work because basically the epic feeling of doom the other parts had is gone, there isn't that much going on. The problem is that all these negative aspects are so visible the good things do not get a chance. The fact that the undead learn to think and the whole class based layout of the city for example. For me the pacing of the resident evils and the 28 days later film and the smartness of Shaun of the dead is dearly missed.Most times I watched while thinking that there was so much more interesting stuff to do with the material and the actors. The gore hounds can be satisfied though, you have your bites with a bitten out piercing to top it all and of course the mutilations in various forms ... but even that feels like an ingredient put in the blender. I can understand now why this one fell like a rock off the box office charts. Irony is that every horror fan has to see this only to get the same disappointed feeling I had.You can see times have changed if movies like resident evil feel like a better product than the film that was the start of it all.
