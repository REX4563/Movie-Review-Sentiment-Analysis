Role Models is directed by David Wain who also collectively writes the screenplay with Timothy Dowling, Paul Rudd and Ken Marino. It stars Paul Rudd, Sean William Scott, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bobbi'e J. Thompson, Elizabeth Banks and Jane Lynch. Music is by Craig Wedren and cinematography by Russ T. Alsobrook. Two energy drink salesmen (Rudd and Scott) are ordered to perform 150 hours of community service as punishment for an offence that occurred when their company vehicle was about to be towed. For their service, the two men work at a program called Sturdy Wings that is designed to pair kids with adult role models.Personally I avoided it until now because it just sounded like another lame American bawdy comedy about two slacker dudes who create chaos and then grow up by the end credits. This in spite of the fact that I rate Rudd highly and have often found Scott watchable in small doses. As it happens, the film follows the standard formula of plotting but rises above it with funny dialogue, a commitment to its characters and an avoidance of the sort of treacle thick sentimentality that is out of place in this type of comedy. It's also expertly performed by the cast, with the youngsters doing their shift admirably.Yep, there's adherence to poignancy and type, while the odd scene just comes off as being too smug and clever. But there's so much fun to be had here it doesn't hurt the film, it's a true pick me up if you are feeling down, a splendid case of a cast finding chemistry across the board and delivering on the promise of the zippy script. 8/10

I need to look into the plethora of comedies coming down the pipe for who wrote and directed them. I watched the trailer for Role Models and thought it looked funny enough. But it was Seann William Scottdon't get me wrong, he's pretty good, I just didn't have it high on my list, even though my boy Paul Rudd co-starred. So, here I was, months later and finally ready to take a peek, and the starting credits just made me excited for what was to follow. I had no idea that the crew behind "The State" were integral in the production, both writing and starring. Whether my memory of that show holds up to its actually enjoyment, I don't know, however, what they have been doing lately has been comic genius. Even in the more subtle collaborations like Diggers, the laughs were big and the comedy worthwhile. Thankfully, director David Wain and co-writer Ken Marino brought the star of that film over, Rudd, to help them once again. The guy is pure gold these days and even though this new film is pretty run-of-the-mill story-wise, the characters and antics are anything but.Two man-childs screw up on the job, (performing at school auditoriums to sell kids on an unhealthy energy drink to take the place of narcotics), by disrupting the peace, destroying property, and abusing a police officer. Rudd's Danny's girlfriend, who broke up with him just before the incident, is a lawyer and gets jail time reduced to community service for the Sturdy Wings organization, (got to admit I really like the logo for this made-up entity in the film). Danny and William Scott's Wheeler find themselves paired with the two toughest cases in the program: Augie Farks, a nerdy teen who entrenches himself in a live-action D&D world called LAIRE, and Ronnie Shields, a foul-mouthed grade schooler from a single mother home, acting out to push all those who try and reach him away. Assigned by Wings founder Gayle Sweeney, (the always memorable Jane Lynch in another gem of a role as an ex-drug addict prostitute who found her calling in "servicing" the children); they are set up to fail to be sent to the big house. While Wheeler begins to enjoy time with a child as crude as himself, Danny can't get out of his funk, a depression that continues to escalate, as he can't even bring himself to call his co-worker a friend  they just work together.The interactions with Augie and Ronnie, (Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Bobb'e J. Thompson respectively), are definitely the high points of a very funny film. I hate to say that McLovin' will forever be typecast as the loser geekhis nasally voice and gawky features don't help the factbut, for now, it's working for him. Wearing a cape and fighting grown men in costumes who speak old English, Augie is both embarrassing and endearing, showing a side of us all, that need to be unique and different, to escape the monotony of our horrible lives, no matter what cost to our own public image. As for Thompson's Ronnie, you won't get anything funnier. This kid is fantastic: cussing, slapping people in the face without warning, and bringing out the cute when necessary. I don't know whether to condemn or condone the parents of this boy, because he's definitely got something, I'm just not sure if it is morally right to let him have it. Both boys, though, fit right into the craziness of the movie, bringing out the inevitable discovery of Danny and Wheeler's need to dismantle their selfish selves, and adding fodder for and the creation of multiple laugh-out-loud moments.Supporting this foursome team is a lot of familiar faces, many who have worked with each other before. Lynch is a staple in this genre and joining her are a couple guys that have been cropping up lately too. Both Ken Jeong, (as the King of LAIRE), and Joe Lo Truglio, (a fellow countryman of Augie's), add some awkward brilliance to that thread of the story. You may remember both from bit parts in Pineapple Express  someone needs to get the Apatow gang and "The State" gang together for a film. As for members of that troupe, Ken Marino and Kerri Kenney have fun as Augie's parents, director David Wain himself tries to play the acoustic guitar, and even "UCB" alum Matt Walsh comes to join in the fun. Let's also not forget the beautiful Elizabeth Banks as Danny's love. She may not be integral to the humor, but she is the rock that his character works towards, and thus becomes a reason for some of the insane activities that occur.Yes, the kooky kids and their inclusion in the sordid ways of two screw-up adults would be funny anywhere, but add in the medieval wars, the teaching of an eleven year old on how to disguise his cleavage viewing, and the cryptic words spewing from Jane Lynch's mouth each time she's on screen, (along with her prize volunteer weirdo A.D. Miles), and you can't lose. References to pop culture are infused throughout, adding a level of relevance as well. We have Kiss entering the land of LAIRE, Rudd quoting every romantic film his character has seen, a gut-busting joke at Harry Potter's expense, and even a mention of Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra's own regular Marvin Hamlisch. Sure its obvious, sure its vulgar, (I did view the un-rated version), but there is enough heart and an abundance of quality laughs to make checking Role Models out a good move.

'Role Models' is a generic yet likable comedy with some genuinely funny individual scenes. As you would expect, this movie is thin in terms of plot, in fact I'm pretty sure we've seen virtually the same plot done several times before. That isn't to the film's detriment though as it does still produce some good laughs and I doubt originality would have been high on a list of priorities for viewers.If you're looking for some brainless, harmless fun to pass the time then 'Role Models' is an ideal choice. This movie is nothing special and it never tries to be, but it is effective as a comedy. It provides some decent laughs and, although it isn't consistently funny, it is a solid piece of entertainment overall. 'Role Models' is a just another silly, harmless comedy. Decent light entertainment but nothing more.

Role Models - Two energy drink spokesmen, Wheeler and Danny (Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd) get in trouble with the law after Danny has a break-up with his girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks who is in everything these days). They are given the choice of jail or community service with troubled kids, and choose the latter. Danny is given a boy Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of Superbad) who wears a cape and is into role-playing games. Wheeler is given a foul mouthed terror of a boy (Bobb'e J. Thompson).Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott have good chemistry. Rudd has dry sarcasm to spare and Scott plays a sex-addled numbskull. Their interactions with the two talented young boys are funny and occasionally sweet. Bobb'e J. Thompson is one of the better child actors of his age and makes the nightmare of every teacher a cool often wickedly funny little character. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, or "McLovin'" as he's known throughout America, plays essentially the same character but sweeter and shy and, funny enough, less creepy. So yeah, he's pretty firmly typecast as "dork" at this point. But he's a very palatable dork and may help raise the image of dorks everywhere above the status of subhuman. I heard many girls in the audience very sensitive to his plight in the audience.A few parts of the plot are contrived. But aside from a few film snobs, who goes to see a comedy for its original plot? The important thing is the laughs, and this is where the film delivers. Directed by David Wain, maker of The Ten (funny cult film), and written by Wain and Paul Rudd, this film is hilarious. The laughs were frequent and hearty. One of the films defining elements is the showcasing of role-playing games such as Dungeons&Dragons (here it is known as L.A.I.R.E). Role Models takes a surprisingly even handed look at it. It pokes fun, of course (so easy). But there is also respect ingrained. The result is a case of "so lame it's awesome" where the absurdity of D&D is given the gravitas of your average Hollywood blockbuster. It's hilarious, and does look terribly fun.And it's here that the film makes it's stand. Do what makes you happy, no matter what your parents or anyone else tells you. It's been said in so many films that the message seems false at this point. But in Role Model's extreme example of people doing what makes them happy, it really does ring true. You got to give a bunch of people playing with foam swords in the forest their due. They're doing what makes them happy. Can you say the same for yourself? I can't right now.This was a delightful film. It may be a bad year for movies, but it's a damn fine one for comedy. A-

For every twenty filthy disgusting R-rated comedy gems, there's one that stands out because of its heavy dosage of heart. Role Models isn't the sort of movie you'd expect to be the exception, but nonetheless delivers quality film-making, quality writing and acting, and plenty of life-lessons as well as raunchy humor to keep you laughing throughout. Paul Rudd's first script is full of his dry, sarcastic, witty brand of humor; and then we have the hilarious Seann William Scott in the sidekick role. Underneath the layers of profanity, sex jokes, cleavage lies life values and a hidden layer of sentimentality that seeps its way through the second and third acts. The transition is very slow and gradually actually improves the film as it rolls on.Role Models follows two slackers, a bitter one (Rudd) and a rowdy, horny freebird (William Scott) being forced to community service after a mishap outside a school. For their community service, they have to enroll in a big brother-like program and take care of a kid for 150 hours. The task becomes hard because one of them is a major fan of the fantasy, medieval role-playing lifestyle, and the other is a foul-mouthed, misbehaving youngling with no respect towards adults or people in general. As they spend more time together however, they realize they have a lot more in common than previously assumed; and suddenly start changing each other's habits for the better.The screenplay is helmed by four minds, with Paul Rudd providing his personal touch for the first time in his career. The payoff is magnificent, as the plot never dwells into formulaic, and most of the humor hits rather than misses. Unlike most modern rated-R comedies, some of the jokes are very low and come quickly, therefore passing by the viewer without getting a reaction. It takes some quick wit to nab the swiftly-delivered one-liners. Paul Rudd is perfectly cast as the lead character Danny, and performs with an overwhelming aura of selfishness, sarcasm, and subtle hostility. Seann William Scott is at his best when being second banana (See: American Pie, The Rundown) and is also perfectly cast as the wild, immature co-worker of Danny. Last but not least we must applaud Christopher Mintz-Plasse as he delivers another grand geeky performance that mixes humor with heart.What separates incredible rated-R comedies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and There's Something About Mary from stinkers like Scary Movie 2, Superbad, and My Best Friend's Girl is how much raunchy material is presented and its timing. In the first two films mentioned, there's squeamish and adult humor sprinkled throughout, but it's never overdone or overkilled. Role Models has a lot of profanity, a bit of sex, and a bit of crudeness attached; but these elements are never one-hundred percent focused on. Director David Wain knows how to keep the film from being unbearably crude and unwatchable by proving other ways to deliver laughs: whether it is with physical humor, snappy comebacks, and hilarious scenarios. The best bits are when Danny and Wheeler are having trouble adjusting to the behaviors of their "little brothers."But then the movie dwells into deeper territory by providing insight into the reason why the little brothers are such a hassle to handle; and why these kids can potentially help our two main characters. Themes about life, love, family, and understanding the next individual are all too present. Nobody's bizarre and unique mannerisms are ever left unexplained. By the end you've gotten to know the characters so well, you can figure out their next moves. It's a sort of predictability that's actually refreshing. Of course, then we are all thrown off by the climax, which stages one of the funniest moments in 2008 cinema. The epic finale is long, but ludicrous, and wraps up the story very nicely.Bottom Line: It usually isn't my nature to give a film with dozens of cleavage jokes a high score (especially with my hate affair with Dane Cook), but Role Models is surprisingly cute, surprisingly sweet, and delightfully hilarious and touching. You'll care for everyone by the third act, and will remain entertained until the very end. Unlike the average adult comedy, this one comes with a lot of values and adorable little moments that makes this worth watching more than once. Paul Rudd is a much underrated actor and entertainer, as we see him deliver on his first main comedic role. Here's to hoping we'll see much more of him in the near future. In the meantime, you'll do yourself some good by watching this gem."No, venti is twenty. Large is large. In fact, tall is large and grande is Spanish for large. Venti is the only one that doesn't mean large. It's also the only one that's Italian. Congratulations, you're stupid in three languages."

Rating-7/10Role Models is a funny comedy and well acted by a funny cast which mixes humour and a heart warming backing to create what I think is an underrated film. A solid kind of good film this is worth a watch and with laughter to match you whilst watching then it is even more advisable. Here below is why I think this film is a good one.The story as said is funny yet warm and although is mostly humour of which can be sometimes very crude(mostly from Seann William Scott), it is still warm also and the ending as you may see is really quite happy and tender. It is fast comedy and things start straight away as you will see, the story is very simple but it works well enough anyway and you should laugh if at least not once, just go with the flow and have fun is all you need to like it, trust me it can be good.Paul Rudd in his ever comedic role is good in the main role with previously mentioned William Scott providing comedic cover in the supporting if not not shared main role. I particularly found the young actor Bobb'e J. Thompson who plays an orphan child as very funny and plays a cursing young boy who acts like he is 30 years old and a player. Elizabeth Banks brings rationality to the film and is just about the only serious character but she doesn't do anything to ruin the humour, it works along well.The script is the main part of the good humour used in this and is partly written by Paul Rudd as well as some others who contribute and make the script possibly the best thing about this entire film. One point when the directing of David Wain comes in is when they play this pretend fight game and the entire shot must have been very difficult to direct as so much goes on, the scene itself is hilarious by the way, and+ the scene has some great costumes as does many parts of the film so look out for them.It isn't the most solid comedy and not every joke is funny to be fair, most are I think but when they are not funny they are sometime in between funny jokes and so you laugh and then think "what was that" in two seconds. The acting isn't awesome and although Paul Rudd is experienced at this with such showings in Anchorman, he is the best comedic performer by far, William Scott is funny too though.I think most people who enjoy slightly crude humour will enjoy this and some people will have big laughs. If you are looking for a way more sophisticated comedy then this isn't for you but the movie isn't all comedy as I said it has a warm hearted feeling running through it and by the end(you will see what I mean),you feel the comedy has worked well and it end's nicely.So overall a 7/10 from me a solidly good film and a comedy I couldn't tell you to watch more actually. I would say if you just watch this through and in comedy mode if that makes any sense, then you will laugh at this and find the script is very smartly done. Some will like, some will not and I expect a rather mixed review on this.

Just saw Role Models last night,and boy oh boy, could this have been the most over-rated movie on IMDb?? I am a bit of a fan of Sean William Scott,and he has changed his personality slightly after the American pie Movies like Dukes Of Hazzard. But after seeing this crap, I got the idea he wasn't putting in any effort, along with Paul Rudd who was "Mike" in Friends, whom I thought was hilarious in the show.Rudd basically plays a bit of a whiner, which I thought would have been funny if the movie had progressed properly with a bit of direction with his complaints, but no,he just remains the same throughout, in all honesty, he just wasn't funny at all, which was disappointing because I actually like the actor which was one of the main reasons for going to see this. I just wish he got a better script to work with There were a few laughs all in all, more on Sean William Scotts side, which was rare enough.2 Characters I could not stand in this movie was 1. The Ex Junkie Leader of "Sturdy Wings" who just completely overdid her lines, and just does not suit Comedy (weiner scene when shes in the convenience store with Sean William Scott)...I rest my case, NOT FUNNY. And whats with all her pointless lines about "Bu*******ng"?? i just don't get it. For an ex junkie, ALL she did was talk about drugs, and being funny about it, which was ridiculous. And 2. The black kid, Ronnie. Im not taking this movie on a serious personal level, but this kid just turned out to be a foul mouthed brat, and just did NOT strike me as being funny at all, all he did was curse and shout at people, I just couldn't laugh, all I could do was roll my eyes and shake my head yet again. Along with a lot of cursing, (mostly from the black kid, which was all he did) and the pointless nudity scenes with William Scott(were they trying to add American pie scenes into this to make it funny?), this movie could have been aimed towards kids.Like I said, a few laughs, not many. Its up to you if you want to pick this movie up, but don't expect much in my opinion...

Not a fault, just something I thought was happening. Easy 6 on the score card as it gets lots of good jokes in there. It's a shame the 1 pointers have decided to trash it rather than having a life.

I saw this movie at a free screening last night, and by the time the movie was over, I was hoarse because I laughed so much. And these weren't just little laughs, but big guffaws. The whole audience was laughing through the whole movie. The previews are funny, but this is one instance where they don't show the only funny parts of the movie in the previews. Paul Rudd is a great actor, in general, and he really shines in this movie. The movie is hysterical, raunchy, and touching. Kudos to Rudd, Wain, and Merino. I really hope that this movie gains a lot of ground through the great buzz it is currently getting. It deserves that buzz.

This movie definitely does not push any new boundaries in the film industry. Role Models uses sex and cursing to make a few cheap jokes running through most of the movie. Yet, it uses well-timed jokes to generate a few laughs here and there that made the movie worth watching if you do not get too offended at seeing some breasts or hearing the constant use of profanity. This type of movie is definitely well received in the culture of young people, and I am guessing it won't become old anytime soon with young moviegoers. The movie speaks to the need for adults to invest in the lives of hurting kids who are lacking the traditional family unit. Studies show that kids who have a relationship with a caring non-family member usually are healthier. Sean William Scott and Paul Rudd's characters are not your typical role models who kids necessarily should emulate. Yet, through the chaos of the movie the two characters actually make a positive impact in the lives of the students and their families. Part of me wants to say that only in the movie world could characters with lives as crazy as these actually be fit to be an actual role model. One could wonder at what point does somebody actually qualify to invest his or her life in others. Maybe, the first act of selflessness portrayed in the movie is the crossing line one can actually be a role model. Is it too crazy to think that any of us can let go of our self-absorption and invest time into others?

Anson Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny Donahue (Paul Rudd) are traveling promoters for an energy drink company. Wheeler is a slacker womanizer. Danny is devoted to lawyer Beth (Elizabeth Banks) and bitter that his life is going nowhere. In desperation, he asks her to marry him. Of course, she breaks up with him. Danny gets into a fight with a tow truck driver causing damage to the school. Beth gets them community service and they become big brothers to Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who's obsessed with Live-Action-Interactive-Role playing-Explorers (basically LARP) and foul-mouthed Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson). Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch) runs the program.Paul Rudd is a great grump and gets in some good rants. Seann William Scott is doing his usual womanizing slacker. Mintz-Plasse is touching as the LARP nerd. He has a sweet relationship with Rudd. There is something funny about a foul-mouthed little kid. There are a lot of inappropriate laughs and there's a sweet feel-good movie at its center.

The capsule summary of "Role Models" on Xfinity TV is, "Forced to join a mentorship program, two irresponsible men (Seann William Scott, Paul Rudd) must help a pair of impressionable boys navigate the troubled waters of youth." That description sounds like a smarmy physical comedy derivative with cheap scatological bits. Except that Xfinity gave it a rating of 3 out of 4 stars, so I decided to take a look at it.To my pleasure, the film turned out to be a much more sophisticated movie. The two men, who are allowed to do community service instead of jail, are assigned to a big brother type program. The more intellectual of the two men, Danny, who is disillusioned with the world, is assigned to an immature teen who doesn't fit in with his peers; instead he devotes himself to participation in an on-going Dungeons and Dragons type reenactment played by a mixed group of adults and children who and his job. Wheeler, a care-free womanizer, is assigned a tough young foul-mouthed kid with whom no previous volunteer had lasted more than one day. The story shows the changes the interactions of the two "Littles" and their "Bigs"have on each other. There are a number of cheap double entendre sexual references, but they don't diminish the film too much.

While I had never seen any of David Wain's previous films, the star power was enough to catch my attention for this comedy. I'm quickly finding myself as a major fan of Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott has never let me down. Here we have a flick that brings the two together in a comedy that, while it isn't the best I've seen, still manages to keep me laughing. The story follows Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) as two representatives for an energy drink company who are placed into community service to avoid jail time. As punishment, the two are forced into a Big Brother style program and are each assigned a kid for a month.I found that I wasn't overly impressed with this movie when I first watched it but it's grown on me each time since. The jokes are hit-or-miss but most of them are good for a laugh. Paul Rudd continues to flaunt his awesome line delivery and improv skills, and Scott does an ample job keeping up. Of course, some of the film's funniest moments are courtesy of the younger stars, Bobb'e J. Thompson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Thompson is like a mini-Chris Rock, vulgar with great comedic timing. Mintz-Plasse plays up the same nerd angle he did in Greg Mottola's SUPERBAD though now with an obsession for LAIRE (a live-action sword/dungeons role-playing game).The movie is funny but it's doesn't quite live up to the comedic gems we've been receiving from Judd Apatow and his crew in recent years. Some of the jokes fall flat, others muster a chuckle, but some are spot on (especially Jane Lynch, who boosts the laughs as the ex-cokehead running the program) and I still get a kick out of the film's LAIRE finale. The performances were great and a stronger script could've amped this film up a couple levels; if I'm not mistaken, the production had a few hiccups and rewrites. All-in-all, the humor outweighs the dull enough to keep this movie entertaining and worth a viewing.

I have to write this review because I can't believe this film is rated as high as 7! Two offenders sentenced on 150 hours community work. And guess what, their job is to be role models for kids... Unreal. The story is just unbearable. 80% of the film is centred around role play battles and kid who is stuck in his own fairy tale bubble life. I just couldn't make myself believe in to this poor story line. Boring as hell. Yes, the characters are dumb geeks and sometimes funny but hello...? Like I've said- majority of the film is just painful too watch. Try to look out for better comedy. This is pure waste of time. The lady who runs the organisation called Sturdy Wings in the film is deeply annoying with her acting skills.

After seeing the trailer for Role Models, I thought it looked like a funny movie, but I wasn't expecting much, I was thinking they might have just shown the great parts in the trailer and that would be it. But I took the opportunity and saw Role Models the other day and I have to say this is completely opposite from what I was expecting, first off I was worried that there was going to be a lot of gross humor and the kids might be more annoying than funny, but it turn out that this was one of the funniest movies I have seen this year. I just couldn't stop laughing throughout this film, who knew that Sean William Scott could actually be really funny? I know there are a lot of Stiffler fans that will hate that sentence, but I don't remember a time that I laughed so hard at his character. He and Paul Rudd both worked so well together and were terrific on screen, this was the last duo on Earth that I expected such great laughs from.Wheeler and Danny both work for an energy drink company, but after a very hard day for Danny he crashes their company truck on school property, but his ex-girlfriend, Beth, who is a lawyer is able to get them just 150 hours community service with two kids, one is a total dungeons and dragons nerd and the other is just a pain in the butt. You know how the story goes, Danny learns how to be happy and Wheeler finally grows up into a more father figure role.Now the story is something we have seen a million times before, but it's still a great comedy. Jane Lynch who is becoming one of my favorite comedic actresses, you've also seen her in 40 year old virgin, she is just absolutely hilarious in this movie and has all the best lines "You know what I ate for breakfast? Cocaine. You know what I ate for lunch? Cocaine..." she is such a great and fun actress to watch on screen. I really loved Role Models, it turned out to be a great comedy and was an absolute blast to watch. I highly recommend if you get the chance to see it, take it, it's a guaranteed laugh.8/10

Danny is in a rut with his life and hates his job as a promoter of a sugar/caffeine energy drink called minotaur, while his co-worker, Wheeler, loves it. However after being dumped by his girlfriend, Danny crashes his minotaur truck into a school monument and he and Wheeler face the prospect of 30 days in jail or 150 hours of community service doing big-brother type work with disadvantaged youngsters. While Wheeler is landed with Ronny an obnoxious little 10 year old, Danny is landed with a dungeons and dragon playing geek called Augie. While neither of them hit it off with the kids at first they all eventually become friends and learn a lot of life lessons. Ahhhh! Now, you might think that from this semi-sarcastic tone I hated it, but oh contraire, far from. I admit I had low expectations of this film that were completely smashed by the scatter-gun humour of the film. The dialogue is funny and the sarcasm bitingly funny at times, as the top line suggests. Paul Rudd is perfect as the miserable Danny and Sean William Scott is perfectly cast as the free-living, but unfortunate Wheeler.The film manages to tread that fine line between cliché ridden schmaltz (Like 27 dresses) and refreshingly enjoyable comedies (Like Something About Mary) with a deft touch, the direction is sure footed and manages to deliver a surprise ending that I would never have guessed from how it began.A laugh out loud comedy that exceeds expectations.

Danny (Paul Rudd) has a bad day on the job and drags his loyal but dim-witted buddy Wheeler (Sean William Scott) down with him. Danny is a 'Red Bull' style energy drink spokesman, Wheeler is the guy in the bull suit that jumps around beside him. In the same 24 hours Danny loses his girlfriend, license and job.In reality he starts by losing the girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks), and his subsequent tantrum and stupidity sees him lose both license and job and sees him teetering on the verge of imprisonment. Somehow guilt by association sees Wheeler in the same predicament.To avoid jail Beth – who happens to be a lawyer = lucky – wrangles community service instead. Service in the form of helping disadvantaged and troubled kids for a company named 'Sturdy Wings'.This shakiest of premises: allowing unreliable young men to mentor impressionable young boys, sets the scene for the slap dash stuff that follows. Miraculously enough though the threadbare premise is held together by enough jokes and amusing moments to make the thing worthwhile, largely due to the continued comedic stylings of one Paul Rudd, and the strength of the various supporting bit parts on display throughout.When allotted their respective 'littles' (Danny and Wheeler are 'bigs') by Sturdy Wings boss and recovering alcoholic Sweeney (Jane Lynch) we immediately see where this is going.Danny considers himself 'normal', but in reality he is so concerned with not being deemed 'uncool' that his disdain for cliché and obvious statements leaves everyone else bored by his constant judgment. He scores 16ish Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a medieval-style role player who is intensely insecure when not in character, and intensely-intense when he is.Wheeler on the other hand wants no part of responsibility of any kind. He is more than happy being the jumping around sidekick in the costume and has no thought for his own future. For now he is all about the well let's just say boobies (and everything below). Of course he is allocated troubled young 8ish Ronnie, a profane little sh*t-stirrer who wants nothing more than to not have to deal with adults.Each kid has parental issues – but ones that don't kill the potential laughs – no abuse here, and the guys must get through to the children in their own way, and sucks; maybe learn a little about themselves on the way What develops is a rom-com with all the associated hijinks, temporary fall-outs and hitches, only between an adult male and a kid/youth, but that's not where the laughs are born.Role Models works best in the smaller roles, the now renowned Ken Jeong keeps his pants on this time and plays the King of the role playing game L.A.I.R.E., surrounded by his toadying minions and remaining in character even away from the game in his kingdom at the local cafe. Jane Lynch is a little OTT with the attempted mind games as the Sturdy Wings boss, but she also gets a few of the best lines in the flick, and there are numerous other bit roles – each with a couple jokes – filled by character actors that'll have you remembering them from other bit roles in other flicks.The jokes are thrown about quick and fast, and while some don't work enough do to make Role Models a lot like I Love You, Man and Knocked Up, lightweight and amusing enough to justify your time, with occasional genuine humour (and unexpected nudity!).Final Rating – 6 / 10. I can see the future. When I watched this 4 days ago I knew myself well enough that I wrote "It really is a 6" next to the rating. You might not recall Role Models as such a cracking laugh weeks after the viewing, but while you are watching it is a good time.

I need to look into the plethora of comedies coming down the pipe for who wrote and directed them. I watched the trailer for Role Models and thought it looked funny enough. But it was Seann William Scottdon't get me wrong, he's pretty good, I just didn't have it high on my list, even though my boy Paul Rudd co-starred. So, here I was, months later and finally ready to take a peek, and the starting credits just made me excited for what was to follow. I had no idea that the crew behind "The State" were integral in the production, both writing and starring. Whether my memory of that show holds up to its actually enjoyment, I don't know, however, what they have been doing lately has been comic genius. Even in the more subtle collaborations like Diggers, the laughs were big and the comedy worthwhile. Thankfully, director David Wain and co-writer Ken Marino brought the star of that film over, Rudd, to help them once again. The guy is pure gold these days and even though this new film is pretty run-of-the-mill story-wise, the characters and antics are anything but.Two man-childs screw up on the job, (performing at school auditoriums to sell kids on an unhealthy energy drink to take the place of narcotics), by disrupting the peace, destroying property, and abusing a police officer. Rudd's Danny's girlfriend, who broke up with him just before the incident, is a lawyer and gets jail time reduced to community service for the Sturdy Wings organization, (got to admit I really like the logo for this made-up entity in the film). Danny and William Scott's Wheeler find themselves paired with the two toughest cases in the program: Augie Farks, a nerdy teen who entrenches himself in a live-action D&D world called LAIRE, and Ronnie Shields, a foul-mouthed grade schooler from a single mother home, acting out to push all those who try and reach him away. Assigned by Wings founder Gayle Sweeney, (the always memorable Jane Lynch in another gem of a role as an ex-drug addict prostitute who found her calling in "servicing" the children); they are set up to fail to be sent to the big house. While Wheeler begins to enjoy time with a child as crude as himself, Danny can't get out of his funk, a depression that continues to escalate, as he can't even bring himself to call his co-worker a friend  they just work together.The interactions with Augie and Ronnie, (Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Bobb'e J. Thompson respectively), are definitely the high points of a very funny film. I hate to say that McLovin' will forever be typecast as the loser geekhis nasally voice and gawky features don't help the factbut, for now, it's working for him. Wearing a cape and fighting grown men in costumes who speak old English, Augie is both embarrassing and endearing, showing a side of us all, that need to be unique and different, to escape the monotony of our horrible lives, no matter what cost to our own public image. As for Thompson's Ronnie, you won't get anything funnier. This kid is fantastic: cussing, slapping people in the face without warning, and bringing out the cute when necessary. I don't know whether to condemn or condone the parents of this boy, because he's definitely got something, I'm just not sure if it is morally right to let him have it. Both boys, though, fit right into the craziness of the movie, bringing out the inevitable discovery of Danny and Wheeler's need to dismantle their selfish selves, and adding fodder for and the creation of multiple laugh-out-loud moments.Supporting this foursome team is a lot of familiar faces, many who have worked with each other before. Lynch is a staple in this genre and joining her are a couple guys that have been cropping up lately too. Both Ken Jeong, (as the King of LAIRE), and Joe Lo Truglio, (a fellow countryman of Augie's), add some awkward brilliance to that thread of the story. You may remember both from bit parts in Pineapple Express  someone needs to get the Apatow gang and "The State" gang together for a film. As for members of that troupe, Ken Marino and Kerri Kenney have fun as Augie's parents, director David Wain himself tries to play the acoustic guitar, and even "UCB" alum Matt Walsh comes to join in the fun. Let's also not forget the beautiful Elizabeth Banks as Danny's love. She may not be integral to the humor, but she is the rock that his character works towards, and thus becomes a reason for some of the insane activities that occur.Yes, the kooky kids and their inclusion in the sordid ways of two screw-up adults would be funny anywhere, but add in the medieval wars, the teaching of an eleven year old on how to disguise his cleavage viewing, and the cryptic words spewing from Jane Lynch's mouth each time she's on screen, (along with her prize volunteer weirdo A.D. Miles), and you can't lose. References to pop culture are infused throughout, adding a level of relevance as well. We have Kiss entering the land of LAIRE, Rudd quoting every romantic film his character has seen, a gut-busting joke at Harry Potter's expense, and even a mention of Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra's own regular Marvin Hamlisch. Sure its obvious, sure its vulgar, (I did view the un-rated version), but there is enough heart and an abundance of quality laughs to make checking Role Models out a good move.

'Role Models' is a generic yet likable comedy with some genuinely funny individual scenes. As you would expect, this movie is thin in terms of plot, in fact I'm pretty sure we've seen virtually the same plot done several times before. That isn't to the film's detriment though as it does still produce some good laughs and I doubt originality would have been high on a list of priorities for viewers.If you're looking for some brainless, harmless fun to pass the time then 'Role Models' is an ideal choice. This movie is nothing special and it never tries to be, but it is effective as a comedy. It provides some decent laughs and, although it isn't consistently funny, it is a solid piece of entertainment overall. 'Role Models' is a just another silly, harmless comedy. Decent light entertainment but nothing more.

Role Models - Two energy drink spokesmen, Wheeler and Danny (Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd) get in trouble with the law after Danny has a break-up with his girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks who is in everything these days). They are given the choice of jail or community service with troubled kids, and choose the latter. Danny is given a boy Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of Superbad) who wears a cape and is into role-playing games. Wheeler is given a foul mouthed terror of a boy (Bobb'e J. Thompson).Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott have good chemistry. Rudd has dry sarcasm to spare and Scott plays a sex-addled numbskull. Their interactions with the two talented young boys are funny and occasionally sweet. Bobb'e J. Thompson is one of the better child actors of his age and makes the nightmare of every teacher a cool often wickedly funny little character. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, or "McLovin'" as he's known throughout America, plays essentially the same character but sweeter and shy and, funny enough, less creepy. So yeah, he's pretty firmly typecast as "dork" at this point. But he's a very palatable dork and may help raise the image of dorks everywhere above the status of subhuman. I heard many girls in the audience very sensitive to his plight in the audience.A few parts of the plot are contrived. But aside from a few film snobs, who goes to see a comedy for its original plot? The important thing is the laughs, and this is where the film delivers. Directed by David Wain, maker of The Ten (funny cult film), and written by Wain and Paul Rudd, this film is hilarious. The laughs were frequent and hearty. One of the films defining elements is the showcasing of role-playing games such as Dungeons&Dragons (here it is known as L.A.I.R.E). Role Models takes a surprisingly even handed look at it. It pokes fun, of course (so easy). But there is also respect ingrained. The result is a case of "so lame it's awesome" where the absurdity of D&D is given the gravitas of your average Hollywood blockbuster. It's hilarious, and does look terribly fun.And it's here that the film makes it's stand. Do what makes you happy, no matter what your parents or anyone else tells you. It's been said in so many films that the message seems false at this point. But in Role Model's extreme example of people doing what makes them happy, it really does ring true. You got to give a bunch of people playing with foam swords in the forest their due. They're doing what makes them happy. Can you say the same for yourself? I can't right now.This was a delightful film. It may be a bad year for movies, but it's a damn fine one for comedy. A-

I saw bits and pieces and maybe a trailer for this film, I didn't really think much of it at the time, I thought it might be terrible, but then I saw positive reviews and was instantly turned to see it. Basically Anson Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny Donahue (Paul Rudd, also writing) are friends in their early thirties that have a pretty dead end job promoting the energy drink Minotaur and encouraging kids to stay off drugs. They get into a big fight and they could face either thirty days in jail or perform 150 hours of community service, they opt for the community service in which they are assigned to be a big brother program called Sturdy Wings. Recovering drug addict manager Sweeny (Jane Lynch) is the one who has to keep an eye of them and make sure that they log the time they spend with the children until they have completed the hours. Danny is paired up with August 'Augie' Farcques (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who is a geeky teenager obsessed with playing medieval role play games like they are real, and Wheeler is paired up with Ronnie Shields (Bobb'e J. Thompson) the little foul mouthed streetwise black kid obsessed with boobs. Danny can't be on the level with Augie, and Wheeler cannot get Robbie to pay interest in anything, they think about the jail option, but they do gradually bond with their "littles", Ronnie taking interest in Wheeler's love for the rock bank Kiss and equally boobs, and Danny joins in with the medieval role play. Their success with the young ones goes downhill though when Danny and the role play with King Argotron (The Hangover's Ken Jeong) of "LAIRE" gets out of hand, and Wheeler forgets about Ronnie at a boozy party. They are removed from the Sturdy Wings program and will presumably go to jail, but Danny's girlfriend Beth Jones (Slither's Elizabeth Banks) says she will defend them in court, but they find a way to make up for their mistakes. Danny convinces King Argotron to allow him and Augie to take part in the big afternoon Battle Royale fight in the afternoon to "capture the kingdom of Xanthia", and with Wheeler and Ronnie joining they all dress as the four members of Kiss, and even though friend Sarah (Michelle Lenhardt) wins it all ends well. In the end Wheeler and Danny are forgiven by Sweeny seeing them take care of the children and their community service is complete. Also starring Ken Marino as Jim Stansel, Kerri Kenney-Silver as Lynette and A.D. Miles as Martin. Scott as always is great as the slacker like booby loving "adult", Rudd is also good as his friend, and the two kids Mintz-Plasse and especially Thompson are good fun, there are the small moments of slapstick and plenty of dialogue based jokes, it is an enjoyable comedy. Very good!

For every twenty filthy disgusting R-rated comedy gems, there's one that stands out because of its heavy dosage of heart. Role Models isn't the sort of movie you'd expect to be the exception, but nonetheless delivers quality film-making, quality writing and acting, and plenty of life-lessons as well as raunchy humor to keep you laughing throughout. Paul Rudd's first script is full of his dry, sarcastic, witty brand of humor; and then we have the hilarious Seann William Scott in the sidekick role. Underneath the layers of profanity, sex jokes, cleavage lies life values and a hidden layer of sentimentality that seeps its way through the second and third acts. The transition is very slow and gradually actually improves the film as it rolls on.Role Models follows two slackers, a bitter one (Rudd) and a rowdy, horny freebird (William Scott) being forced to community service after a mishap outside a school. For their community service, they have to enroll in a big brother-like program and take care of a kid for 150 hours. The task becomes hard because one of them is a major fan of the fantasy, medieval role-playing lifestyle, and the other is a foul-mouthed, misbehaving youngling with no respect towards adults or people in general. As they spend more time together however, they realize they have a lot more in common than previously assumed; and suddenly start changing each other's habits for the better.The screenplay is helmed by four minds, with Paul Rudd providing his personal touch for the first time in his career. The payoff is magnificent, as the plot never dwells into formulaic, and most of the humor hits rather than misses. Unlike most modern rated-R comedies, some of the jokes are very low and come quickly, therefore passing by the viewer without getting a reaction. It takes some quick wit to nab the swiftly-delivered one-liners. Paul Rudd is perfectly cast as the lead character Danny, and performs with an overwhelming aura of selfishness, sarcasm, and subtle hostility. Seann William Scott is at his best when being second banana (See: American Pie, The Rundown) and is also perfectly cast as the wild, immature co-worker of Danny. Last but not least we must applaud Christopher Mintz-Plasse as he delivers another grand geeky performance that mixes humor with heart.What separates incredible rated-R comedies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and There's Something About Mary from stinkers like Scary Movie 2, Superbad, and My Best Friend's Girl is how much raunchy material is presented and its timing. In the first two films mentioned, there's squeamish and adult humor sprinkled throughout, but it's never overdone or overkilled. Role Models has a lot of profanity, a bit of sex, and a bit of crudeness attached; but these elements are never one-hundred percent focused on. Director David Wain knows how to keep the film from being unbearably crude and unwatchable by proving other ways to deliver laughs: whether it is with physical humor, snappy comebacks, and hilarious scenarios. The best bits are when Danny and Wheeler are having trouble adjusting to the behaviors of their "little brothers."But then the movie dwells into deeper territory by providing insight into the reason why the little brothers are such a hassle to handle; and why these kids can potentially help our two main characters. Themes about life, love, family, and understanding the next individual are all too present. Nobody's bizarre and unique mannerisms are ever left unexplained. By the end you've gotten to know the characters so well, you can figure out their next moves. It's a sort of predictability that's actually refreshing. Of course, then we are all thrown off by the climax, which stages one of the funniest moments in 2008 cinema. The epic finale is long, but ludicrous, and wraps up the story very nicely.Bottom Line: It usually isn't my nature to give a film with dozens of cleavage jokes a high score (especially with my hate affair with Dane Cook), but Role Models is surprisingly cute, surprisingly sweet, and delightfully hilarious and touching. You'll care for everyone by the third act, and will remain entertained until the very end. Unlike the average adult comedy, this one comes with a lot of values and adorable little moments that makes this worth watching more than once. Paul Rudd is a much underrated actor and entertainer, as we see him deliver on his first main comedic role. Here's to hoping we'll see much more of him in the near future. In the meantime, you'll do yourself some good by watching this gem."No, venti is twenty. Large is large. In fact, tall is large and grande is Spanish for large. Venti is the only one that doesn't mean large. It's also the only one that's Italian. Congratulations, you're stupid in three languages."

Role Models is certainly something Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott never 
aspired to be. These two have a gig going around to various schools, Scott in
the costume of the legendary Greek mythological creature the Minotaur and
Rudd delivering an anti-drug pitch to our middle schoolers with some energy
drink called the Minotaur which is liquid sugar. Creating a diabetic crisis for the
following generation to deal with.After a presentation that lays an ostrich egg these two get into an altercation
with a tow truck operator it's jail or community service with a big brother type
program run by Jane Lynch.Rudd gets to bond with Christopher Mintz-Plasse a nerdy kid who is into live
action Mazes&Monsters type role play and Scott draws Bobbie J. Thompson a
kid with a sewer mouth that repels everyone else.The film is the story of how it works out for both men and the surrogate little
brothers they've drawn. All coming nicely together in a very funny in a park
where both men and young Thompson get into Mintz-Plasse's live action
medieval tournament.Rudd and Scott really get into their characters or maybe I should say they
build a bit of character in themselves and their charges. It's a nice comedy brought off well by a fine cast.

Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott are two very funny comedic actors. They prove what great chemistry they have together. Rudd and Scott star as Danny and Wheeler, two ne'er-do-wells who are sentenced to do community service. They have to serve in a Big-Brother-type program called Sturdy Wings for a total of 150 hours. Danny and Wheeler have opposite attitudes, yet they get along like they have been best friends for years. Jane Lynch (The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Talladega Nights) steals the show as the supervisor of the program that Danny and Wheeler are enrolled in. Elizabeth Banks gives a good supporting turn as Danny's girlfriend and lawyer. Another show stealer is Bobb'e J. Thompson as Ronnie, the kid Wheeler has to be a big brother to. Thompson is given some of the funniest lines and he is believable in this role.

Rating-7/10Role Models is a funny comedy and well acted by a funny cast which mixes humour and a heart warming backing to create what I think is an underrated film. A solid kind of good film this is worth a watch and with laughter to match you whilst watching then it is even more advisable. Here below is why I think this film is a good one.The story as said is funny yet warm and although is mostly humour of which can be sometimes very crude(mostly from Seann William Scott), it is still warm also and the ending as you may see is really quite happy and tender. It is fast comedy and things start straight away as you will see, the story is very simple but it works well enough anyway and you should laugh if at least not once, just go with the flow and have fun is all you need to like it, trust me it can be good.Paul Rudd in his ever comedic role is good in the main role with previously mentioned William Scott providing comedic cover in the supporting if not not shared main role. I particularly found the young actor Bobb'e J. Thompson who plays an orphan child as very funny and plays a cursing young boy who acts like he is 30 years old and a player. Elizabeth Banks brings rationality to the film and is just about the only serious character but she doesn't do anything to ruin the humour, it works along well.The script is the main part of the good humour used in this and is partly written by Paul Rudd as well as some others who contribute and make the script possibly the best thing about this entire film. One point when the directing of David Wain comes in is when they play this pretend fight game and the entire shot must have been very difficult to direct as so much goes on, the scene itself is hilarious by the way, and+ the scene has some great costumes as does many parts of the film so look out for them.It isn't the most solid comedy and not every joke is funny to be fair, most are I think but when they are not funny they are sometime in between funny jokes and so you laugh and then think "what was that" in two seconds. The acting isn't awesome and although Paul Rudd is experienced at this with such showings in Anchorman, he is the best comedic performer by far, William Scott is funny too though.I think most people who enjoy slightly crude humour will enjoy this and some people will have big laughs. If you are looking for a way more sophisticated comedy then this isn't for you but the movie isn't all comedy as I said it has a warm hearted feeling running through it and by the end(you will see what I mean),you feel the comedy has worked well and it end's nicely.So overall a 7/10 from me a solidly good film and a comedy I couldn't tell you to watch more actually. I would say if you just watch this through and in comedy mode if that makes any sense, then you will laugh at this and find the script is very smartly done. Some will like, some will not and I expect a rather mixed review on this.

Just saw Role Models last night,and boy oh boy, could this have been the most over-rated movie on IMDb?? I am a bit of a fan of Sean William Scott,and he has changed his personality slightly after the American pie Movies like Dukes Of Hazzard. But after seeing this crap, I got the idea he wasn't putting in any effort, along with Paul Rudd who was "Mike" in Friends, whom I thought was hilarious in the show.Rudd basically plays a bit of a whiner, which I thought would have been funny if the movie had progressed properly with a bit of direction with his complaints, but no,he just remains the same throughout, in all honesty, he just wasn't funny at all, which was disappointing because I actually like the actor which was one of the main reasons for going to see this. I just wish he got a better script to work with There were a few laughs all in all, more on Sean William Scotts side, which was rare enough.2 Characters I could not stand in this movie was 1. The Ex Junkie Leader of "Sturdy Wings" who just completely overdid her lines, and just does not suit Comedy (weiner scene when shes in the convenience store with Sean William Scott)...I rest my case, NOT FUNNY. And whats with all her pointless lines about "Bu*******ng"?? i just don't get it. For an ex junkie, ALL she did was talk about drugs, and being funny about it, which was ridiculous. And 2. The black kid, Ronnie. Im not taking this movie on a serious personal level, but this kid just turned out to be a foul mouthed brat, and just did NOT strike me as being funny at all, all he did was curse and shout at people, I just couldn't laugh, all I could do was roll my eyes and shake my head yet again. Along with a lot of cursing, (mostly from the black kid, which was all he did) and the pointless nudity scenes with William Scott(were they trying to add American pie scenes into this to make it funny?), this movie could have been aimed towards kids.Like I said, a few laughs, not many. Its up to you if you want to pick this movie up, but don't expect much in my opinion...

Role Models is a funny film with great dialog this is one of those films that doesn't rely on psychical comedy to carry it. So the movie is about these two guys Danny and Wheeler who are sentenced to community service and what they have to do is be big brothers to these two kids that they cannot stand.The strong points in the movie are the sarcastic lines that Paul Rudd gives and the antics Bobb'e J. Thompson will do, and how crazy Jane Lynch is besides that no one else is funny really at all. Comedy wise this movie will hit and miss and when it misses it really misses with the poop jokes they do or mindless swearing the movie is just lame but the sarcasm and weirdness characters bring will have you laughing.The plot is pretty predictable it is just a buddy comedy but I will hand it to them this movie makes LARP look pretty cool. What I do enjoy is that they don't hold over Paul Rudd romance side plot too much in the story they stick by the guys trying to get along with these kids.This is directed by David Wain he hasn't directed notable stuff but he has directed episodes of Children's Hospitol, which is a pretty funny show.Overall this is a funny comedy not the best but worth a watch I say a solid rental.

Not a fault, just something I thought was happening. Easy 6 on the score card as it gets lots of good jokes in there. It's a shame the 1 pointers have decided to trash it rather than having a life.

I have to admit I had not heard of this movie until a few months ago. I don't recall hearing about it when it came out a couple years ago but, wow, did I miss out! This movie is HILARIOUS! Edgy in that you don't expect kids to be offering the kind of adult humor they do in this film, especially like what's offered up by Tracy Morgan's son. (Wow, the vulgarity!) But for some reason this movie pulls it off, even as you shift in your seat a little wondering what kind of parents would allow their kid to use that kind of language even for a movie, lol. Even beyond the humor, the more serious overtones or messaging in the plot is welcomed and somehow fits, as in Augie's character coming into his own and being validated in his uniqueness, showing much more maturity than expected. Love it! Love what the writers did with that plot line.So quirky and weird and yet so relatable is this movie. You go from looking "at" grown men play-fighting like soldiers in a war to rooting for them and entering into that wacky world right alongside them. lol The subplots and the superb supporting cast round out the film and make it one of the most pleasant movie-watching surprises I've encountered in a long time.7.5

This movie definitely does not push any new boundaries in the film industry. Role Models uses sex and cursing to make a few cheap jokes running through most of the movie. Yet, it uses well-timed jokes to generate a few laughs here and there that made the movie worth watching if you do not get too offended at seeing some breasts or hearing the constant use of profanity. This type of movie is definitely well received in the culture of young people, and I am guessing it won't become old anytime soon with young moviegoers. The movie speaks to the need for adults to invest in the lives of hurting kids who are lacking the traditional family unit. Studies show that kids who have a relationship with a caring non-family member usually are healthier. Sean William Scott and Paul Rudd's characters are not your typical role models who kids necessarily should emulate. Yet, through the chaos of the movie the two characters actually make a positive impact in the lives of the students and their families. Part of me wants to say that only in the movie world could characters with lives as crazy as these actually be fit to be an actual role model. One could wonder at what point does somebody actually qualify to invest his or her life in others. Maybe, the first act of selflessness portrayed in the movie is the crossing line one can actually be a role model. Is it too crazy to think that any of us can let go of our self-absorption and invest time into others?

I saw this movie at a free screening last night, and by the time the movie was over, I was hoarse because I laughed so much. And these weren't just little laughs, but big guffaws. The whole audience was laughing through the whole movie. The previews are funny, but this is one instance where they don't show the only funny parts of the movie in the previews. Paul Rudd is a great actor, in general, and he really shines in this movie. The movie is hysterical, raunchy, and touching. Kudos to Rudd, Wain, and Merino. I really hope that this movie gains a lot of ground through the great buzz it is currently getting. It deserves that buzz.

Was way better than I thought it was going to be. I usual expect most American comedies to have the usual plot line and this one sounded no different. Some good work from the dependable Paul Rudd, Sean Willam Scott and especially (McLovin) Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Bobb'e J. Thompson who make it into a pretty decent comedy. After going off the rails in a boring job, the two adults are given the chance to avoid jail by mentoring some difficult kids in the community. The results and ending are rarely ever in doubt so there is not much in the way of spontaneous laughter, but in general its not quite as bad a film as some might make out, certainly worth a watch, just not a list topper.

Anson Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny Donahue (Paul Rudd) are traveling promoters for an energy drink company. Wheeler is a slacker womanizer. Danny is devoted to lawyer Beth (Elizabeth Banks) and bitter that his life is going nowhere. In desperation, he asks her to marry him. Of course, she breaks up with him. Danny gets into a fight with a tow truck driver causing damage to the school. Beth gets them community service and they become big brothers to Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who's obsessed with Live-Action-Interactive-Role playing-Explorers (basically LARP) and foul-mouthed Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson). Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch) runs the program.Paul Rudd is a great grump and gets in some good rants. Seann William Scott is doing his usual womanizing slacker. Mintz-Plasse is touching as the LARP nerd. He has a sweet relationship with Rudd. There is something funny about a foul-mouthed little kid. There are a lot of inappropriate laughs and there's a sweet feel-good movie at its center.

While I had never seen any of David Wain's previous films, the star power was enough to catch my attention for this comedy. I'm quickly finding myself as a major fan of Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott has never let me down. Here we have a flick that brings the two together in a comedy that, while it isn't the best I've seen, still manages to keep me laughing. The story follows Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) as two representatives for an energy drink company who are placed into community service to avoid jail time. As punishment, the two are forced into a Big Brother style program and are each assigned a kid for a month.I found that I wasn't overly impressed with this movie when I first watched it but it's grown on me each time since. The jokes are hit-or-miss but most of them are good for a laugh. Paul Rudd continues to flaunt his awesome line delivery and improv skills, and Scott does an ample job keeping up. Of course, some of the film's funniest moments are courtesy of the younger stars, Bobb'e J. Thompson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Thompson is like a mini-Chris Rock, vulgar with great comedic timing. Mintz-Plasse plays up the same nerd angle he did in Greg Mottola's SUPERBAD though now with an obsession for LAIRE (a live-action sword/dungeons role-playing game).The movie is funny but it's doesn't quite live up to the comedic gems we've been receiving from Judd Apatow and his crew in recent years. Some of the jokes fall flat, others muster a chuckle, but some are spot on (especially Jane Lynch, who boosts the laughs as the ex-cokehead running the program) and I still get a kick out of the film's LAIRE finale. The performances were great and a stronger script could've amped this film up a couple levels; if I'm not mistaken, the production had a few hiccups and rewrites. All-in-all, the humor outweighs the dull enough to keep this movie entertaining and worth a viewing.

The capsule summary of "Role Models" on Xfinity TV is, "Forced to join a mentorship program, two irresponsible men (Seann William Scott, Paul Rudd) must help a pair of impressionable boys navigate the troubled waters of youth." That description sounds like a smarmy physical comedy derivative with cheap scatological bits. Except that Xfinity gave it a rating of 3 out of 4 stars, so I decided to take a look at it.To my pleasure, the film turned out to be a much more sophisticated movie. The two men, who are allowed to do community service instead of jail, are assigned to a big brother type program. The more intellectual of the two men, Danny, who is disillusioned with the world, is assigned to an immature teen who doesn't fit in with his peers; instead he devotes himself to participation in an on-going Dungeons and Dragons type reenactment played by a mixed group of adults and children who and his job. Wheeler, a care-free womanizer, is assigned a tough young foul-mouthed kid with whom no previous volunteer had lasted more than one day. The story shows the changes the interactions of the two "Littles" and their "Bigs"have on each other. There are a number of cheap double entendre sexual references, but they don't diminish the film too much.

First of all, I'd like to say that I enjoy these "crew" movies. By "crew" I mean movies starring the same actors. Anchorman, 40 year old virgin, knocked up, Dewey cox, Ricky bobby, super bad, etc. So with this starring Paul Rudd (part of the crew) and the brilliant Sean Williams Scott (Stiffler) I figured this would be great. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was good, but (for me) it wasn't laugh out loud funny like the other "crew" movies. Everyone on here said it was great, their ratings were from 8/10 to 10/10. So I figured, awesome. But I think I seen a different movie than the other users, because I ended up giving it a 6/10. Would I recommend it to others? I would, but would I own it on DVD? No.

If you are having a bad day,or bad week. If you are looking for a film that will make you laugh and forget about your troubles. I don't think Role Models is that movie for you.The film centers around Danny(Paul Rudd) and Wheeler(Seann William Scott) Two juice promoters, who go to schools promoting the product, telling kids to stay off drugs, and more juice. But Danny is having the worst week ever, and crashes his company car, with Wheeler in the seat next to him. His soon to be ex girlfriend Beth(Elizabeth Banks) who is a lawyer, manages to avoid getting them jail time, by doing hours of community service, volunteering at a big brother place called Sturdy Wings led by Gayle(Jane Lynch). Wheeler is assigned to Ronnie(Bobb'e J Thompson) who is 10 years old, and has a foul mouth like he's Chris Rock. Danny is assigned to Augie(McLovins, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who likes to dress like a knight, and fight like he is in medieval times. But will this be good for Danny and Wheeler, or will they be better off in jail?Okay I'm not gonna beat around the bush, this movie was very unpleasant in many ways. Namely the Ronnie character, hearing those bad words coming out of a kid that young, was very shocking. If he was a little bit older, it would not have mater'd as much. I mean what where his parents thinking, when they sign'd him on to this. Elizabeth Banks character is so unwatchable, maybe I was supposed to feel bad for her character, but I felt nothing, because she is annoyingly predictably portrayed as a female who would be played in these types of comedies. And Jane Lynch, who's the worst of the worst. She delivers the most overacting performance ever. Playing a former drug addict, who acts like she still is on drugs. Listening to her give all that annoying dialog, made me want to throw my head up against the wall. Seann William Scott once again playing another Stifler like character, he should really try to separate himself, and this film won't do it. And the more Scott tries to hard to be funny, is what keeps him from being funny.Now Paul Rudd on the other hand, I'm gonna separate from the others in the film, cause he manages to deliver a solid performance, although he does not get higher laughs, but he is the most interesting character from the rest. Cause Rudd does not overact, and does not try so hard. The scenes with him and Mintz-Plasse are watchable. But the rest of the film is so stupid, it picks up at times. But it becomes so predictable and uninteresting. It is a reminder that these types of comedies try nothing new, there all the same, they take no chances. Role Models is an example of that.

I have to write this review because I can't believe this film is rated as high as 7! Two offenders sentenced on 150 hours community work. And guess what, their job is to be role models for kids... Unreal. The story is just unbearable. 80% of the film is centred around role play battles and kid who is stuck in his own fairy tale bubble life. I just couldn't make myself believe in to this poor story line. Boring as hell. Yes, the characters are dumb geeks and sometimes funny but hello...? Like I've said- majority of the film is just painful too watch. Try to look out for better comedy. This is pure waste of time. The lady who runs the organisation called Sturdy Wings in the film is deeply annoying with her acting skills.
