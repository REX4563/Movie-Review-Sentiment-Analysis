Beautiful movie from master-director Lasse Hallström (The Cider House Rules, The Shipping News, What's Eating Gilbert Grape) with wonderful performances by Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, and Hallström's wife Lena Olin. "Chocolat" is a very beautiful and touching movie about a single mother with a daughter who decides to open a "chocolaterie" in a very conservative village during Lent. What follows almost looks like a fairytale: the characters, the story, the music, the whole idea of an old conservative French village I liked the movie a lot. It has everything: a laugh, a cry, a wonderful story and some amazing acting performances. Juliette Binoche is made to play this kind of caring and sensitive women. Although Johnny Depp had a very small part in this movie, he was excellent as always. I personally think that Judi Dench gave one of her best performances in "Chocolat", truly great acting! Maybe not Hallström's best; I liked "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" and "The Cider House Rules" more; but certainly worth watching.8/10

Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter move to a rural conservative French town and open a chocolate shop. The town is run by the mayor Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) who is a traditionalist. He is not amused by Vianne's life and her ideas. They start to fight for the soul of the town. Then a band of gypsies comes to town with the sexy Roux (Johnny Depp).It's a slow moving story. It has its charms, and Juliette Binoche is as lovely as ever. The actors are all great. Although Lena Olin is miscast as an abused wife. The role needs a more mousy actor. Lena is way too powerful for the role.The movie is a sort of talky lyrical erotic fable, and it starts with the glow that Binoche gives off. The comedy is fleeting. The battle between Reynaud and Rocher doesn't have the needed tension. It does have heart. But the pacing is slow for a two hours movie. Johnny Depp is a cool river traveling musician, and comes in a little too late in the movie. When he comes in after almost half of the movie over, he mostly distracts. Overall, this movie is a little too slow for my taste.

I saw Chocolat again last night. I had forgotten how lovely a movie it is! People need stories like this these days.Some other viewers have complained about the predictability of the plot. I don't think it's any more predictable than an average Hollywood film; I find most action films much more predictable and shallow.The most beautiful thing about the movie (as about Hallström movies generally) is the wise, warm-hearted story about things that matter: love, sincerity, tolerance, standing up for the things you believe are righteous and good, and enjoying the simple pleasures in life, like a good dinner with friends, or like chocolate :) And Hallström tells his stories so delicately, in his very own style, with fine nuances and a twinkle of humour in his eye. Binoche, Dench, Depp, Molina, Thivisol etc. are fantastic.
I'm so glad I saw the movie. It always makes me think and feel a lot.

What a pure delight Chocolat is. Gentle, Beautiful and heart warming. That could describe many films but unlike others it displays no clichés or tired ideas. It is refreshing and pure. The cast is superb, Binoche is a wonder who glides effortlessly through the part of the mysterious and beautiful Vianne. Molina is excellent as the repressed yet lustful Comte Renauld. Depp is as eccentric and wonderful as always.In fact the whole cast is fantastic. The story has all the elements of a wonderful fairy tale yet the perfect direction and the delightfully authentic french setting makes it serious movie. You really care about the characters and the many inter-twinned story lines keep you watching with joy.It also has a wonderful score and excellent costumes and sets, in fact in writing this review I cannot think of any criticism I could make. It is that rare thing : a truly perfect movie.

Chocolat, like its rich, creamy namesake, is charming, and satisfying. Given the billing of actors, and the film's director (Lasse Hallstrom of The Cider House Rules) and production team (the Weinstein brothers), one would expect the film to be well put-together, and it is.Judi Dench is, as always, impeccable. She surely is one of the most naturally- gifted actors to grace the screen. Juliette Binoche carries her part consistently, however, there were brief flashes when I thought she looked a little too forced in the role of benevolent chocolatier.I personally felt that it was the work of the supporting actors that stole the show: The aforementioned Judi Dench; Alfred Molina as the Comte who controls the town, but, in the end, cannot control himself; Lena Olin as the kicked-while-she's-down wife; Johnny Depp, sublimely heavenly as the "river rat"/love interest and who could forget Victoire Thivisol as the guileless daughter Anouk.These actors bring a quality to this film, yet I felt that some moments in the movie were a little contrived and erring slightly on corny- for example *spoiler* Towards the end of the film, the scene in which several brave townspeople band together to help make chocolate treats for an upcoming festival seems designed to stir up "warm fuzzies" inside viewers. Also, it sometimes seems as if Vienne fixes the lives of the villagers a little too quickly and neatly- which is why this film could be seen as attempting to pander to an audience that wishes to be fulfilled in an uplifting, satisfying way.This film was also marketed as a comedy, and the first half fits the bill perfectly. Naturally, it's not a laugh-a-minute, but there are many funny lines that make you giggle.OK, so it can be a little corny at moments. However, as Chocolat progresses, issues such as acceptance, tolerance, the breaking of archaic tradition, and the finding of inner strength, particularly in women, are well explored.All in all, Chocolat is a fine film that will be enjoyed by many people, almost as satisfying as their favorite chocolate treat.

-This film transports through the art of story telling.-It takes you out of your situation and introduces you to a group of fascinating people.-Each character either is beautiful or becomes beautiful.Chocalat can be loved on the surface or somewhere more profound. The audience can choose the depth in which they wish to receive it. Little children may be entranced with the way chocolate looks when melted and stirred, whereas adults are entranced by the emotional impact of learning how to not deny one's self of the little pleasures in life (and also be captivated by melted chocolate!) Chocalat is grounded in emotional reality, but possess magical qualities breaching into the realms of a fairy tale.An entire family can enjoy this one or you could simply watch it on your own.I sometimes like to have the film on in the background while doing homework. Eventually I am immersed without fail.DO NOT DENY YOURSELF THIS PLEASURE

After just having seen it I understand why this is called one of the best films ever. This is neorealism and a big masterpiece. Everything are so simply put together and still so very touching( I actually started to cry in the end, I think it's the only film that have ever made me cry). The acting by the mother and child are more then perfect and so is the cinematography and the direction. This woman's character really shows the awfulness it is to be as poor as the family in the film.I had expected this film to be a masterpiece but might not as touching and powerful as it really was. It's the simple story about a woman opening a chocalate store and the town's oppostion to her. How true and how sad. In this world, people's hearts grow colder by the second.

This movie is based in 1950s France in a small town, it's a quaint movie. I just don't like the message it's a fight between the old catholic mayor and the new age chocolatier who comes to town. Included in it in the final moments is the theology of Christ the writer wants us to see. Please just let me shoehorn my religion into this town and then try and disappear like Mary Poppins. Making the movie very divisive.Sure if you want your movies served with a side of politics this movie is for you, but I don't like sides so this movie isn't for me.

Chocolat is a pleasure for the eyes, a feast of decadent visuals with tasteful costumes, sets and of course, edible delights. The most wonderful thing about this movie has to be the cast, headed by the beautiful Frenchwoman Juliette Binoche as Vianne, a nomad who travels with her daughter and sets up shop in a tiny French village. She is somewhat of a rebel, who doesn't go to church and believes in giving into the desires an passions most people restrict, especially during the holy time of Lent. As Vianne tries to survive the tense and strict society in which she dwells, she comes across various people all with different desires and pleasures, including Judi Dench as a bitter old woman, Carrie-Ann Moss as a strict and upright mother and Lena Olin as a wife with an unsteady home life.All changes for Vianne when Roux,a handsome riverboat wanderer played by Johnny Depp shows up on the shore. He is more of a nomad than she and he inflicts in her desires she never thought she had and soon is beginning to get a taste of her own medicine. Despite this rather stocky and formulaic plot line, the movie is quite enjoyable though not completely satisfying. It dances with ideas about forgetting your moral conscience and giving into every desire, which I am sure cannot be helpful to anyone. Perhaps I am misjudging it, but it seems almost as if the movie is more interested in simply showing the power of the chocolate than the actual process involved in making a change in your life. It does have elements of fantasy, which I don't mind, but I find it hard to mix fantasy with reality and make it work all the way.Despite its shortcomings, this is a sweet and spicy delight with a top-notch cast, some gorgeous sets and costumes, and some interesting twist on chocolate recipes. It makes for a great escapist movie, a place I'm sure we all wish we could go to.

Chocolat is a good film. The plot is indeed very good, and despite being simple at a first sight it have various layers and subtle symbolism, specifically in the 'chocolate' types. For example, for the boy with a spicy personality, bitter chocolate she offered. And to the woman depressed, scarred by life,with bitter personality, she then offered spicy chocolate. The chocolat itself represented some kind of a freedom and liberation of the repressed side of the persons. Very interesting, and it's definitely a film to be appreciated. The way the city reacts is also very curious. The characters which appears in the film have special kind of personality and a subtle meaning in them as well. And is up to the viewer to discover what these meanings are.The art direction is also good, very suggestive and definitely is important to the film overall. The natural aura that the film exudes has much to do with the excellent work in the lightning and in the scenario,with rudimentary, but harmful stores in the small Italian city. The soundtrack is wonderful, and fits perfectly each scene. The acting is overall very good, Alfred Molina,Julliete Binoche and Judi Dench specifically are stunning in their roles.I highly recommend this film. 8.2/10

A film to awaken the senses and stimulate the sweet tooth, `Chocolat,' directed by Lasse Hallstrom and starring Juliette Binoche. is both a sensuous and sensational delight.  In the mid 50s, as if borne on the winds of fate, a somewhat mysterious woman arrives in a small town in France, with a young daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) in tow and a special talent that soon has the townsfolk in quite a stir.  Binoche is Vianne Rocher, a woman who uses her exotic recipe for chocolate to unlock the repressed sensibilities of the predominately Catholic citizenry, heretofore kept under the rigid and righteous thumb of the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), with no respite or help, even from the town's young and inexperienced priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor).  And because Vianne has the audacity to open her chocolate shop during Lent, when of course her sumptuous treats are forbidden, she quickly runs afoul of the Mayor and a battle of wills between the two ensues.  Her chocolates are irresistible, but the Mayor has tradition and religion on his side, and it puts the free-spirited Vianne-- who has something of the gypsy in her-- to the test. 	As a director, Hallstrom has just the right touch that brings out the best this story has to offer, which is to say, quite a bit.  It's an affecting and funny movie that will touch you emotionally as it involves you with the characters; Hallstrom knows what buttons to push and when, and it works splendidly.  There's a touch of mystery surrounding Vianne that underscores the sensitivity of the story, and Hallstrom never allows it to become maudlin, which successfully maintains the integrity of the drama.  And there are moments throughout the film that evoke an almost dream-like sense of pacification that draw you in as you indulge in the mouth watering visual pleasures of the chocolate.  Be forewarned, though, it's a tough one for diabetics to watch. 	What Hallstrom also has going for him in this one is an absolutely exquisite cast, many of whom give Oscar worthy, memorable performances, beginning with the superb Juliette Binoche.  There's an earthy, enigmatic and classic sense of beauty about her that make her presence on screen captivating; she's simply a joy to behold.  Judi Dench (Amande), meanwhile, does a terrific character turn as a mother whose daughter, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), deems her an embarrassment and a bad influence on her son, Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koening), and Lena Olin (Josephine) is outstanding as well, as an unhappy woman who finds hope in Vianne's undaunted spirit. Three extraordinary performances from gifted actresses that should be recognized with Oscar nominations.  And Molina, too, as the narrow minded Comte, gives possibly the best performance of his career, while Johnny Depp (Roux) lends some charm as the leader of a roving community of river people. 	Rounding out the supporting cast are John Wood (Guillaume), Peter Stormare (Serge) and Leslie Caron (Madame Audel).  Possibly the `sweetest' film of the year, as well as one of the best, `Chocolat' is a visual and emotional triumph that will warm your heart and make your taste buds salivate, with a story and characters as rich and satisfying as the candy they embrace.  It's a film with a human touch whose images and sensitivity will remain with you long after the screen has gone dark; an uplifting, entertaining movie that proves that the answers to the mysteries of life just may be found in that box of chocolates, after all.  I rate this one 10/10.

SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS POST:Chocolat, is a charming whimsical movie with interesting characters, beautiful photography and an interesting overall story. I enjoyed it. It was different then I thought it would be from the previews, less of a fairytale, and more in similarity to a Toby Miguire movie called: Pleasantville, which I'm sure many reading this will have seen. But that is the movie that this strongly reminded me of.This is a very feel good movie and featured a terrific cast. I was a bit surprised by Johnny Depp, he didn't walk away with the movie and steal every scene, to the contrary, his character was extremely underused. But the cast, all of them, were great and the movie a charmer.As good as this was, I didn't adore it, more liked it a lot. It does move slowly and it's long. As mentioned, I expected more of a fairy tale, I think I was expecting a bit to much from the previews, but that's not to put this movie down at all, because it was really well done on all levels. The story is involving, you care about the characters, the movie does have some mystery and fairy tale elements to it, and the linking of Chocolate to joy and love of life is quite touching. This movie may not be perfect but is far from a bad movie.Chocolat maybe thought of as to feel good by some, but I personally do not agree with that, a movie does not have to be dark all through to be a good movie. This is definitely something you have to be in the mood for, because of it's length, and the whole overall mood of the movie and it's not all sweetness and light either, there's some tough scenes (though the ending is as heartwarming as you can get.) Chocolat is a movie I'd rate a 7.5 for good, not a 10(though I could easily see why someone else would rate it a 10.) This is an uplifting charmer of a film, set in a lovely french village, featuring a great cast, a touch of mystery and fantasy elements, capped off with a "Pleasantville" type of message. Not a bad way to spend a few hours!

I have only seen this movie for the first time today. I have to admit that I hesitated somewhat as I did not believe I would like it because it was described to me as a 'chick flick', a genre I do not subscribe to even though I am a girl. How wrong was that description. I loved the film, the story, the scenery. Such genuine & diverse characters. The actors chosen were perfect for their roles, I cannot imagine anyone else playing the parts. The DVD I had was borrowed, but I intend to buy a copy for myself as it would fit into my small library of movies. I have to see it again & this time I will share the experience with my partner as I know he will appreciate the story. Lida

Like 'The Last of the Mohicans' (Michael Mann 1992), this is a film that I liked when I watched it in the cinema soon after it came out and that disappointed me when I re-visited it recently. It is not only that the director indulges in scene after scene that is making the same point - here about how the count dislikes the Juliette Binoche-character because she opens her chocolate shop during lent or about how she wins friends among the downtrodden and lonely. The main points are that I meanwhile have got to know France, and once you have done so you realise that despite being filmed on location, 'Chocolat' has got as good as nothing to do with that country. The film presents a Hollywood-France, a fantasy with the most tenuous links to reality (which is maybe why it was a success everywhere but in France, where it flopped). Does anything in 'Chocolat' indicate that in the late 1950s the communists were a major force in France? In the Tarn department practically all villages and small towns had communist mayors - the count character in 'Chocolat' is weirder than weird. And who are these river people supposed to be? No social group like that ever existed. Another point is, I evidently had to grow up in order to realise how deeply kitschy the thing is. There is the background story with its faux-mysticism, and I don't understand why Binoche's cheesy trick with her rotating ceramique plate does not immediately drive everyone from the shop on whom she tries it. The film is not sugary kitsch. Sugar is the genuine article, after all. 'Chocolat' is saccharine-coated kitsch of the worst kind.

This film is not recommended to those who are on a low calorie diet, because it makes you want to dive into a bowl of succulent chocolate. It's amazing how a simple movie can do that, without even using the scent to lure you. Chocolate turns an ordinary village of France into a sweet world, a fairy tale among simple people. The costumes and the scenery are very believable, really capturing the era and the atmosphere, of that time. But the story is good as well, without getting boring, speaking about the love that can tie family and friends together, the stereotypes that support closed communities of the countryside and how a simple ingredient like chocolate, can turn everything upside down. Great performances from the main and supporting cast actors and a memorable soundtrack. All in all chocolate is a remarkable film.

I had heard all the rave reviews, saw the number of Oscar nominations this flick received but still wasn't convinced it was a movie I'd like.  I want to kick myself now for waiting this long to see it!  Yes, I forsook the big screen for the video but I wasn't disappointed a bit.Chocolat is a wonderful movie.  It deals with real issues that people face. The characters are believable because they have flaws.  They've got inward struggles which makes this film even better.  It's a story of the human condition and how even deep prejudices can be overcome by the simple act of kindness and the willingness to strive for individuality.I have to admit the only reason I wanted to watch this movie at first was because of Johnny Depp.  I have to say I loved his performance as Roux.  I wished the writers would've done more with his character but what we did get to feast on was incredible.  Juliette Binoche was also incredible as Vianne and the chemistry between all the actors was great.I would recommend Chocolat.  If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?  It's great to see there are still film makers out there that have a sense of humanity.  Chocolat is all of that and more.
Chocolat was indeed Mmmm, Mmmm, good!!

Beautiful movie from master-director Lasse Hallström (The Cider House Rules, The Shipping News, What's Eating Gilbert Grape) with wonderful performances by Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, and Hallström's wife Lena Olin. "Chocolat" is a very beautiful and touching movie about a single mother with a daughter who decides to open a "chocolaterie" in a very conservative village during Lent. What follows almost looks like a fairytale: the characters, the story, the music, the whole idea of an old conservative French village I liked the movie a lot. It has everything: a laugh, a cry, a wonderful story and some amazing acting performances. Juliette Binoche is made to play this kind of caring and sensitive women. Although Johnny Depp had a very small part in this movie, he was excellent as always. I personally think that Judi Dench gave one of her best performances in "Chocolat", truly great acting! Maybe not Hallström's best; I liked "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" and "The Cider House Rules" more; but certainly worth watching.8/10

Chocolat****  out of  ****Chocolat gives new meaning to one of my favorite film phrases eye candy. As the title would suggest it is a very sweet film, and not only for the gobs and gobs of luscious, mouthwatering, little morsels.  There are parts of the film that look like they could belong to a particularly delectable episode of `Martha Stewart Living', but if you can get past the pangs of hunger it will certainly inflict, you will find there is a lot more to this seemingly charming and simple story.The film plays in the style of all whimsical children's fairy tales, while at the same time blending in a series of very serious adult themes. It chronicles the exploits of single mother Vianne Rocher, played as usual to a wonderful effect by Juliette Binoche, and her sugary but confused 6-year-old daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), who blow in on a forceful winter wind to the small rural French town of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes. There they open a small chocolate shop.  Now this seems innocent enough but the people of the town have different views.  For one the shop has been opened at the very unwelcomed time of Lent (a religious fast), during which new temptations certainly aren't invited.  Secondly the town's new residents refuse to attend the Sunday morning worship service.  Vianne soon finds herself to be the center of the town gossip and distaste, led by the mayor (Alfred Molina).  The battle heats up between allegedly pagan Vianne, and the highly conservative, stuffed-shirt townspeople.  At start it seems the Rochers are losing, but the fight soon turns as the townsfolk begin to discover the mouth-melting effects of Vianne's wonderful taste-teasing treats.Misadventure after misadventure occur as the couple come in contact with a wide array of colorful characters (just when you think he must be an extra in comes Johnny Depp), solving their problems while at the same time selling their chocolates.  The moral is left fairly open, and can be interpreted in many ways.  My personal views are these:  That to be good and righteous, doesn't mean you can't be different, you should accept everyone, not necessarily for who they are, but for what they are, human beings. Everyone deserves a proper chance.  In the end all characters  realize the error of their ways and live together happily and harmoniously.Chocolat has opened to mixed reviews.  Some critics find it to be overly simple, but I think that it is the movie's simplicity that drives it to become so charmingly enthralling.  Granted at times it does become at bit silly, but it all ends to a good warm effect.  Apparently the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences share my views as the film was nominated for five academy awards, Best Picture, Best Actress (Binoche), Best Supporting Actress (Judi Dench), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score.Chocolat is a mouthwatering piece of movie magic.  Definitely worth a look!  It has it's flaws but they are easily covered up by it's great performances (particularly by Binoche), beautiful scenery, giddy musical score, and delightful story.  Oh, and those wonderful chocolates.

Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter move to a rural conservative French town and open a chocolate shop. The town is run by the mayor Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) who is a traditionalist. He is not amused by Vianne's life and her ideas. They start to fight for the soul of the town. Then a band of gypsies comes to town with the sexy Roux (Johnny Depp).It's a slow moving story. It has its charms, and Juliette Binoche is as lovely as ever. The actors are all great. Although Lena Olin is miscast as an abused wife. The role needs a more mousy actor. Lena is way too powerful for the role.The movie is a sort of talky lyrical erotic fable, and it starts with the glow that Binoche gives off. The comedy is fleeting. The battle between Reynaud and Rocher doesn't have the needed tension. It does have heart. But the pacing is slow for a two hours movie. Johnny Depp is a cool river traveling musician, and comes in a little too late in the movie. When he comes in after almost half of the movie over, he mostly distracts.

It makes for a great escapist movie, a place I'm sure we all wish we could go to.

Chocolat is about the oddball in the village, the outsider bringing new perspective. It's presented to us as a tale told from mother to daughter, almost like a legend.The photography is beautiful. The sets are very immersive and realistic, with fitting wardrobe. The story is interesting and light hearted, with some hit of drama and laughters. The characters are well built and very well played.The most annoying thing about this film is the mix of accent, real or false. I admit it's probably because French is my mother tongue, but still. You eventually get used to it though. Also, the ending is just too perfect, especially concerning the mayor. I know the whole story has a fairy- tale undertone, but he completely reverse not only his view on the stranger, but also his demeanor and his religious views on the sanctity of marriage. It's too much.Still, I recommend to everyone, especially if you like a bit of romance and tall tales.

Boring, paint-by-numbers Miramax attempt at a French movie about a "feisty" young woman with a troubled past and a heart of gold who blows into town and shows everyone how uptight they are.  Every scene suffused with warm Hallmark-card hues, every character completely predictable -- the crotchety old woman with a saucy past, the timid wife whose husband beats her, the sweet old bachelor too shy to court the war widow.  All the actors in this awful travesty -- Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, even the cute little dogs -- have done far better work, which "Chocolat" is obviously trying to cash in on.In short, a good date movie -- if your date just happened to have had a lobotomy. Do yourself a favor and rent a real French film, where, e.g., people actually have sex instead of just talking about it.

This movie is based in 1950s France in a small town, it's a quaint movie. I just don't like the message it's a fight between the old catholic mayor and the new age chocolatier who comes to town. Included in it in the final moments is the theology of Christ the writer wants us to see. Please just let me shoehorn my religion into this town and then try and disappear like Mary Poppins. Making the movie very divisive.Sure if you want your movies served with a side of politics this movie is for you, but I don't like sides so this movie isn't for me.

First I borrowed this movie from videostore And loved it so much that soon I bought the DVD so I could watch it again. That's how much i love it. I truly regret not watching it, while it was in the cinemas, it would have been great to see it on the big screen. This movie has everything: humanity, love, magic (and gorgeous cinematography), comedy, sadness, great acting. There is depth and strength to the characters in the movie. The costumes and special effects are great too. I loved the acting and how all these story lines were woven into a beautiful, delightful fable. This movie has got the heart. The music is beautiful too, it is so enchanting. It is so wonderful and bittersweet, like chocolate for the soul :) I strongly recommend it

After just having seen it I understand why this is called one of the best films ever. This is neorealism and a big masterpiece. Everything are so simply put together and still so very touching( I actually started to cry in the end, I think it's the only film that have ever made me cry). The acting by the mother and child are more then perfect and so is the cinematography and the direction. This woman's character really shows the awfulness it is to be as poor as the family in the film.I had expected this film to be a masterpiece but might not as touching and powerful as it really was. It's the simple story about a woman opening a chocalate store and the town's oppostion to her. How true and how sad. In this world, people's hearts grow colder by the second.

Chocolat is a good film. The plot is indeed very good, and despite being simple at a first sight it have various layers and subtle symbolism, specifically in the 'chocolate' types. For example, for the boy with a spicy personality, bitter chocolate she offered. And to the woman depressed, scarred by life,with bitter personality, she then offered spicy chocolate. The chocolat itself represented some kind of a freedom and liberation of the repressed side of the persons. Very interesting, and it's definitely a film to be appreciated. The way the city reacts is also very curious. The characters which appears in the film have special kind of personality and a subtle meaning in them as well. And is up to the viewer to discover what these meanings are.The art direction is also good, very suggestive and definitely is important to the film overall. The natural aura that the film exudes has much to do with the excellent work in the lightning and in the scenario,with rudimentary, but harmful stores in the small Italian city. The soundtrack is wonderful, and fits perfectly each scene. The acting is overall very good, Alfred Molina,Julliete Binoche and Judi Dench specifically are stunning in their roles.I highly recommend this film. 8.2/10

SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS POST:Chocolat, is a charming whimsical movie with interesting characters, beautiful photography and an interesting overall story. I enjoyed it. It was different then I thought it would be from the previews, less of a fairytale, and more in similarity to a Toby Miguire movie called: Pleasantville, which I'm sure many reading this will have seen. But that is the movie that this strongly reminded me of.This is a very feel good movie and featured a terrific cast. I was a bit surprised by Johnny Depp, he didn't walk away with the movie and steal every scene, to the contrary, his character was extremely underused. But the cast, all of them, were great and the movie a charmer.As good as this was, I didn't adore it, more liked it a lot. It does move slowly and it's long. As mentioned, I expected more of a fairy tale, I think I was expecting a bit to much from the previews, but that's not to put this movie down at all, because it was really well done on all levels. The story is involving, you care about the characters, the movie does have some mystery and fairy tale elements to it, and the linking of Chocolate to joy and love of life is quite touching. This movie may not be perfect but is far from a bad movie.Chocolat maybe thought of as to feel good by some, but I personally do not agree with that, a movie does not have to be dark all through to be a good movie. This is definitely something you have to be in the mood for, because of it's length, and the whole overall mood of the movie and it's not all sweetness and light either, there's some tough scenes (though the ending is as heartwarming as you can get.) Chocolat is a movie I'd rate a 7.5 for good, not a 10(though I could easily see why someone else would rate it a 10.) This is an uplifting charmer of a film, set in a lovely french village, featuring a great cast, a touch of mystery and fantasy elements, capped off with a "Pleasantville" type of message. Not a bad way to spend a few hours!

A film to awaken the senses and stimulate the sweet tooth, `Chocolat,' directed by Lasse Hallstrom and starring Juliette Binoche. is both a sensuous and sensational delight.  In the mid 50s, as if borne on the winds of fate, a somewhat mysterious woman arrives in a small town in France, with a young daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) in tow and a special talent that soon has the townsfolk in quite a stir.  Binoche is Vianne Rocher, a woman who uses her exotic recipe for chocolate to unlock the repressed sensibilities of the predominately Catholic citizenry, heretofore kept under the rigid and righteous thumb of the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), with no respite or help, even from the town's young and inexperienced priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor).  And because Vianne has the audacity to open her chocolate shop during Lent, when of course her sumptuous treats are forbidden, she quickly runs afoul of the Mayor and a battle of wills between the two ensues.  Her chocolates are irresistible, but the Mayor has tradition and religion on his side, and it puts the free-spirited Vianne-- who has something of the gypsy in her-- to the test. 	As a director, Hallstrom has just the right touch that brings out the best this story has to offer, which is to say, quite a bit.  It's an affecting and funny movie that will touch you emotionally as it involves you with the characters; Hallstrom knows what buttons to push and when, and it works splendidly.  There's a touch of mystery surrounding Vianne that underscores the sensitivity of the story, and Hallstrom never allows it to become maudlin, which successfully maintains the integrity of the drama.  And there are moments throughout the film that evoke an almost dream-like sense of pacification that draw you in as you indulge in the mouth watering visual pleasures of the chocolate.  Be forewarned, though, it's a tough one for diabetics to watch. 	What Hallstrom also has going for him in this one is an absolutely exquisite cast, many of whom give Oscar worthy, memorable performances, beginning with the superb Juliette Binoche.  There's an earthy, enigmatic and classic sense of beauty about her that make her presence on screen captivating; she's simply a joy to behold.  Judi Dench (Amande), meanwhile, does a terrific character turn as a mother whose daughter, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), deems her an embarrassment and a bad influence on her son, Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koening), and Lena Olin (Josephine) is outstanding as well, as an unhappy woman who finds hope in Vianne's undaunted spirit. Three extraordinary performances from gifted actresses that should be recognized with Oscar nominations.  And Molina, too, as the narrow minded Comte, gives possibly the best performance of his career, while Johnny Depp (Roux) lends some charm as the leader of a roving community of river people. 	Rounding out the supporting cast are John Wood (Guillaume), Peter Stormare (Serge) and Leslie Caron (Madame Audel).  Possibly the `sweetest' film of the year, as well as one of the best, `Chocolat' is a visual and emotional triumph that will warm your heart and make your taste buds salivate, with a story and characters as rich and satisfying as the candy they embrace.  It's a film with a human touch whose images and sensitivity will remain with you long after the screen has gone dark; an uplifting, entertaining movie that proves that the answers to the mysteries of life just may be found in that box of chocolates, after all.  I rate this one 10/10.

Unbelievable when a film so different and has so much charm but doesn't get awards I'm offended! Anyway though Chococlat is lovely while being a bit boring which is ok cause it's very well done. I don't have much to say it's a decadent treat of beauty.

I actually was rooting for "Chocolat" to win Best Picture for 2000. If you're the type who easily gives in to temptation, then this is the movie for you. Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter open a chocolate shop in a small French town where the mayor has suppressed all forms of happiness. But once Vianne and her daughter start selling their chocolates, things start to change for the better. And some people in town don't like that."Chocolat" reminded me of "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"...in a good way. The idea of an outsider coming in and upsetting the status quo always makes a good movie. This is a movie that neither your eyes, mouth or stomach can afford to miss.

It's hard to say anything else! The message of this movie is extremely straight forward and is made clear in the first few minutes. Nothing really comes along to enrich that message; everything potters along quite pleasantly to the obvious ending.I didn't find this dislikeable (apart from the irritating accents - the m'sieurs and madames etc were pretty objectionable, until I kind of mentally blocked them out, but the worst was probably the American kiddies in the Sunday School who had no ability/made no attempt to sound the least bit French) but I didn't find it superb either. There are so many other films that have done this kind of thing better.The sudden and quite absurd changes in personality that some of the characters underwent didn't seem to me to make sense in the context of the film. If it had been a bit more bizarre in general these unreal plot devices may well have been more believable.My best recommendation for this film would be, if the mild sex scenes were removed, as a kind of slightly more mature 'Madeline' for kids, or perhaps young teenagers. If you like films that are quite pretty, quite innocuous and potter along in a friendly manner, this one's certainly for you!

I have only seen this movie for the first time today. I have to admit that I hesitated somewhat as I did not believe I would like it because it was described to me as a 'chick flick', a genre I do not subscribe to even though I am a girl. How wrong was that description. I loved the film, the story, the scenery. Such genuine & diverse characters. The actors chosen were perfect for their roles, I cannot imagine anyone else playing the parts. The DVD I had was borrowed, but I intend to buy a copy for myself as it would fit into my small library of movies. I have to see it again & this time I will share the experience with my partner as I know he will appreciate the story. Lida

From director Lasse Hallströmof (The Cider House Rules), this is a pretty good film of how a delicious substance can change a town in both good and bad ways. Basically, in a French village (which explains the title being French) run by the mayor, Comte Paul De Reynaud (Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina) a new woman moves to the town. Soon enough, Vianne Rocher (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk open a chocolate shop. The only concern for some people is that she has opened during rent, but she still insists on letting people try her new recipes and treats. Unfortunately, not everyone approves, especially the mayor who tries to make everyone turn against Vianne. Also starring Memento's Carrie-Anne Moss as Caroline Clairmont, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Dame Judi Dench as Armande Voizin, Johnny Depp as Roux and BAFTA nominated Lena Olin as Josephine Muscat. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music, Original Score for Rachel Portman, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Score. Juliette Binoche was number 88, and Johnny Depp number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Dame Judi Dench was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Depp was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Dench was number 8, and Depp number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!

Like 'The Last of the Mohicans' (Michael Mann 1992), this is a film that I liked when I watched it in the cinema soon after it came out and that disappointed me when I re-visited it recently. It is not only that the director indulges in scene after scene that is making the same point - here about how the count dislikes the Juliette Binoche-character because she opens her chocolate shop during lent or about how she wins friends among the downtrodden and lonely. The main points are that I meanwhile have got to know France, and once you have done so you realise that despite being filmed on location, 'Chocolat' has got as good as nothing to do with that country. The film presents a Hollywood-France, a fantasy with the most tenuous links to reality (which is maybe why it was a success everywhere but in France, where it flopped). Does anything in 'Chocolat' indicate that in the late 1950s the communists were a major force in France? In the Tarn department practically all villages and small towns had communist mayors - the count character in 'Chocolat' is weirder than weird. And who are these river people supposed to be? No social group like that ever existed. Another point is, I evidently had to grow up in order to realise how deeply kitschy the thing is. There is the background story with its faux-mysticism, and I don't understand why Binoche's cheesy trick with her rotating ceramique plate does not immediately drive everyone from the shop on whom she tries it. The film is not sugary kitsch. Sugar is the genuine article, after all. 'Chocolat' is saccharine-coated kitsch of the worst kind.

We all have our vices.  Vices make us complete human beings.  We can surpress them and deny them, but we can't quite run away from them.  Does it not strike you as a little humorous when someone looks at a menu, knows exactly what they want, but then decides not to get it for fear they will not only offend their God, but offend their own nature?  Lasse Hollstrom's latest film, Chocolat, knows all about that person.Juliette Binoche stars as Vianne Rosher, a chocolate shop owner who not only gets people to talk about their forbidden fruits, but also has the ability to make people happily indulge in them.  She, along with her daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), moves into a quiet French village during Lent and opens her chocolate shop. The townspeople look in the window, admire the confections for a moment, then walk on by. One diabetic woman, Amande (Judi Dench), decides to stay for a little while.  Vianne puts a colorful ceramic plate on the table and spins it around.  She asks what Amande sees in the image. Amande tells her and Vianne presumes to know exactly what kind of confection Amande would like the best. We could only dream of such customer service this time of year.Amande's young grandson, Luc, an aspiring artist, also can't seem to stay away from the chocolate store, in spite of the wishes of his churchgoing mother (Carrie-Anne Moss).  Actually, the whole town goes to the same church and it doesn't take long before the Mayor (Alfred Molena) has his say against the shop, since many of the chocolates have been carved into the shapes of naked women and have names such as Nipples of Venus.  The chocolates also seem to be changing people's behavior.  A sexless, joyless married couple all of a sudden can't keep their Butterfingers off each other.The non-churchgoing Vianne eventually becomes the center of the town's controversy, but she soon has company after the arrival of the river rats, a group of Irish merchants who travel by boat to pawn off whatever they can, much to the dismay of the townspeople.  Here, Vianne meets Roux (Johnny Depp), and they become fast friends and, well, you know the rest.The story of Chocolat could be described in one sentence-Footloose, only instead of dancing, it's chocolates.  However, in this film we have some magic realism to deal with.  Unfortunately, the film does not quite develop its own `magical' ideas.  It gets bogged down by the usual story elements an d sub-plots we often see with this kind of story.  We get the battered wife who finds solace in Vianne's shop and we get the burning of a particular place (here, a boat) to further drive home the point that outsiders will not be tolerated.  I would have liked a little more `magic.'On the other hand, we do get some magic in the form of the performances. Juliette Binoche actually smiles and acts charming, as opposed to the sorrowful and pensive roles in which we usually see her.  What a relief to finally see her carrying a picture with warmth, confidence and wit, as well as beauty.  The guitar-twanging Johnny Depp (reuniting with his Gilbert Grape director), with a ponytail and an Irish accent, compliments her with a rugged look and easygoing charm that makes his fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants character a perfect soulmate for Binoche.I recommend stopping by the candy counter or sneaking in some Fannie May confections before the movie starts.  This film does for chocolate what Big Night did for Italian food. In spite of its flaws, Chocolat makes for a far more rewarding and satisfying film experience than Hollstrom's last feel-gooder, the over-rated Cider House Rules.  In the end, something about this film won me over.  It could have been the irrisistable theme of great food being as close to Godliness as one could get.  It could have been the sights of chocolates being created and turned into glorious, statuesque works of art.  It could have been the enjoyable cast, each member dealing with their hidden anguish and repression.  Or it could have been all of the above, combined with the captivating and alluring grace of Juliette Binoche.We all have our vices.
