There is only one reason this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. Uwe Boll please take up another career. The special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An evening with...) talked about Tim Burton not ever reading the Batman comics and it showed. Uwe Boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. If you two ever want to know how it is done go see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever. Some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at ID had a lot to do with Doom. It doesn't seem like anyone at UBIsoft was even near this production.

There are several conditions which one must abide by in order to enjoy this movie. ONE, forget the game (even though it is good);TWO,watch this movie empty headed/don't take it seriously; THREE, ignore the bad acting. If you can do these things, then you might actually like it. There were several points in the movie where I was laughing so hard, I was crying. The humor was subtle at times and others it was blatant, but it was still funny.Now, with that being said, it wasn't a quality movie by any means. The action scenes were nice, but not awesome; the acting was sub par, especially the lady in the beginning, "But George, I want to see the whales!" This was a part where I was cracking up. Also, the chemistry between Valerie and Jack was, well, interesting. They just sort of, ummm, came together as if they knew each other for a long time. In fact, the character development was the weakest point of the movie, but hey, like I said, condition number two.The ending was good enough, but in the end I felt like nothing was accomplished. It sounds like I hated the movie, but the humor and Shweiger's relaxed feel, even in dire situations, just made this enjoyable. Plus the ending action sequence was cool. Don't watch this if you want a serious, hard core action movie. Watch this if you want to watch a relaxed, not-so-serious movie.Uwe Boll's best video game movie, and the only one worth seeing (renting).

This may be Uwe Boll's best movie ever. No,I'm not a fan. How could I be. Uwe Boll is a director who shows no respect for his audience and doesn't deserve respect when it comes to making movies. He even admitted himself that he does it solely for the money. He is not skilled at all and has got the creativity of an amoeba. But is that a reason for not liking or watching his movies. Well,yes and no. It all comes down to expectation. If you have none than "Far Cry" will surprise you. Til Schweiger is well aware of Boll's reputation and doesn't take it seriously which shows and is one of the strong points of the movie. The second strong element are the action scenes which are actually pretty decent and fun to watch. Does this movie has anything to do with the game? Of course not(OK,maybe 1 or 2 elements are taken from the game). Does it have a good story? Guess again. What about the acting? At least it wasn't completely annoying and Til's Jack Carver was very likable. "Far Cry" is movie that can be fun if you are able to put your brain off.

I'm going to make this short as I don't know much about how to properly review a movie. Seeing how the director behind this movie is Uwe Boll which, as a lot of you probably know, isn't a very well liked guy I'm guessing that a lot of people gave this a 1 on principle alone, some of them even without having seen it imagine. Bearing this in mind and having just seen it I can say that while it's far from the best movie I've seen it isn't horrible. I'd say not worth buying but renting this for a lazy Sunday or something isn't wasted money. The dialogue could be better and there's not much in the way of character development or anything but it has solid action through and through. Final verdict 5.5/10 - Worth Watching.

It's definitely more than 3 when you want to relax. It's not serious movie thou, not even good action one - although the action is fine. I watched it after the game and I think the game has better story. :-) But I simply forgot about the game, watched the simple movie with some action and not exactly believable romance in it, and I was relaxed. Opening scene might be the best part as it looks like sci-fi stuff, but the rest is still OK. Acting is like the movie, probably the romance in the bed is the worst part (although I generally like bed scenes and I'm very forgiving there ;-)), some action parts are way too long (one chase with the mutant) but otherwise it's quite solid average movie based on a simple script without any great idea. The thing that is great about this movie is that it's generally quite smooth and it didn't make me angry like my last bad experience (Flight of the Phoenix http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377062/). No far-fetched scenes, no embarrassing dialogs ("You better be here when I return" :-)), no forced drama. Easy, smooth, flowing average action. There are better movies outside that made me rather unsatisfied because they looked more serious. This is NOT serious even if it's not a comedy. It's simply B class (or C?) action movie. Not a bad one. Probably the missing point is the worst problem - but hey, who would expect a point here?

Deutschlands schlechtester Schauspieler und Regisseur machen einen Film...

Maybe it led people to believe it had something to do with the game franchise, saw it and felt helpless after. But that's not the movie's fault. Even thought the title was poorly chosen it would be wrong to misjudge it for the gaming franchise. Any good action-lover would mark it as a decent watch. It had Til Schweiger and Emmanuelle Vaugier. Also to be mentioned, Craig Fairbass. Udo Kier playing a part in the movie. Follow up his previous films. The movie runs very fast, it doesn't lag. Keeps you engaged and entertained. Why I rated this in its mediocrity is when I saw this had a budget of $30,00,000. It left me shocked with the feeling that it could have done so much better. Where did all that money go? It leaves you wondering and disappointing.

This movie wasn't bad at all. It contains some cheesy dialogs, Jacks English pronunciation was kinda funny. Also that evil woman-soldier acted and talked like terminator... with face without any expression.But... there were nice action scenes, nice explosions and fights. Really good-looking chase with altered super soldier in factory. It contained some parkour elements which seemed pretty refreshing to me.Movie doesn't look cheap and it surprised me, I was expecting total rubbish.Considering FarCry game, many elements in movie were taken from it. Humwees with machine-guns, boats with machine-guns... head-shots. But there were no white sand beach and location wasn't like jungle paradise (which could be seen in game). I haven't seen many movies based on computer games, but I think this one is quite good. Much better than TombRaider, which was trying to be very serious. This movie is light, but not much as Postal... which belongs to another category.

Uwe Boll has an unusual distinction. On IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List, he currently has five movies listed! This is NOT a distinction any normal person would want...though in the case of Boll, somehow studios keep giving him huge budgets, so he's probably laughing all the way to the bank! I have seen his other four entries on the list, "BloodRayne", "House of the Dead", "Alone in the Dark" and "In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale". Why? Because I have an odd obsession....to try to watch all 100 on this everchanging list!"Far Cry" is odd in that Boll bought the rights to this videogame BEFORE the game was even released. He was lucky...the game was a hit. The public, however, wasn't...as the film stank.The plot is pretty simple. Valerie pays Jack to take her to the island where her Uncle Max works. However, after she arrives, the baddies on the island blow up Jack's boat...and he just barely escapes. Apprently Dr. Krieger* is doing evil stuff on this island and he's not allowing anyone to get in his way! But Jack is an ex-special forces guy...and soon it's him versus all of Krieger's brainless and rather indestructable genetically modified minions.A few things you are likely to notice shortly after the film begins. First, it's ultra-violent....not too unusual for Boll's films. Second, most in the cast sound either German OR they put on very fake and stupid accents in order to try to hide this. In particular, the 'American' couple on the whale trip are among the silliest fake-American accented characters I'd ever heard. Apparently Boll didn't notice...but someone should have noticed this. And, considering the film was made in Canada, there surely were some locals who sounded much more like Americans. The film also abounds with dumb writing mistakes and cliches. When Jack attacks one of the baddies, the baddie makes sure NOT to cry out for help (a common but bad cliche), a helicopter explodes for practically no reason at all, Valerie throws a grenade and forgets to pull the pin (is anyone THAT stupid???), after initially evading the baddies the pair (who just met each other) stop to make whoopie (which is odd since they ARE on an island full of folks wanting to kill them), three soldiers firing at Jack at close range with machine guns....yet he takes them all out with his pistol....and that incredible annoying fat guy with the sandwich....uggh! The bottom line is that the film is terribly written and is, at times, an insult to your intelligence...and it often uses violence and action in place of acting and writing.
*I found it funny that the mad German scientist, Krieger, is the same name given to the mad German scientist on "Archer".

First Off. . .this is an Uwe Boll Production, which places it in a category all its own.Having said that-- for a straight to DVD or Grade B- Late night Mad Scientist / Monster romp, it's actually not. . .all that Bad.It's not. . .all that Good either, but it will fill the late hour and a half if you are not yet ready to hit the sack and just wanna watch some low-grade action.Those of you who are avid FarCry players. . .Don't. Just Don't. Play the game, instead. If you DO watch this, don't go cursing or crying to anyone, because you were warned. The Game was far more dark and intense than this movie could ever be.For everyone else, it can be a chuckle-- even though it is NOT a Comedy or a Spoof. But I SWEAR that Udo Keir (Dr. Kreiger) couldn't help himself because he was delivering some ringing one-liners with a deadpan face that was DARING the viewer to laugh.The other actors can be forgiven their emotive trespasses because this is a Mad Scientist / Monster Movie. No-one expects a Oscar nomination out of this, so don't hold it against them. Be fair. Besides, the wooden, cardboard, plastic, ersatz performances of the Lead characters could be EXACTLY what Uwe wanted. Remember: This Man Sees the Cinematic world through a different lens than the rest of us Mortals. He is an Artiste!!!And several reviewers have commented rather 'objectively' on the 'romantic liaison' that both Viewers AND Actors were subjected to. Again: This is Uwe Boll. Romantic scenes are not 'Created' in Uwe's movies; they just happen. They happen without reason, without NEED for reason, like a rock dropped in a puddle, like a stinkbomb exploding in a bowl of jello. . .BOOM! Romantic moment NOW-- Kiss & Fumble and now we're done, on to the next page. . .And in Uwe's favor, upon reflection I note that all the weird Romantic Uwe Moments in all his movies are surprisingly CHASTE. I'm not gonna psycho-analyze that.So like I said, got nothing else to watch on a late Saturday night, but don't wanna hit the sack yet? Slip this DVD in and let your brain lay back and doze.This movie is Totally Girlfriend Friendly. She won't even care.

I don't really mind the creative ideas interjected in these movies, but seriously. There isn't one coherent part of the game in this movie. That seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want. This butchering is almost entertaining because you know you are getting away with hiding behind a lack of skill, and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do this. Play a game, or hire someone to, and please make a real movie, or stand in the boxing ring and have your butt handed to you as you so claim won't happen.wow, 9 lines of text and i was done. had to add blah to bug you, sorry

Nothing special about this one. Uwe Boll gets beaten for several of his movies, so after watching this one i assume he has improved...? The camera work is decent, the action is explosive, the acting is average to poor, the story is predictable, the sex scene is laughable and my low expectations were not disappointed. If you want a cheap action flick, you're not going wrong with this one.For the game pro's in here: This movie is NOT made after "Far Cry: Crysis", but it's predecessor "Far Cry" and only that. Check the box art of both games, Jack Carver was only in the first title and only there you'll see him wearing his infamous Hawaii-shirt.

I am deeply disturbed by some posts I am reading on the message boards for this movie, people saying it is actually a good movie! Just because this movie is Uwe Boll's best to date does not make it a good movie at all, no way in hell! Far Cry is a clichéd mess full of bad acting, poor direction, and an uninspired story with a shoddy script. This is Boll's first pure action movie, and news flash people, action movies aren't too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot, and hey, Mr. Boll succeeds in doing that. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, and Bloodrayne, all horror games adapted into movies by Boll are far worse than this (they have no redeeming qualities). Far Cry boasts two things which make it his best yet: two good leads and a couple of well-done action sequences. Til Schweiger is quite good as Jack Carver, and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female lead. The usually great Udo Kier is passable as the clichéd villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad. Towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering Boll was behind the camera.Unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it, with bad CGI, lame one-liners and clichés around every corner. Oh, and the worst lead up to a sex scene I think I have ever scene. Not only have the two only known each other for six hours, but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by spooning his fellow soldiers. He already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to. Then he took his off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia.Anyway, to summarise, this is a bad movie. It is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored. One could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it, but I'd personally say watch a classic action film like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from this derivative mess.1½/5

There is only one reason this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible.

One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up.The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.Acting wise it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps.While I think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game was hardly Oscar winning just a vehicle for FPS carnage. Would have liked it set in the Jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but Canada doesn't have a great deal of Jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest.Why Boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots I don't know but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. Watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.

There is only one reason this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. Uwe Boll please take up another career.

Up until right now, i have rated Uwe Boll's movies no more than a 4, everything was so poorly written and directed that i couldn't give a better one.On this particular movie though..i had to give him a 5 for trying.He managed to get the best second hand actors around and put out a better display of the movie....for the first part that is.The beginning made me think the movie could be it...the first one to which i could have given an over 7 rating....but from the middle ..it just kept lower and lower.The ending was too dull..no fun for the watcher..]Keep it up Uwe,you might get the chance of scoring a 7 with me for that matter ! Enjoyable B movie (bolded B)!

Deutschlands schlechtester Schauspieler und Regisseur machen einen Film...

i was one "chosen" to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film is based on the video game "far cry", a for its time really good game (2004). second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll. this is a man, who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes movies out of them (VERY horrible ones....).i still remember when i saw boll's "the king's swords: a dungeon siege tail". there were so horrible mistakes in this film (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 at day-time, and one somehow at night.....)so lets come to "far cry". if you expect cool action, forget it. really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far away from real action. if you expect a cool story, forget it. orientating by the not-so-bad story of the game, this movie is a laugh. the actors' playing makes the movie in a lot of moments funny, but in a no-good way.i had the chance to see this movie for free. so do not do the mistake and pay for this trash. its one of my favorised flicks for the bottom 100.!!!!

Mr. "Uwe Fail" strikes again, transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap. Poor acting; Poor Directing; Awful adaptation; I mean, Far-Cry game was awesome, its like a true FPS game, cool weapons and lots lots lots of "point and shoot". In the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. Well we had some of the "point and shoot" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another "Uwe Fail" movie you will understand. If you don't believe me, go to the website "petition online" and do a check for one named "Stop Uwe Bowl".That movie made my eyes bleed, someone must stop him for once.Don't waste your time.

I enjoyed this movie, it was fun and pretty well made. I think that people should watch this movie before rating it. There is no way it's a 3/10, seriously did you even enjoy the snore-fest of Oscar movies released recently? I have to try to stay awake watching movies like the Bicurious case of Benjamin Buttkisser, and don't even get me started on Not so Revolutionary Road. If you still enjoying watching movies that are fun, then you won't have a problem with this. It was made in Vancouver and I'm sure there was more than just one person working on this movie. If your head isn't up your butt then you will get over the fact that Boll was involved, you might even be surprised.

I've never seen a Boll film before but I have heard the rumours. This might be why I thought this wasn't too bad. My expectations were way, way down.However, it wasn't as bad as I feared. Now granted, I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it but it was better than some of the drivel I've seen. This, I could actually sit through and didn't think that I was completely wasting my time.The locations and sets were good, the cinematography not bad, the acting let things down a bit and the writing was very, very ordinary. I even found the references to the game (as little as they were) amusing.

Maybe it led people to believe it had something to do with the game franchise, saw it and felt helpless after. But that's not the movie's fault. Even thought the title was poorly chosen it would be wrong to misjudge it for the gaming franchise. Any good action-lover would mark it as a decent watch. It had Til Schweiger and Emmanuelle Vaugier. Also to be mentioned, Craig Fairbass. Udo Kier playing a part in the movie. Follow up his previous films. The movie runs very fast, it doesn't lag. Keeps you engaged and entertained.

*I found it funny that the mad German scientist, Krieger, is the same name given to the mad German scientist on "Archer".

This film is painful to watch.It starts off with a scene that's supposed to be tense and scary, but the amateur cinematography will throw you off and make you wonder why the hell no one decided to go for a second take.It doesn't get much better from there.The movie plods along at a snails pace, which is especially painful because the characters on display are impossible to care about. They're bland and uninteresting. We're given a lot of scenes that are supposed to act as comic relief, but they just physically hurt. The romance scene between our two lead actors is the most awkward thing in the movie by far.As for the acting, the two leads are passable, as is Udo Kier, but everyone else is so awful that you can hardly believe it.The story isn't great, either. The plot revolves around an island where creepy looking super soldiers are being developed. The "Plot", as it were, is quickly shelved to make way for endless scenes of soldiers shooting each other. I'm not against action-heavy movies. In fact, they can be quite fun when done properly. However, the action on display here is as bland and lifeless as the monsters. There are car chases, boat chases, explosions and endless bullets flying, but it's all so poorly executed and shot that it just numbs the senses and damn near put me to sleep.Honestly, it's hard to think of any redeeming values this film may possess. I can't recommend this movie, not under any circumstances.

I'm not gonna psycho-analyze that.So like I said, got nothing else to watch on a late Saturday night, but don't wanna hit the sack yet? Slip this DVD in and let your brain lay back and doze.This movie is Totally Girlfriend Friendly. She won't even care.

I don't really mind the creative ideas interjected in these movies, but seriously. There isn't one coherent part of the game in this movie. That seems to be the trend, buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want. This butchering is almost entertaining because you know you are getting away with hiding behind a lack of skill, and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do this. Play a game, or hire someone to, and please make a real movie, or stand in the boxing ring and have your butt handed to you as you so claim won't happen.wow, 9 lines of text and i was done. had to add blah to bug you, sorry

Nothing special about this one. Uwe Boll gets beaten for several of his movies, so after watching this one i assume he has improved...? The camera work is decent, the action is explosive, the acting is average to poor, the story is predictable, the sex scene is laughable and my low expectations were not disappointed. If you want a cheap action flick, you're not going wrong with this one.For the game pro's in here: This movie is NOT made after "Far Cry: Crysis", but it's predecessor "Far Cry" and only that. Check the box art of both games, Jack Carver was only in the first title and only there you'll see him wearing his infamous Hawaii-shirt.

I am deeply disturbed by some posts I am reading on the message boards for this movie, people saying it is actually a good movie! Just because this movie is Uwe Boll's best to date does not make it a good movie at all, no way in hell! Far Cry is a clichéd mess full of bad acting, poor direction, and an uninspired story with a shoddy script. This is Boll's first pure action movie, and news flash people, action movies aren't too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot, and hey, Mr. Boll succeeds in doing that. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, and Bloodrayne, all horror games adapted into movies by Boll are far worse than this (they have no redeeming qualities). Far Cry boasts two things which make it his best yet: two good leads and a couple of well-done action sequences. Til Schweiger is quite good as Jack Carver, and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female lead. The usually great Udo Kier is passable as the clichéd villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad. Towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering Boll was behind the camera.Unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it, with bad CGI, lame one-liners and clichés around every corner. Oh, and the worst lead up to a sex scene I think I have ever scene. Not only have the two only known each other for six hours, but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by spooning his fellow soldiers. He already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to. Then he took his off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia.Anyway, to summarise, this is a bad movie. It is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored. One could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it, but I'd personally say watch a classic action film like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from this derivative mess.1½/5

I cant believe some of the bad reviews of this flick. Who cares if it isn't your idea of the game. Rate it as a movie.As a movie it has great action scenes, a very good cast that works well together and decent dialog. Unlike many of the action flicks of late this thing has characters with actual personalities. The two leads work well together and have some on screen chemistry.I don't know anything about the game this is based off and don't care. What does concern me is the quality of the movie, which was excellent. Its nice to see a movie where the characters are interacting with each other instead of spitting lame lines at one another.One more thing, the lead female (Emmanuelle Vaugier), its refreshing to see a hottie that can actually act for change, good job. And Til Schweiger pulls off the gruff action hero role flawlessly.Just check this movie out, it's a great lazy Saturday afternoon flick, you wont regret it. I hope to see a sequel to this with at least the same actors playing the lead male and female roles they really made this movie work.

I went to see this film in the cinema with some friends of mine and we expected the movie to be complete trash. Since Uwe Boll is regarded the worst director ever, we expected to see a stupid, bad, ridiculous action movie with a story hardly good enough for a video game.And this was, what we got.This film will just make you laugh all the time. Not for actual jokes in the movie, but more for the ridiculous characters. Come on, a German ex-elite soldier making his living as a boat-captain in Canada, Meets the niece of another German ex-elite-soldier, who works for an evil, mad, German scientist who is trying to create the new Master-Race of biologically modified soldiers for the US-Military...in Canada. Then there are the stereotype Mercenary, the stereotype Soldiers and the stereotype Monsters.Speaking of ridiculous characters, what exactly is Emilio's role in this film? Still, the action was surprisingly good and the movie all in all was very entertaining. If you want to see art, it's your own fault you didn't like the movie. But if you want to see a movie, too ridiculous to be taken serious, I promise you, you will be fine with "Far Cry"

This was a true B movie without a budget. Why they used the Far Cry name as it does not really do the game franchise any form of justice at all.Mundane acting, poor effects, ridiculous story and overall tiresome to watch.

Okay this is another one of Uwe Boll's game-to-movies. I am pretty sure you should know what to expect but in this case it is a slight step in the right direction. I know what you are thinking.I am crazy but seriously this film is a slight improvement on all of of his game-to-movie adaptations. However slight,an improvement is an improvement.The is about a retired special forces soldier Jack Carver(Til Schweiger) who now ferries people on his boat to the sea for sightseeing. However things take a turn for the worst when an aspiring journalist , Valerie Constantine(Emmanuelle Vaugier), decides to hire him to take her to Dr Krieger's(Udo Kier) island. Where he is testing reanimated soldiers to fight at his command. Of course they both are discovered and destruction and mayhem ensue.The story is of course not too great considering Uwe Boll's making it. There is always a bad thing and a good thing when it comes to a game-to-movie adaptation. In this case it is Far Cry's. First the bad. The convoluted plot is one of the bad points of this film. I mean what kind of government would allow the reanimation of soldiers. Of course again there is that cliché where "they say that they have everything under control but obviously they do not" situation. And now the acting. Til schweiger actually does a decent job at being Jack Carver.Hhe could actually pass of as B-list action hero. However sometimes his accent gets in the way of him feeling like an action hero. And Emmanuelle Vaugier is not really up to her usual standard of acting, lacking any real emotion throughout he film. And the worst actor in this film was probably Chris Coppola. He played Emilio, a cook who is caught in between this whole mess. I am pretty sure he brought in to have some comic relief. But the sad thing is that he is just not funny at all. His jokes come in at all the wrong times. Courtesy of sloppy writing. I if you did not know, he was also in another Uwe Boll movie, Postal , in which he was not funny too. Although that was another good effort by Uwe. He is the kind of guy who tries to be funny but just isn't.And now the good part of the film. The ACTION !!!! Seriously this was probably the only saving grace in the entire film. The fight scenes were nicely choreographed and the shoot outs were pretty cool too. Even the beginning chase scene was well shot. If Uwe Boll has proved anything is that can direct a B-action movie properly if he wanted. He just has to take the initiative. Although he still has a long way more to go and has to improve a lot more if he want to be famous and not notorious for his directing

An unambitious and limited "action" film filled with stupid dialogue, bad jokes, desperate characters, and repetitive and boring sequences of violence.
