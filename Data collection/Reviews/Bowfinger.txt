Steve Martin, the funniest man alive in the 80s, lost his way in the 90s with the likes of "Leap Of Faith" and "A Simple Twist Of Fate".  Now, after sterling work in David Mamet's "The Spanish Prisoner", Martin's return to writing and acting in straight-up comedy is surprisingly, reassuringly good. "Bowfinger" is a movie about movies, with all the potential for in-jokery and self-indulgence that brings, but for the most part dispenses with the clever-clever, isn't-Hollywood-shallow stuff to deliver laughs.Martin's Bobby Bowfinger, a struggling producer desperate for a hit before he reaches the 'unemployable' age of 50, hits on the idea of putting action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) in his new sci-fi film "Chubby Rain" without the star knowing anything about it. Consequently, Bowfinger's inept crew follows Ramsey around in increasingly crazy and surreal fashion, utilising everything from 'Will Work For Food' signs made of foil to cranes mounted on trucks to get the shot they need. When Bowfinger stumbles across a Kit double (Murphy again) who will do anything the director asks including fetch the coffee, he starts to think all his birthdays have come at once. Meanwhile, the neurotic Ramsey, never that stable to begin with, begins to lose it altogether as he becomes convinced that sex-crazed pod people are stalking him.It's a simple plot and, while the script throws a few barbs at Hollywood, it's played mainly for big laughs - and gets them. Heather Graham is spot-on as the ingenue literally just off the bus from Ohio who is prepared to sleep with anyone to get longer scenes, and Jamie Kennedy is all laconic wit as Bowfinger's long-suffering assistant. Really, though, it's Martin and Murphy's show. The original wild and crazy guy shows he hasn't lost all his manic energy in the title role, nor his wit with the sharp script. Surprisingly enough, though, the standout performance is Murphy's; he is brilliant as both the paranoid, highly-strung Kit and his dumb-but-sweet double Jiff. This might even be a career-best.It's simple, lightweight and throwaway of course, but comedies that try to SAY something, even if they're good, often just don't make you laugh that much. Bowfinger will.

Steve Martin has made some fine comedy movies - 'The Man with two Brains' 'All of Me' 'Dirty Rotten Scoudrels' and 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' to name just few. He has also made some wonderfully touching movies like 'A Simple Twist of Fate' where his acting ability really shows through. Unfortunately he does have a knack of making too many films that are merely mediocre or worse; films like 'Mixed Nuts' 'Sgt. Bilko' 'Bringing down the House' and 'Cheaper by the Dozen'I am pleased to say that Bowfinger shows us Steve Martin close to his best; he plays the lead role and he also wrote this totally crazy, unbelievable and madcap comedy; and it is genuinely funny for all the right reasons. It is cleverly written and has a really interesting storyline. I thought it was brilliant fun, and well worth watching.Steve Martin Fans will love this one 7/10

Continuing my plan to watch every Eddie Murphy movie in order, I come to Bowfinger (1999)Plot In A Paragraph: 
A low budget filmmaker (Steve Martin) makes a movie with the biggest action star in the world (Murphy) without his knowledge.For his last movie in the 90's Murphy starred opposite comedy legend Steve Martin and Heather Graham in Frank Oz's under rated Hollywood satire. He plays a big action star and his goofy brother. I remember thinking it was ok when it came out, and then I never watched it again. I enjoyed it so much this morning, I'm probably going to keep it. I laughed out loud a few times. Murphy looks like he is having fun playing dual roles, which he filmed in six weeks between finishing Life and starting Nutty Professor 2. The freeway scene is the funniest thing I have seen in an Eddie Murphy movie for a long time. Incredibly, executives at Universal wanted to cut that scene, because they felt it would be too expensive!! Martin replied he would not cut the funniest scene in the film.This is probably the last time Steve Martin was funny. Heather Graham plays an actress named Daisy, she is allegedly based on Anne Heche. Like Daisy, Heche is from Ohio, was briefly romantically involved with a significantly older man, Steve Martin. Daisy's last lines about being involved with "the most powerful lesbian in Hollywood" are a reference to Heche's relationship at the time with Ellen DeGeneres. Of the rest of the cast, Christine Baranski and Terrance Stamp are both fun whilst Robert Donwey Jr has three scenes. This was a bad time to be a Downey Jr fan. He was out on parole, but was constantly missing regular drug tests, resulting in him going back to prison. It was at this sentencing he famously said of his addictions "It's like I've got a shotgun in my mouth, my finger on the trigger and I like the taste of gun metal."Amazingly this is based on a real life story from 1927. A Russian filmmaker, covertly shot footage of Mary Pickford on holiday, and made a full movie, based around what he had. I remember this opening the same weekend as The Sixth Sense. It got very good reviews, but was not a runaway hit. Which is a shame because it may be the last really funny movie either Murphy or Martin ever starred in.Bowfinger grossed $66 million at the domestic box office (on a $55 million budget) to end the year, the 35th highest grossing movie of 1999.

was actually surprised that BOWFINGER got a mere average rating of 6.4 on this site because the IMDb is full of wannabe film makers who are gonna love a movie satirizing the Hollywood studios , a film both cruel and amusing in turn and it would be very interesting to see how the votes panned out . I'm sort of guessing here that the wannabees awarded it very high marks while the typical Eddie Murphy fans , casual film goers and those people who claim THE MUMMY RETURNS is the greatest film ever ( And no I'm not criticising anyones opinions and tastes ) would have given it relatively low marks . I'm guessing that it's a possibly a film that unfortunately went above a lot of headsFirst off is the title BOWFINGER . What sort of image does that conjure up ? Possibly a James Bond spoof ala AUSTIN POWERS with lots of slapstick ? If you enjoy that sort of schoolboy humour you'll be very disappointed . Likewise if you're an Eddie Murphy fan because Murphy's dual performance is very restrained here and all the better for it . It also has an opposite effect for people who don't like Eddie Murphy ( Or for that matter Steve Martin ) very much but are people not keen on either Murphy or Martin going to watch this in the cinema ? I was very happy that the movie did relatively well on its initial release in 1999 because it certainly had the potential to be a flop at the cinema The premise is very simple: Film producer Bobby Bowfinger ( Martin ) has a knock back from Hollywood star Kit Ramsey ( Murphy ) so Bowfinger decides to secretly film him anyway and edit it into his movie . Thankfully the screenplay of BOWFINGER is developed well enough for maximum comic effect , Bowfinger is making a sci-fi movie so Kit finds himself facing aliens at one point and yes he genuinely believes they are real aliens . Bobby Bowfinger himself seems to have been based on the infamous Ed Wood while watching Kit attend the MindHead classes one is perhaps reminded of John Travolta or Tom Cruise and I don't care what the critics say - Some of the gags like the scene with the dog in the underground car park are laugh out loud funny without ever going OTT All in all a fairly amusing satirical comedy that enjoys taking pokes at the American film industry and certainly one of the better films that have either starred Martin or Murphy

Steve Martin leads a pack of film-making hacks and amateurs in a project that involves filming a major star without his knowledge or consent.Now that the plot is out of the way, the review. It's hard to give this title a 9 or a 10. It's not perfect. There are a few slow passages, but those are few and a placed in such a way that they do not lead to a major train wreck. While the humor is not terribly cerebral, there is so much heart in the story, and the enthusiasm and love for film shines through. By the end, we understand the joy that comes with the film-making process. It's one thing to make a brilliant film, and to be recognized as a wonderful director, but lacking that talent, the joy is not decreased by making an average or poor film by overcoming obstacles and producing a piece of work. The biggest weakness in this film is not in the premise or the acting at all - it's in a few touches of the script that make it a little closer to being predictable. Regardless, if you can get in touch with the love of film presented, a good time is there to be had. If you want your comedies without heart (a la American Pie) then you'll be bored.

I'm no huge fan of Steve Martin, maybe even the complete opposite but I've liked some of Eddie Murphy's earlier movies for example "Nutty Professor". In this movie Eddie Murphy plays two parts, unusually little for a guy like Eddie.  He does so well and he is very funny in the part where he plays Jiff the dork.  The movie is very entertaining and it makes you laugh out loud several times, it shows off two of the most famous comedians Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy from a very good side. They are both placed in parts where they really get a chance to shine. Check this movie out.

Combine Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy in a movie.  How can you go wrong? The surprising answer is "easily, if you have a poor script".  And that's it in a nutshell.  Uninteresting script, uninspired acting by two actors capable of much better and a story that just drags on, though it does have some funny moments. The whole premise of a movie about someone making a movie has been done to death.  Let it rest in peace.

Stage actor turned Grade Z amateur filmmaker:Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is Hollywood's least successful director. When Bowfinger decides to make an ultra low-budget film with the hottest action star:Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). But Bowfinger will filmed his latest protect without Ramsey never knowing that he's in the movie! Bowfinger uses his crew and his actors to act with Rasmey in several scenes to pull the scam off. But Rasmey is actually a paranoid action star, who believes in aliens and other outrageous things. For Bowfinger's ingenious scheme, he decides to use a double for Rasmey, a nerdy look-alike (Also played by Murphy).Directed by Frank Oz (HouseSitter, Little Shop of Horrors-1986, The Stepford Wives-2004) made an wildly funny comedy that is actually based on a real incident in the late 1920's with actress Mary Pickford, which it's hard to be believe. Still, this comedy manages to be quite original and also this is an underrated film. Good supporting cast includes:Heather Graham, Christine Baranski, Jamie Kennedy, Terence Stamp, Adam Alexi-Malle, Kohl Sudduth and Robert Downey, Jr. Murphy is fun in is dual role (especially in the role of the nerdy look-alike). Sharp, funny script by actor:Martin (The Jerk, Roxanne, Shopgirl). (****/*****).

Interesting movie and creative story. It's critics directed to Hollywood are great.
But it's not very funny...And always stereotyping someone with glasses as a dumb and alienated person who never had sex and so on is getting old.
The movie tries to criticize clichés while at the same time perpetuates them.
Not that is a problem if someone is a virgin but the notion that we can tell how the personal lives of others really are just by looking at them is pretty ridiculous and simplistic.

"Bowfinger" is one of the funniest movies I have seen in years.  It works because it allows the laughs to build from the way the characters play off each other's personalities, without becoming puppets of the script.  It is for people who love the movies as well, because that's what it's really about; how the movie industry works on such unlikely coincidences, and how the truly desperate are sometimes successful against their own natures.The movie is basically about a group of folks who want desperately to make a movie, to break into the big time.  They are led by Bobby Bowfinger, of "Bowfinger International Productions", a hack film "studio" in a ramshackle office in an L.A. suburb.  Bowfinger is the right man to head this team; he's unscrupulous, infinitely resourceful, and isn't daunted by the fact that his budget will come from the dollars he saved up each week since he was a kid, stashed in a box in his attic.  He collects his film crew from illegal immigrants trying to cross the border.His accountant has just written a script about aliens hiding in raindrops.  Don't ask, just watch the movie.  The movie is called "Chubby Rain".  Bowfinger wants Hollywood's leading action star, Kit Ramsey, to play the lead.  As Ramsey, Eddie Murphy turns out one of his best performances. Ramsey is wildly egotistical and emotionally unstable to a fault. He is a member of "Mind Head", one of those many Scientologist-like groups, where he goes often to discuss his many insecurities and paranoid fears, like that of, of course, aliens.Naturally, Ramsey refuses to be in the picture.  That doesn't stop Bowfinger.  He comes up with a clever, if risky, idea: follow Ramsey around, shoot him surreptitiously from a distance, using his own actors to play their parts with him, without Ramsey's knowledge.  This leads to many very funny scenes in which Ramsey comes to believe his paranoid fantasies about aliens are in fact real, while the actors in the movie praise Ramsey's "style".Eventually, a stunt double is needed for certain scenes, and a Ramsey look alike, named Jiff, is brought on board.  Jiff is an entirely unique character, played also by Murphy as a slow-witted innocent with a sheepish grin and a nasal voice.  He is lovable and yet annoying at the same time, to Murphy's credit, and a great movie character.I liked a lot of things about the movie, especially the eye it has for the way Hollywood works.  I really enjoyed a scene early on where Bowfinger stages a phony call with a car phone in a restaurant to create an opportunity to pitch his script to a high-powered executive played by Robert Downey, Jr.  Downey is surprised to see the cord dangling from Martin's phone; he may not take him seriously, but he's not likely to forget meeting him.I also liked the way Ramsey complains to his agent about not having a catch phrase the way white action stars have.  His agent points out a scene where he pushes a guy named Cliff off a cliff.  "That's too cerebral for an audience," shouts Ramsey.  "We're making a movie, not a film!"  He points out that in the script he is reading, the letter "k" appears a number of times that is exactly divisible by three, so "KKK" appears "486 times!"What is best about the movie is the way Bowfinger goes for broke, improvising all the way.  He proceeds with a determination fueled by the insane notion that this scheme could actually work.  You have to respect the chutzpah of someone who wants to succeed that badly, even if he bends a few rules along the way.

I saw Bowfinger on an unoriginal video casette but anyway I enjoy it. It is so funny . It's not such a great movie but it's nice and I recomand you to see it because you won't regret it. Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy are a nice couple and they play pretty good. SEE IT !!!

I didn't mind this movie, although I do believe Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin's movies are gradually decreasing in humour. Neither seemed to be too comfortable in their roles throughout the movie, which decreased the natural delivery of humour they both usually possess.At best, worth a look on video.

"Bowfinger"PLOT SPOILERS (If you don't want to know the plot BASIS, do not read; however, there are no spoilers per say)...`Bowfinger' starts out with Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), an unsuccessful movie director who has oddly enough, at his ripe old age of forty-five, never directed a movie. Every week he puts a dollar away into a little tin to save up for his first movie. Well, now he has bills up to here and debts to pay, and some promising actors to satisfy with a script. And he's got the perfect script to make it all come true: `Chubby Rain.' It is about aliens coming down from space in raindrops, hence the name `Chubby Rain.' And Bobby Bowfinger has the perfect man for the film. He can already see the tagline (well, I can, at least): `And there is only one man who can stop them. Only one man who is an instant moneymaker, audience-attractor and action-hero. Kit Ramsey.'Eddie Murphy plays Kit Ramsey, a successful billion-a-film movie star who has been having some paranoid delusions recently. He goes to a therapist whenever he sees these visions, and the therapist calms him. But he has no idea what he is in store for.After Bowfinger tries to contact Kit in an effort to attract him to the `Chubby Rain' script (to no avail, obviously), Bowfinger hatches a ludicrous plan. A plan that might just work. Who says actors need to know that they are in a movie? What if they were just.filmed, staged? What if you sent an actress up to an actor on the street, told the actress what to say, and filmed it. It could come across that the actor she is talking to is part of the movie. And that is exactly what Bobby Bowfinger does. He films Kit without Kit knowing he is filming him (it all sounds so confusing, but it really isn't).But after Bowfinger's actors go up to Kit and speak to him on the street, Kit thinks that the actors are aliens, and his therapist puts him in a secret mental hospital (rehab?) unit.Bobby Bowfinger is left without an actor.So now, the game is on, as Bobby must find a Kit look-a-like. Fortunately for Bobby, he has just found Kit Ramsey's dorky, nerdy twin Jiff: a braces-boasting, gum-chewing, thick-rimmed glasses wearing, loveable freak.But there are more surprises just around the corner for Bobby, as Kit is released from the mental rehab unit and is chased by Bowfinger's actors again, leading to the film's climax. (`Got you, suckas!')Well, now I will evaluate the cast, because the cast of `Bowfinger' is very ensemble.Steve Martin is great in his role as Bowfiner, a hassled director who must resort to an all-time low of filming. But what is great are Martin's dumb-grin expressions throughout the film that make him look like a little child.I have now seen two Eddie Murphy films in two nights: `Bowfinger' and `I Spy,' his performance in both surprising me. In `I Spy' he fit Kelly Robinson like a glove, using his loudmouth antics to full advantage, for once. In `Bowfinger,' Murphy uses his talent to his full advantage as well, convincingly pulling off an egotistical actor and nerdy geek.Heather Graham plays an actress wannabe who sleeps with every man on set of the movie to get her way(s).Robert Downey, Jr. has a small role as a film producer; he is in the film in the very beginning, about five seconds in the middle, and at the very end. I'd estimate his screen presence at about four minutes total.Jamie Kennedy plays Bobby Bowfinger's assistant and friend; he works in a back-lot film studio. To help film the `Chubby Rain' movie, Kennedy's character `borrows' film equipment from the film studio and returns it to them before night. Kennedy was very good in this movie, as he is in his television show `JKX' (The Jamie Kennedy Experiment).Now, on to the interesting aspects of the film:`Bowfinger' has some very interesting and hilarious sequences, including one segment where Bowfinger is having Kit run across a traffic-packed highway during rush hour for the movie he is filming. Hands down the best scene in the film.The movie also has some interesting `con' ideas, which are very provocative and thought provoking. For instance, Bowfinger sets a camera in a large tree-clipper truck, sets Kennedy up there, drives on a highway and films Kit Ramsey in his car, who is being chased by one of Bowfinger's actors. Who would ever think of that? Only Steve Martin, the writer of this film.The thing that makes this movie so funny is the fact that Kit Ramsey has no clue whatsoever about what is going on. One of Bowfinger's actors (the guy who wrote the `Chubby Rain' script) walks up to Kit and, using a special prank, cuts off his own arm (of course it's a fake arm, but Kit thinks it is real and runs away).Unfortunately, believe it or not, I was overall a bit disappointed in the movie. Yes, it is a clever parody of the film industry, and it was not a bad film at all. It was quite funny. But frankly, I was expecting more laughs after reading so many good reviews and finding out Martin wrote the script.
3/5 stars -John Ulmer

A movie about making a movie that Steve Martin's character is the directs a story without the knowledge of Eddie Murphy's character. Such a wonderful silly entertaining experience created by Frank Oz; such a legend! Heather Graham is so beautiful especially when she kisses Bowfinger. I didn't get much sleep last night I'm spaced out but I love Bowfinger, sorry for my clunky review.

After ANALYZE THIS, another comedy highly praised in the States revealed to be flat and not very funny at all.  I've never been a huge fan of either messrs. Martin or Murphy, so I was surprised to find myself at the film at all; but the reviews wree good, and Heather Graham.  The film aims to please on three levels - as comedy; as character study; and as a film about film-making - but fails on all counts.  Actually fail is too strong a word - the film's irritating self-satisfaction never allows for anything as grand as ambition.As a comedy there are simply not enough laughs.  With the possible exception of ROXANNE, I have never gotten the point of Steve Martin, and, as both comedian and scriptwriter, he rarely rises above the obvious here.  The jokes lack teeth - and while the film's lack of the Gothic melodrama which weakens many of the great films about Hollywood (e.g. SUNSET BOULEVARD), by taking it as seriously as it would like - the lack of any real trauma (surely the essence of all great comedy) makes what is essentially a series of loosely cohered sketches rather lame and lifeless.The film severely sags when Eddie Murphy isn't on the screen (I never thought I'd write that), and it's hardly a (double) role that taxes him. His nerd is particularly funny, even if he is the film's pivot into dreaded sentimentality.  The antics of low-budget film crews have been done so much funnier elsewhere (e.g. LIVING IN OBLIVION, a film intimate with nightmare), but Graham shows what a great comedienne she is becoming, and what a knockout she'll be when somebody gives her a character and a decent script.If the film is indifferent as comedy, it is a complete flop as character study.  Martin is a blank - we get no idea as to what drives him to make films.  Like the hero of ED WOOD, his woeful incompetence is compared to the towering, equally struggling, genius of Orson Welles (there is a poster of TOUCH OF EVIL in his house), but whereas Wood's genuine enthusiasm and love poignantly matched the great man's, Bowfinger seems little more that a cynical opportunist.Even this might have been interesting, but Martin doesn't pursue it. Bowfinger's past and private life is equally a void.  He has seemingly been making Z-grade films for a long time, but do people like that exist anymore? Don't they make adult films?  He lives alone with his dog.  He doesn't do the dishes.  He may have had a relationship in the past with the leading lady, it's not clear.  We don't know how he met up with his buddy the car guy.  His supposedly persuasive charm is anything but.The other characters do not rise above caricatures.  Murphy gives more of an impersonation than a performance.  The brother is probably the more believable of the two, but is really only used for cheap laughs.  Kit Ramsey, the action star paranoid at an anti-black conspiracy confiding in a very white Mindhead guru is only amusing as a plot excuse rather than a person.  Martin's misogyny is clearly revealed in Graham's part, which she gives more complexity than it deserves.As a film about filmmaking, BOWFINGER has pretensions to two films - IRMA VEP and the aforementioned ED WOOD, but lacks the former's belief in the transcendent power of cinema, or the melancholy cheerfulness of the latter. It's hard to believe in a film avowing an imdependent spirit that stars Eddie Murphy.  The film is pure Hollywood, the little man who against the odds becomes a (relative)success.  There is never any real danger of this not happening, or if there were we wouldn't care because the characters aren't interesting enough.  The supposed confusions of Bowfinger's kind of guerilla filmmaking are cosily tidied up in slick direction and a pat script.By its very subject matter, the film raises issues such as authenticity, reproduction, authoriality, as well as the integrity of Hollywood (!), or any collaborative product, but doesn't do anything very meaningful with them.  Like VEP, though, I have to admit that there is a certain magic in seeing such a low-budget travesty as the filming of Ramsey in the car lot, transformed into something approaching magic.  But Bowfinger doesn't want to make films anymore than Ramsey does - he wants to make movies, have lunches with powerful producers, attend all-star premieres.  The dash of sentimentality towards the end is so unpalatable because it is so sickly and unearned.  Martin might be a very clever man, but he is not a cinematic thinker like Assayas or Burton - he has no idea why people love movies, and need to make them.  BOWFINGER is quite funny, but do yourself a favour and watch a real, troubled, film like ED WOOD or IRMA VEP instead.

This was one of Martin's lesser films. While Martin invariably invested a lot of himself into this production, as always, I found it less interesting than most of his other endeavors. Co-starring Eddie Murphy, Jamie Kennedy, Heather Graham, and Christine Baranski, I felt most of their wonderful talents went unused, untapped, and uncalled-for. This script simply did nothing to challenge these marvelous actors. And yet, Martin still manages to shine from within the boundaries of this dreary, seemingly low budget production. With a budget of $55 M, direction by Frank Oz, and a screen play by Martin himself, I really expected a lot more from this film.Honestly, they spent $55 M to make a movie about the making of a "B" movie for $2,184.00?! I would have to guess, since IMDb does not show his salary for this film, that at least 10-15 M of the total budget went towards the salary of Mr. Murphy, considering he was paid $20 M for The Klumps 2 PLUS 20% of the movie's gross, according to IMDb. That is sad in itself, but the finished product is so much less than the sum of its parts that it leaves you wondering where IS the movie? While it was fun to watch, this project just did not "work." Good actors, great direction, a good budget, all basically gone up in smoke.While this is still an enjoyable film, I must admit I was far more than a tad disappointed in the finished product. The premise was good, but I honestly believe this movie was such a let down due to the actors' inability to switch out of "B" mode when not in the Chubby Rain phase of this movie. It is like once they got started playing "B" quality characters, they forgot to go back to "A" movie characters when not behind the camera...behind the camera. Confused yet? That is kind of the point. It is so muddled that I believe the actors got confused and Frank Oz forgot to help them keep it together.As a desperate movie producer, Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) must get a movie going, or go under. He takes a really bad script, and attempts to attract talent to the work. When that proves unsuccessful, he dupes his entire staff into believing Kitt Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) has agreed to do the movie, but has a radical "acting style," where he films his scenes on the fly. So Bowfinger begins filming his movie, starring Kitt Ramsey, unbeknownst to Mr. Ramsey. It's a clever and funny idea, but somewhere in the mix, it just gets lost. And yet, I still like and OWN this movie. There is an appeal, but I could not tell you what that appeal is, anymore than I can tell you why it does not work. I have watched this movie again to write this review, and I still have the same mixed feelings about it. See it for yourself, and you be the judge.It rates a 4.2/10 from...the Fiend :.

The remarkable thing about this film is that hardly ever has Steve Martin ever been so genuinely sympathetic without seeming clumsy about it. Believe me, this movie could have been over in the first few minutes if the writing hadn't started out so deliciously cynical. Immediately, I was hooked by the story of this downtrodden dreamer who endeavors to commit his life's savings to a hopeless cause. Forget about the weak (tacked-on) ending and the craziness for comedy's sake. This is a light character study worthy of a filmlover's earnest attention. Kudos to Murphy for the dual role-one a loving tribute to his inner child and the other a biting satire of his public image.

You know a movie is terrible when the best performance is given by the dog. Bravo, pooch.  The rest of you, hang your heads in shame.I've been wondering why I found Eddie Murphy so funny when I was 13.  It's finally hit me--it's BECAUSE I was 13.  Now that the numbers are reversed, his act has gotten tremendously stale.A bad movie about making a bad movie.  The only saving grace is that my roommate paid for the rental.

Given Tom Cruise's recent unstable behavior, it might be the right time to revisit 'Bowfinger,' Steve Martin and Frank Oz's highly under-appreciated satire of the side of Hollywood we mere mortals aren't supposed to see.In Hollywood, there are no secrets--everyone knows who's secretly gay or insane, and who's slept with who, when, where, and what they got out of it. But no one wants powerful enemies, and in the quickly shifting landscape of stardom, where one can transform almost overnight and with no apparent or predictable logic from b-list character actor or teen idol into a-list mega-star and Oscar-caliber actor who can open hundred-million dollar movies and make or break the careers of his/her friends and acquaintances, no one wants to be the one who spills the scandalous beans.For this reason, 'Bowfinger'--the 'Spinal Tap' of contemporary Hollywood--was barely made, and upon its release was greeted with a politely, barely restrained gasp of horror from everyone on the inside who recognized Martin's unusually liberal borrowings from the gossip files to construct this smart, dry, tastefully executed comedy about a has-been-before-he-ever-was actor/director who concocts a scheme to sell his hopelessly bad sci-fi action film project to a major studio by surreptitiously following and filming a major action film star, manipulating his behavior when able, and then later patching a film together with the clandestine footage and a few shots with a body-double. Little does Bowfinger (the loser, played with typical charm and intelligence by the great Steve Martin) know that the film star he means to exploit--Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy)--is a paranoid, delusional basket case of psychological problems barely being held together (though, one suspects, also being held at the edge of sanity) by his mentors at MindHead, a bizarre, cultish, mind-controlling religion obviously meant to stand in for the Church of Scientology, the increasingly infamous faith/life method of numerous Hollywood stars, most notoriously Tom Cruise and John Travolta (musician Beck has allegedly also recently joined the ranks of Scientology, at the behest of his father and his girlfriend, the sister of actor Giovanni Ribisi, also a Scientologist).Bowfinger assembles a motley crew of Hollywood wannabes, which include the fabulous Christine Baranski as Carol, an aging stage actress who drives around town listening to old recordings of herself singing show tunes; Heather Graham as Daisy, a presumably naive young beauty who steps off the bus in L.A. and immediately sets about trying to sleep her way to the top (Daisy is based on nutso actress Anne Heche, who exploited Martin before moving up the food chain to a public lesbian affair with Ellen Degeneres, whose sit-com was then at peak popularity); Adam Alexi-Malle as Afrim, Bowfinger's corpulent Pakistani accountant and the author of 'Chubby Rain,' the ludicrous alien invasion script which Bowfinger believes will catapult him to fame and respectability; Jamie Kennedy as Bowfinger's camera operator, who smuggles equipment out of the studio lot where he works as a low-level crew man; and Kohl Sudduth as Bowfinger's sweet but vapid excuse for a heart-throb. This gang of misfits works well together in various gags lampooning the film industry.But the film is stolen entirely by Eddie Murphy, first as Kit Ramsey, whose paranoid rants include the observation that a script his agent has offered him must be racist because the letter 'k' appears in it a number of times divisible by three ('KKK' appears in this script 111 times!) and the twisting of a remark made by the agent about a script--'it's not Shakespeare'--into a racist slur ('Shakespeare?!? Shake-a-Spear! You callin' me a spear-chucker!?!), and later as Jiff, Kit's nerdy and socially inept twin brother, who unwittingly stumbles into Bowfinger's scheme and agrees both to serve as a stunt/body double and errand boy for the film ('Running errands would be a real boost for me!' he gleefully remarks).One of the great things about 'Bowfinger' is the opportunity to see Eddie Murphy create two ridiculous characters the way he once did so frequently on Saturday Night Live, before 'Bevery Hills Cop' send his ego to Mars. He looks like he's having the time of his life, and the fabulous talent he has wasted so frequently on mediocre to painfully bad star vehicles like 'Coming to America,' 'Harlem Nights,' or 'Vampire in Brooklyn' is once again apparent, and triumphant. Together, Martin and Murphy remind us how comedy should be made: with intelligence, humility, generosity--and, most importantly, scathing wit.Scientology gets fairly merciless treatment in the form of MindHead, a cult-like corporate religion led by Terry Stricter (Terence Stamp), who soothes the paranoiac Kit with new-agey acronym lessons (K.I.T=Keep It Together) and chastens him not to 'show it to the Laker Girls' when he hears the voice of Teddy Kennedy instructing him to 'bring the Laker Girls down a peg or two.' Given Tom Cruise's recent weirdness and the fact that he openly travels with a cadre of Scientologists who function like a Secret Service detail, it's not hard to suspect that Kit Ramsey was written with Tom Cruise in mind (the role was originally written for Keanu Reeves but was ultimately changed and offered to Murphy).Murphy's presence, ironically, may have undermined this film in its initial release, as audiences many audiences left theaters disappointed, having expected more of a traditional slapstick comedy with Murphy in a larger role (his scenes are easily the funniest, but Kit and Jiff or secondary characters). But it's well worth revisiting for its quality and its scathing critique of the business of Hollywood.

Steve Martin scored a bullseye with BOWFINGER, a smart and cleverly mounted comedy, which Martin also wrote, which stars Steve Martin as Bobby Bowfinger, a down and out Hollywood producer on the verge of going out of business who gets hold of a script to produce and wants big time action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to star in it. When Ramsey won't give Bobby the time of day. Bobby decides to shoot the film without Kit's knowledge or consent. This premise is a wonderful set-up for some very funny sight gags. Eddie Murphy is on target as Kit Ramsey and as a milquetoast lookalike hired to do Ramsey's stunt work and close-ups. Murphy delivers one of his funniest performances as the lookalike and there are other effective contributions from Heather Graham, Jamie Kennedy, Christine Baranski,Terrence Stamp, and Robert Downey, Jr. A smart and winning comedy about the inner workings of modern Hollywood with a great screenplay and starring performance by Martin and Eddie Murphy in the dual role of a lifetime.

After seeing how good the combination of director Frank Oz and actor Steve Martin was in "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," I wasn't surprised that the two would make "Bowfinger" interesting, too. It's not the caliber of "Scoundrels," but it's still fun to watch.Eddie Murphy, as usual, is responsible for a lot of laughs as he plays two characters: this paranoid New Age-type follower and a very nerdy stand-in actor. In both roles, he's effective. Terrence Stamp, meanwhile, does his normal intense job of acting as the leader of a far-out "mind group" that one of Murphy's characters belongs. Heather Graham provides the sex appeal. Few women have made the transition from wholesome country girl to sleazeball in one movie as Graham does here. It's shocking but laughable at the same time, which pretty much describes this odd film. Nice to see Steve Martin back in form, too.

Steve Martin, the funniest man alive in the 80s, lost his way in the 90s with the likes of "Leap Of Faith" and "A Simple Twist Of Fate".  Now, after sterling work in David Mamet's "The Spanish Prisoner", Martin's return to writing and acting in straight-up comedy is surprisingly, reassuringly good. "Bowfinger" is a movie about movies, with all the potential for in-jokery and self-indulgence that brings, but for the most part dispenses with the clever-clever, isn't-Hollywood-shallow stuff to deliver laughs.Martin's Bobby Bowfinger, a struggling producer desperate for a hit before he reaches the 'unemployable' age of 50, hits on the idea of putting action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) in his new sci-fi film "Chubby Rain" without the star knowing anything about it. Consequently, Bowfinger's inept crew follows Ramsey around in increasingly crazy and surreal fashion, utilising everything from 'Will Work For Food' signs made of foil to cranes mounted on trucks to get the shot they need. When Bowfinger stumbles across a Kit double (Murphy again) who will do anything the director asks including fetch the coffee, he starts to think all his birthdays have come at once. Meanwhile, the neurotic Ramsey, never that stable to begin with, begins to lose it altogether as he becomes convinced that sex-crazed pod people are stalking him.It's a simple plot and, while the script throws a few barbs at Hollywood, it's played mainly for big laughs - and gets them. Heather Graham is spot-on as the ingenue literally just off the bus from Ohio who is prepared to sleep with anyone to get longer scenes, and Jamie Kennedy is all laconic wit as Bowfinger's long-suffering assistant. Really, though, it's Martin and Murphy's show. The original wild and crazy guy shows he hasn't lost all his manic energy in the title role, nor his wit with the sharp script. Surprisingly enough, though, the standout performance is Murphy's; he is brilliant as both the paranoid, highly-strung Kit and his dumb-but-sweet double Jiff. This might even be a career-best.It's simple, lightweight and throwaway of course, but comedies that try to SAY something, even if they're good, often just don't make you laugh that much. Bowfinger will.

Steve Martin has made some fine comedy movies - 'The Man with two Brains' 'All of Me' 'Dirty Rotten Scoudrels' and 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' to name just few. He has also made some wonderfully touching movies like 'A Simple Twist of Fate' where his acting ability really shows through. Unfortunately he does have a knack of making too many films that are merely mediocre or worse; films like 'Mixed Nuts' 'Sgt. Bilko' 'Bringing down the House' and 'Cheaper by the Dozen'I am pleased to say that Bowfinger shows us Steve Martin close to his best; he plays the lead role and he also wrote this totally crazy, unbelievable and madcap comedy; and it is genuinely funny for all the right reasons. It is cleverly written and has a really interesting storyline. I thought it was brilliant fun, and well worth watching.Steve Martin Fans will love this one 7/10

Continuing my plan to watch every Eddie Murphy movie in order, I come to Bowfinger (1999)Plot In A Paragraph: 
A low budget filmmaker (Steve Martin) makes a movie with the biggest action star in the world (Murphy) without his knowledge.For his last movie in the 90's Murphy starred opposite comedy legend Steve Martin and Heather Graham in Frank Oz's under rated Hollywood satire. He plays a big action star and his goofy brother. I remember thinking it was ok when it came out, and then I never watched it again. I enjoyed it so much this morning, I'm probably going to keep it. I laughed out loud a few times. Murphy looks like he is having fun playing dual roles, which he filmed in six weeks between finishing Life and starting Nutty Professor 2. The freeway scene is the funniest thing I have seen in an Eddie Murphy movie for a long time. Incredibly, executives at Universal wanted to cut that scene, because they felt it would be too expensive!! Martin replied he would not cut the funniest scene in the film.This is probably the last time Steve Martin was funny. Heather Graham plays an actress named Daisy, she is allegedly based on Anne Heche. Like Daisy, Heche is from Ohio, was briefly romantically involved with a significantly older man, Steve Martin. Daisy's last lines about being involved with "the most powerful lesbian in Hollywood" are a reference to Heche's relationship at the time with Ellen DeGeneres. Of the rest of the cast, Christine Baranski and Terrance Stamp are both fun whilst Robert Donwey Jr has three scenes. This was a bad time to be a Downey Jr fan. He was out on parole, but was constantly missing regular drug tests, resulting in him going back to prison. It was at this sentencing he famously said of his addictions "It's like I've got a shotgun in my mouth, my finger on the trigger and I like the taste of gun metal."Amazingly this is based on a real life story from 1927. A Russian filmmaker, covertly shot footage of Mary Pickford on holiday, and made a full movie, based around what he had. I remember this opening the same weekend as The Sixth Sense. It got very good reviews, but was not a runaway hit. Which is a shame because it may be the last really funny movie either Murphy or Martin ever starred in.Bowfinger grossed $66 million at the domestic box office (on a $55 million budget) to end the year, the 35th highest grossing movie of 1999.

One of Steve Martin's best movies, and one of Eddie Murphy's best too. This has several laugh out loud moments.Plot In A Paragraph: Hollywood, today: Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) a down on his luck actor-producer-director, has a script which a friend has written. Completely convinced of its quality, he decides to take a last shot at fame and fortune. A famous producer(Robert Downey Jr) promises him to do it, but there is one condition: Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) Hollywood's number one star, has to be in it. So, Bobby tries his luck with Kit, who rejects him, so he then decides to shoot the film himself. Featuring an aspiring beauty from Ohio (Heather Graham) and Kit Ramsey - who does not even know he's being filmed.

was actually surprised that BOWFINGER got a mere average rating of 6.4 on this site because the IMDb is full of wannabe film makers who are gonna love a movie satirizing the Hollywood studios , a film both cruel and amusing in turn and it would be very interesting to see how the votes panned out . I'm sort of guessing here that the wannabees awarded it very high marks while the typical Eddie Murphy fans , casual film goers and those people who claim THE MUMMY RETURNS is the greatest film ever ( And no I'm not criticising anyones opinions and tastes ) would have given it relatively low marks . I'm guessing that it's a possibly a film that unfortunately went above a lot of headsFirst off is the title BOWFINGER . What sort of image does that conjure up ? Possibly a James Bond spoof ala AUSTIN POWERS with lots of slapstick ? If you enjoy that sort of schoolboy humour you'll be very disappointed . Likewise if you're an Eddie Murphy fan because Murphy's dual performance is very restrained here and all the better for it . It also has an opposite effect for people who don't like Eddie Murphy ( Or for that matter Steve Martin ) very much but are people not keen on either Murphy or Martin going to watch this in the cinema ? I was very happy that the movie did relatively well on its initial release in 1999 because it certainly had the potential to be a flop at the cinema The premise is very simple: Film producer Bobby Bowfinger ( Martin ) has a knock back from Hollywood star Kit Ramsey ( Murphy ) so Bowfinger decides to secretly film him anyway and edit it into his movie . Thankfully the screenplay of BOWFINGER is developed well enough for maximum comic effect , Bowfinger is making a sci-fi movie so Kit finds himself facing aliens at one point and yes he genuinely believes they are real aliens . Bobby Bowfinger himself seems to have been based on the infamous Ed Wood while watching Kit attend the MindHead classes one is perhaps reminded of John Travolta or Tom Cruise and I don't care what the critics say - Some of the gags like the scene with the dog in the underground car park are laugh out loud funny without ever going OTT All in all a fairly amusing satirical comedy that enjoys taking pokes at the American film industry and certainly one of the better films that have either starred Martin or Murphy

Steve Martin leads a pack of film-making hacks and amateurs in a project that involves filming a major star without his knowledge or consent.Now that the plot is out of the way, the review. It's hard to give this title a 9 or a 10. It's not perfect. There are a few slow passages, but those are few and a placed in such a way that they do not lead to a major train wreck. While the humor is not terribly cerebral, there is so much heart in the story, and the enthusiasm and love for film shines through. By the end, we understand the joy that comes with the film-making process. It's one thing to make a brilliant film, and to be recognized as a wonderful director, but lacking that talent, the joy is not decreased by making an average or poor film by overcoming obstacles and producing a piece of work. The biggest weakness in this film is not in the premise or the acting at all - it's in a few touches of the script that make it a little closer to being predictable. Regardless, if you can get in touch with the love of film presented, a good time is there to be had. If you want your comedies without heart (a la American Pie) then you'll be bored.

I'm no huge fan of Steve Martin, maybe even the complete opposite but I've liked some of Eddie Murphy's earlier movies for example "Nutty Professor". In this movie Eddie Murphy plays two parts, unusually little for a guy like Eddie.  He does so well and he is very funny in the part where he plays Jiff the dork.  The movie is very entertaining and it makes you laugh out loud several times, it shows off two of the most famous comedians Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy from a very good side. They are both placed in parts where they really get a chance to shine. Check this movie out.

Combine Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy in a movie.  How can you go wrong? The surprising answer is "easily, if you have a poor script".  And that's it in a nutshell.  Uninteresting script, uninspired acting by two actors capable of much better and a story that just drags on, though it does have some funny moments. The whole premise of a movie about someone making a movie has been done to death.  Let it rest in peace.

Stage actor turned Grade Z amateur filmmaker:Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is Hollywood's least successful director. When Bowfinger decides to make an ultra low-budget film with the hottest action star:Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). But Bowfinger will filmed his latest protect without Ramsey never knowing that he's in the movie! Bowfinger uses his crew and his actors to act with Rasmey in several scenes to pull the scam off. But Rasmey is actually a paranoid action star, who believes in aliens and other outrageous things. For Bowfinger's ingenious scheme, he decides to use a double for Rasmey, a nerdy look-alike (Also played by Murphy).Directed by Frank Oz (HouseSitter, Little Shop of Horrors-1986, The Stepford Wives-2004) made an wildly funny comedy that is actually based on a real incident in the late 1920's with actress Mary Pickford, which it's hard to be believe. Still, this comedy manages to be quite original and also this is an underrated film. Good supporting cast includes:Heather Graham, Christine Baranski, Jamie Kennedy, Terence Stamp, Adam Alexi-Malle, Kohl Sudduth and Robert Downey, Jr. Murphy is fun in is dual role (especially in the role of the nerdy look-alike). Sharp, funny script by actor:Martin (The Jerk, Roxanne, Shopgirl). (****/*****).

Interesting movie and creative story. It's critics directed to Hollywood are great.
But it's not very funny...And always stereotyping someone with glasses as a dumb and alienated person who never had sex and so on is getting old.
The movie tries to criticize clichés while at the same time perpetuates them.
Not that is a problem if someone is a virgin but the notion that we can tell how the personal lives of others really are just by looking at them is pretty ridiculous and simplistic.

I found this movie to be a disappointment, especially considering that both Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy were co-starring.The lead character in Bowfinger is director Bobby Bowfinger (Martin).  After reading a script for a new movie, "Chubby Rain" (you don't want to know), Bowfinger decides that a major star would make the hoped-for film a success. He would like to cast action star Kit Ramsey (Murphy), but Ramsey is not interested.  He attempts then to film Ramsey anyway, that is, without Ramsey knowing.  Sound dumb?  Yes, it is.  And not that funny either.A fourth of the way into the movie I wished I had wandered into a different auditorium of the multiplex.  By the end, I wanted my money back.  After a funny start (an unseen telephone bill collector tells Bowfinger that it is not necessary to visit a home to cut off phone service), the movie lapses into silliness that I didn't find amusing at all, particularly so after all the media hype.  I should have known that I was in trouble after the opening credits list Steve Martin as writer. A good and talented comedy actor he is, but a writer, he is not. Save your money and wait for it to come out on video.  The big screen is wasted on this effort.

"Bowfinger" is one of the funniest movies I have seen in years.  It works because it allows the laughs to build from the way the characters play off each other's personalities, without becoming puppets of the script.  It is for people who love the movies as well, because that's what it's really about; how the movie industry works on such unlikely coincidences, and how the truly desperate are sometimes successful against their own natures.The movie is basically about a group of folks who want desperately to make a movie, to break into the big time.  They are led by Bobby Bowfinger, of "Bowfinger International Productions", a hack film "studio" in a ramshackle office in an L.A. suburb.  Bowfinger is the right man to head this team; he's unscrupulous, infinitely resourceful, and isn't daunted by the fact that his budget will come from the dollars he saved up each week since he was a kid, stashed in a box in his attic.  He collects his film crew from illegal immigrants trying to cross the border.His accountant has just written a script about aliens hiding in raindrops.  Don't ask, just watch the movie.  The movie is called "Chubby Rain".  Bowfinger wants Hollywood's leading action star, Kit Ramsey, to play the lead.  As Ramsey, Eddie Murphy turns out one of his best performances. Ramsey is wildly egotistical and emotionally unstable to a fault. He is a member of "Mind Head", one of those many Scientologist-like groups, where he goes often to discuss his many insecurities and paranoid fears, like that of, of course, aliens.Naturally, Ramsey refuses to be in the picture.  That doesn't stop Bowfinger.  He comes up with a clever, if risky, idea: follow Ramsey around, shoot him surreptitiously from a distance, using his own actors to play their parts with him, without Ramsey's knowledge.  This leads to many very funny scenes in which Ramsey comes to believe his paranoid fantasies about aliens are in fact real, while the actors in the movie praise Ramsey's "style".Eventually, a stunt double is needed for certain scenes, and a Ramsey look alike, named Jiff, is brought on board.  Jiff is an entirely unique character, played also by Murphy as a slow-witted innocent with a sheepish grin and a nasal voice.  He is lovable and yet annoying at the same time, to Murphy's credit, and a great movie character.I liked a lot of things about the movie, especially the eye it has for the way Hollywood works.  I really enjoyed a scene early on where Bowfinger stages a phony call with a car phone in a restaurant to create an opportunity to pitch his script to a high-powered executive played by Robert Downey, Jr.  Downey is surprised to see the cord dangling from Martin's phone; he may not take him seriously, but he's not likely to forget meeting him.I also liked the way Ramsey complains to his agent about not having a catch phrase the way white action stars have.  His agent points out a scene where he pushes a guy named Cliff off a cliff.  "That's too cerebral for an audience," shouts Ramsey.  "We're making a movie, not a film!"  He points out that in the script he is reading, the letter "k" appears a number of times that is exactly divisible by three, so "KKK" appears "486 times!"What is best about the movie is the way Bowfinger goes for broke, improvising all the way.  He proceeds with a determination fueled by the insane notion that this scheme could actually work.  You have to respect the chutzpah of someone who wants to succeed that badly, even if he bends a few rules along the way.

I saw Bowfinger on an unoriginal video casette but anyway I enjoy it. It is so funny . It's not such a great movie but it's nice and I recomand you to see it because you won't regret it. Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy are a nice couple and they play pretty good. SEE IT !!!

I didn't mind this movie, although I do believe Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin's movies are gradually decreasing in humour. Neither seemed to be too comfortable in their roles throughout the movie, which decreased the natural delivery of humour they both usually possess.At best, worth a look on video.

To fans of both Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, this movie promised to be the pinnacle of comedy entertainment, and fell short.  Although both actors are very funny in the film, they're rarely funny together.Despite what the previews allow you to believe, Murphy spends much more time in the movie playing Kit Ramsey (the actor) than Jiff Ramsey (the oafish brother).  This is good in many respects.  I found Kit, who is on the verge of breakdown, much funnier than his simpleton substitute.  However, since the whole movie is about Bobby Bowfinger's inability to get Kit in his film without covert filming, this denies any opportunity for those two characters to meet.  As for scenes with Bowfinger and Jiff, you'll probably find the scenes with Daisy (Heater Graham) funnier, even without the added sex appeal.The movie is still extremely funny, especially if you enjoy the occasional silly humor.  The entire cast, not just the two poster-boys, set up hilarious situation after hilarious situation.Low point: the second-to-last scene with the Fed-Ex delivery.  It seemed to set up for a joke that never came; the humor was apparently supposed to be in the over-dramatization.  I'll never know how much Fed-Ex paid the filmmakers, but I had never been so put-off by movie commercialism since Bond turned down Aston-Martin for BMW.High point: the final scene.  If you enjoy a little silliness to go with your movie, then this should redeem most of the low-points.Overall, this movie is more like watching two screens, one with a Steve Martin movie and one with Eddie Murphy.  But both movies will be hilarious. (7/10)

"Bowfinger"PLOT SPOILERS (If you don't want to know the plot BASIS, do not read; however, there are no spoilers per say)...`Bowfinger' starts out with Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), an unsuccessful movie director who has oddly enough, at his ripe old age of forty-five, never directed a movie. Every week he puts a dollar away into a little tin to save up for his first movie. Well, now he has bills up to here and debts to pay, and some promising actors to satisfy with a script. And he's got the perfect script to make it all come true: `Chubby Rain.' It is about aliens coming down from space in raindrops, hence the name `Chubby Rain.' And Bobby Bowfinger has the perfect man for the film. He can already see the tagline (well, I can, at least): `And there is only one man who can stop them. Only one man who is an instant moneymaker, audience-attractor and action-hero. Kit Ramsey.'Eddie Murphy plays Kit Ramsey, a successful billion-a-film movie star who has been having some paranoid delusions recently. He goes to a therapist whenever he sees these visions, and the therapist calms him. But he has no idea what he is in store for.After Bowfinger tries to contact Kit in an effort to attract him to the `Chubby Rain' script (to no avail, obviously), Bowfinger hatches a ludicrous plan. A plan that might just work. Who says actors need to know that they are in a movie? What if they were just.filmed, staged? What if you sent an actress up to an actor on the street, told the actress what to say, and filmed it. It could come across that the actor she is talking to is part of the movie. And that is exactly what Bobby Bowfinger does. He films Kit without Kit knowing he is filming him (it all sounds so confusing, but it really isn't).But after Bowfinger's actors go up to Kit and speak to him on the street, Kit thinks that the actors are aliens, and his therapist puts him in a secret mental hospital (rehab?) unit.Bobby Bowfinger is left without an actor.So now, the game is on, as Bobby must find a Kit look-a-like. Fortunately for Bobby, he has just found Kit Ramsey's dorky, nerdy twin Jiff: a braces-boasting, gum-chewing, thick-rimmed glasses wearing, loveable freak.But there are more surprises just around the corner for Bobby, as Kit is released from the mental rehab unit and is chased by Bowfinger's actors again, leading to the film's climax. (`Got you, suckas!')Well, now I will evaluate the cast, because the cast of `Bowfinger' is very ensemble.Steve Martin is great in his role as Bowfiner, a hassled director who must resort to an all-time low of filming. But what is great are Martin's dumb-grin expressions throughout the film that make him look like a little child.I have now seen two Eddie Murphy films in two nights: `Bowfinger' and `I Spy,' his performance in both surprising me. In `I Spy' he fit Kelly Robinson like a glove, using his loudmouth antics to full advantage, for once. In `Bowfinger,' Murphy uses his talent to his full advantage as well, convincingly pulling off an egotistical actor and nerdy geek.Heather Graham plays an actress wannabe who sleeps with every man on set of the movie to get her way(s).Robert Downey, Jr. has a small role as a film producer; he is in the film in the very beginning, about five seconds in the middle, and at the very end. I'd estimate his screen presence at about four minutes total.Jamie Kennedy plays Bobby Bowfinger's assistant and friend; he works in a back-lot film studio. To help film the `Chubby Rain' movie, Kennedy's character `borrows' film equipment from the film studio and returns it to them before night. Kennedy was very good in this movie, as he is in his television show `JKX' (The Jamie Kennedy Experiment).Now, on to the interesting aspects of the film:`Bowfinger' has some very interesting and hilarious sequences, including one segment where Bowfinger is having Kit run across a traffic-packed highway during rush hour for the movie he is filming. Hands down the best scene in the film.The movie also has some interesting `con' ideas, which are very provocative and thought provoking. For instance, Bowfinger sets a camera in a large tree-clipper truck, sets Kennedy up there, drives on a highway and films Kit Ramsey in his car, who is being chased by one of Bowfinger's actors. Who would ever think of that? Only Steve Martin, the writer of this film.The thing that makes this movie so funny is the fact that Kit Ramsey has no clue whatsoever about what is going on. One of Bowfinger's actors (the guy who wrote the `Chubby Rain' script) walks up to Kit and, using a special prank, cuts off his own arm (of course it's a fake arm, but Kit thinks it is real and runs away).Unfortunately, believe it or not, I was overall a bit disappointed in the movie. Yes, it is a clever parody of the film industry, and it was not a bad film at all. It was quite funny. But frankly, I was expecting more laughs after reading so many good reviews and finding out Martin wrote the script.
3/5 stars -John Ulmer

A movie about making a movie that Steve Martin's character is the directs a story without the knowledge of Eddie Murphy's character. Such a wonderful silly entertaining experience created by Frank Oz; such a legend! Heather Graham is so beautiful especially when she kisses Bowfinger. I didn't get much sleep last night I'm spaced out but I love Bowfinger, sorry for my clunky review.

After ANALYZE THIS, another comedy highly praised in the States revealed to be flat and not very funny at all.  I've never been a huge fan of either messrs. Martin or Murphy, so I was surprised to find myself at the film at all; but the reviews wree good, and Heather Graham.  The film aims to please on three levels - as comedy; as character study; and as a film about film-making - but fails on all counts.  Actually fail is too strong a word - the film's irritating self-satisfaction never allows for anything as grand as ambition.As a comedy there are simply not enough laughs.  With the possible exception of ROXANNE, I have never gotten the point of Steve Martin, and, as both comedian and scriptwriter, he rarely rises above the obvious here.  The jokes lack teeth - and while the film's lack of the Gothic melodrama which weakens many of the great films about Hollywood (e.g. SUNSET BOULEVARD), by taking it as seriously as it would like - the lack of any real trauma (surely the essence of all great comedy) makes what is essentially a series of loosely cohered sketches rather lame and lifeless.The film severely sags when Eddie Murphy isn't on the screen (I never thought I'd write that), and it's hardly a (double) role that taxes him. His nerd is particularly funny, even if he is the film's pivot into dreaded sentimentality.  The antics of low-budget film crews have been done so much funnier elsewhere (e.g. LIVING IN OBLIVION, a film intimate with nightmare), but Graham shows what a great comedienne she is becoming, and what a knockout she'll be when somebody gives her a character and a decent script.If the film is indifferent as comedy, it is a complete flop as character study.  Martin is a blank - we get no idea as to what drives him to make films.  Like the hero of ED WOOD, his woeful incompetence is compared to the towering, equally struggling, genius of Orson Welles (there is a poster of TOUCH OF EVIL in his house), but whereas Wood's genuine enthusiasm and love poignantly matched the great man's, Bowfinger seems little more that a cynical opportunist.Even this might have been interesting, but Martin doesn't pursue it. Bowfinger's past and private life is equally a void.  He has seemingly been making Z-grade films for a long time, but do people like that exist anymore? Don't they make adult films?  He lives alone with his dog.  He doesn't do the dishes.  He may have had a relationship in the past with the leading lady, it's not clear.  We don't know how he met up with his buddy the car guy.  His supposedly persuasive charm is anything but.The other characters do not rise above caricatures.  Murphy gives more of an impersonation than a performance.  The brother is probably the more believable of the two, but is really only used for cheap laughs.  Kit Ramsey, the action star paranoid at an anti-black conspiracy confiding in a very white Mindhead guru is only amusing as a plot excuse rather than a person.  Martin's misogyny is clearly revealed in Graham's part, which she gives more complexity than it deserves.As a film about filmmaking, BOWFINGER has pretensions to two films - IRMA VEP and the aforementioned ED WOOD, but lacks the former's belief in the transcendent power of cinema, or the melancholy cheerfulness of the latter. It's hard to believe in a film avowing an imdependent spirit that stars Eddie Murphy.  The film is pure Hollywood, the little man who against the odds becomes a (relative)success.  There is never any real danger of this not happening, or if there were we wouldn't care because the characters aren't interesting enough.  The supposed confusions of Bowfinger's kind of guerilla filmmaking are cosily tidied up in slick direction and a pat script.By its very subject matter, the film raises issues such as authenticity, reproduction, authoriality, as well as the integrity of Hollywood (!), or any collaborative product, but doesn't do anything very meaningful with them.  Like VEP, though, I have to admit that there is a certain magic in seeing such a low-budget travesty as the filming of Ramsey in the car lot, transformed into something approaching magic.  But Bowfinger doesn't want to make films anymore than Ramsey does - he wants to make movies, have lunches with powerful producers, attend all-star premieres.  The dash of sentimentality towards the end is so unpalatable because it is so sickly and unearned.  Martin might be a very clever man, but he is not a cinematic thinker like Assayas or Burton - he has no idea why people love movies, and need to make them.  BOWFINGER is quite funny, but do yourself a favour and watch a real, troubled, film like ED WOOD or IRMA VEP instead.

This was one of Martin's lesser films. While Martin invariably invested a lot of himself into this production, as always, I found it less interesting than most of his other endeavors. Co-starring Eddie Murphy, Jamie Kennedy, Heather Graham, and Christine Baranski, I felt most of their wonderful talents went unused, untapped, and uncalled-for. This script simply did nothing to challenge these marvelous actors. And yet, Martin still manages to shine from within the boundaries of this dreary, seemingly low budget production. With a budget of $55 M, direction by Frank Oz, and a screen play by Martin himself, I really expected a lot more from this film.Honestly, they spent $55 M to make a movie about the making of a "B" movie for $2,184.00?! I would have to guess, since IMDb does not show his salary for this film, that at least 10-15 M of the total budget went towards the salary of Mr. Murphy, considering he was paid $20 M for The Klumps 2 PLUS 20% of the movie's gross, according to IMDb. That is sad in itself, but the finished product is so much less than the sum of its parts that it leaves you wondering where IS the movie? While it was fun to watch, this project just did not "work." Good actors, great direction, a good budget, all basically gone up in smoke.While this is still an enjoyable film, I must admit I was far more than a tad disappointed in the finished product. The premise was good, but I honestly believe this movie was such a let down due to the actors' inability to switch out of "B" mode when not in the Chubby Rain phase of this movie. It is like once they got started playing "B" quality characters, they forgot to go back to "A" movie characters when not behind the camera...behind the camera. Confused yet? That is kind of the point. It is so muddled that I believe the actors got confused and Frank Oz forgot to help them keep it together.As a desperate movie producer, Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) must get a movie going, or go under. He takes a really bad script, and attempts to attract talent to the work. When that proves unsuccessful, he dupes his entire staff into believing Kitt Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) has agreed to do the movie, but has a radical "acting style," where he films his scenes on the fly. So Bowfinger begins filming his movie, starring Kitt Ramsey, unbeknownst to Mr. Ramsey. It's a clever and funny idea, but somewhere in the mix, it just gets lost. And yet, I still like and OWN this movie. There is an appeal, but I could not tell you what that appeal is, anymore than I can tell you why it does not work. I have watched this movie again to write this review, and I still have the same mixed feelings about it. See it for yourself, and you be the judge.It rates a 4.2/10 from...the Fiend :.

The remarkable thing about this film is that hardly ever has Steve Martin ever been so genuinely sympathetic without seeming clumsy about it. Believe me, this movie could have been over in the first few minutes if the writing hadn't started out so deliciously cynical. Immediately, I was hooked by the story of this downtrodden dreamer who endeavors to commit his life's savings to a hopeless cause. Forget about the weak (tacked-on) ending and the craziness for comedy's sake. This is a light character study worthy of a filmlover's earnest attention. Kudos to Murphy for the dual role-one a loving tribute to his inner child and the other a biting satire of his public image.

There were many things that were good about this film. To start with the cast. Steve martin and eddie murphy have a good chemistry, despite not meeting eachother, atleast not in the way you think. Heather graham was a nice adiiton along with kristina barisnki and robert downey. There were many side characters that were good aswell and played well. There were good comedy moments in this film to that worked and didnt feel forced. The film itself revolving around a film being made without the main characters in the films knowlarge. It played out all pretty well and really it was a good combination to make a fun and enjoyable film all the way through.

You know a movie is terrible when the best performance is given by the dog. Bravo, pooch.  The rest of you, hang your heads in shame.I've been wondering why I found Eddie Murphy so funny when I was 13.  It's finally hit me--it's BECAUSE I was 13.  Now that the numbers are reversed, his act has gotten tremendously stale.A bad movie about making a bad movie.  The only saving grace is that my roommate paid for the rental.
