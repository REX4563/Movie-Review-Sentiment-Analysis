I'm quite surprised at how many people are slamming this movie for historical inaccuracies, use of English, its similarity to several other films and a happy ending.I had no problem understanding this was not a historical documentary nor did any signs point to this film being the most original sensation of the year. When I went into the film, I expected a fictional Hollywood story with a bit of action and some entertaining special effects. Guess what I got? Yes, I got a fictional Hollywood story with a bit of action and some entertaining special effects. That's all it aspired to be, it works for the film and it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone thinking of sitting through it.On a side note, I hope the same people slamming this film for its historical inaccuracies, use of English and similarity to other works go slam Shakespeare next because these terms describe his most famous plays. As far as I am aware, they weren't speaking Shakespearean English in 13th century Verona, Italy. Anyone hear of, The Tragicall History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke? Published before Shakespeare was even alive, I wonder if he based "Romeo and Juliet" off it?Point is, 10,000 BC should be taken for what it is. It is two hours of Hollywood entertainment. No surprises.

You know how when you go to a cafeteria style restaurant and you see something you usually enjoy like lasagna. You get the lasagna and take a bite with the fond memories of the last time you ate it in a real restaurant. When the first taste hits your tongue and all hopes of future meal enjoyment are flushed down the toilet. 10,000BC is the cafeteria lasagna. It looks goods, has the potential to be great, you have fond memories of other movies in the same genre that were good, and then you watch it. It's edible but just barely. The movie had pretty good special effects and wasn't boring which is why I gave it a five. The dialog and acting were for the most part sub-par. The story didn't even make an attempt to suspend your disbelief. Forget historically inaccurate, it was ridiculous. If I were you I would catch the matin√©e or wait for someone else to pay for the cafeteria lasagna

Some critics have moaned that as film technology grows, the storytelling ability of the movies shrinks. I have never quite agreed with this assessment, as I believe there is a place for spectacle of any variety, even the mindless kind. However, to those who share the view of those critics, 10,000 B.C. will most likely be the most convincing piece of evidence to their argument. Here is a movie that looks like it cost millions to make, but is saddled with a screenplay that looks like it came from the Dollar Store.Director and co-writer, Roland Emmerich is no stranger to brainless spectacles. This is the guy who brought us Independence Day and 1998's Hollywood take on Godzilla, after all. There's a very fine line between brainless and just plain brain dead, unfortunately. 10,000 B.C. is short on spectacle, short on plot, and short on just about anything that people go to the movies for. There are characters and a love story to drive the bare bones plot, but this seems to be added in as an afterthought. I got the impression that Emmerich and fellow screenwriter, Harald Kloser (a film score composer making his first screenplay credit), had the idea for a couple cool scenes, then tried to add a bunch of filler material between them. They threw in some sketchy characters that hardly reach two dimensions to inhabit this filler, and called it a screenplay. In order for spectacle to work, even the cheese-filled variety such as this, there has to be something for the audience to get excited about. This movie is just one big tease.The plot, if it can even be called that, is set in the days of early man. The heroes are an unnamed tribal people who speak perfect English, all have the bodies of supermodels, and hunt mammoths for food. The two characters we're supposed to be focused on are a pair of young lovers named D'Leh (Steven Strait) and Evolet (Camilla Belle). Why they are in love, and why we should care about them, the movie never goes out of its way to explain. The rest of the villagers do not really matter. They exist simply to be captured when a group of foreign invaders come riding into their peaceful tribe, and kidnap most of them to work as slaves back in their own home colony. Evolet is one of the captured, so D'Leh and a small handful of others set out to find where they've been taken to, and to seek the aid of other tribes that have also been invaded by this enemy. There's a mammoth herd here, a saber tooth tiger there, but they have nothing to do with anything. They're just computer generated special effects who are there simply because the filmmakers felt the current scene needed a special effect shot. I'd be more impressed if the effects didn't look so out of place with the actors most of the time.10,000 B.C. probably would have worked better as a silent movie, or a subtitled one, as most of the dialogue that comes out of the mouths of these people are as wooden as the spears they carry. The good tribes are the only people in this movie who have mastered the Queen's English, naturally. The evil invading tribe speak in subtitles, and sometimes have their voices mechanically altered and lowered, so that they sound more threatening and demonic. No one in this movie is allowed to have a personality, or act differently from one another. Everybody in each tribe talks, thinks, and behaves exactly the same, with facial hair and differing body types being the main way to tell them apart. This would make it hard to get involved in the story, but the movie dodges this tricky issue by not even having a story in the first place. Once the film's main tribe is attacked, the movie turns into an endless string of filler material and padding to drag the whole thing out to feature length. Aside from a brief encounter with some bird-like prehistoric creatures, there are no moments of action or danger until D'Leh and his followers reach the land of the invading army. The movie throws a saber tooth tiger encounter to fool us into thinking something's gonna happen, but the tiger winds up being just as boring as the human characters inhabiting the movie, and is just millions in special effects budget wasted on something that didn't need to be there in the first place, other than to move the shaky plot along.There is a key ingredient missing in 10,000 B.C., and that is fun. This movie is not fun to watch at all. I kept on waiting for something, anything, to happen. When something eventually did happen, it was usually underwhelming. I know of people who are interested in seeing this movie, because of the special effects, or because they think it looks enjoyably cheesy. To those people, I say please do not be drawn in by curiosity. This isn't even enjoyable in a bad sense. Your precious time is worth more than what any theater may be charging to see this movie. For anyone wondering, yes, that includes the budget cinema and the price of a rental.

I expected this movie to suck. I thought it would be an adrenaline ride with no plot that you can only fully appreciate if you see it in Imax 3-D - similar to (but worse than) Beowulf. Especially since it had gotten really terrible reviews and everyone who'd seen it told me not to waste the few bucks it would cost to rent it. Well, I finally shelled out the money, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not only as exciting as the trailers promised, it did have a plot and was enjoyable. I will not pretend that it was a brilliant movie, because it just wasn't. It definitely had the premise of what could've been a triumph, but it just couldn't cut it. There was some cheesy dialog, but mostly it was pretty original. The plot was something that could've been ripped off from any ancient folktale, but I think that the scriptwriters and directors did a decent job of making it their own. Seeing as it's supposed to be a legend, and proves itself to be more of a fantasy than historical epic, the historical inaccuracies can be forgiven. All in all, it was a fairly good movie that was both thrilling and enjoyable. I can see why people didn't like it, but, honestly, they're being much too tough on it.

I was hoping to like this movie, to give it a better review than most might give it....but I couldn't. In the end, I had to agree with the reviewers here on IMDb, that this movie stinks. It's true.It's also one of those films that starts off okay, lures you in, and then deteriorates. With 40 minutes to go in the two-hour film, you're ready to walk out but since you've invested 80 minutes you figure, "I might as well see it through the end." The last half hour then becomes like a session at the dentist's office in which you can't wait for the experience to be over.Credibility is probably the worst aspect of this film. Seeing people 10,000 years ago in buildings that look pretty well-made and would do an architect proud today, and hearing people speak with British and other assorted accents - in the same tribe - for the time and place (Mideast or Northern Africa in 10,000 B.C.) almost makes one laugh out loud in spots.....yet this is supposed to be a serious movie. The special-effects were weak, especially with the saber-toothed tiger which not only looks very fake but is proportionally ludicrous. The mammoths didn't look at hokey, but they moved very woodenly, computer-like. This was mainly the reason I watched. I knew it might be stupid but I thought it might at least be fun with eye-popping effects. No, nothing was eye-popping here.It was just dumb....and I didn't even get to the story part, if you want to call it that. Actually, that was the worst part of this film. The screenplay was embarrassingly bad. If you want details on the holes in this story and all the things that were impossible but shown here, check out the other reviews.Folks: you can believe all the negative reviews here on IMDb. They are not lying.

When the child of blue eyes called Evolet is found holding the hands of her dead mother by the tribe of the mammoth hunters Yagahl, their Old Mother (Mona Hammond) tells that the little girl will fulfill an ancient prophecy, marrying the owner of the White Spear and bringing life to their people. Years after, Evolet (Camilla Belle) and the outcast hunter D'Leh (Steven Strait) are in love for each other and D'Leh should dispute the White Spear and Evolet with his rival Ka'Ren (Mo Zainal). However Evolet and many hunters are abducted by the Four-Legged Demons warlords to work as slaves in their distant fields. D'Leh, together with the owner of the White Spear Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis), Ka'Ren and the boy Baku (Nathanael Baring) track the tribe of warriors trying to rescue Evolet and the Yagahl hunters in a dangerous journey through unknown lands. When D'Leh saves a saber-toothed tiger from death, he becomes the leader of oppressed tribes that help him in his quest for freedom, life and love.I was reluctant to see "10,000 BC" because of the low IMDb Rating and many bad reviews. However, as a big fan of Camille Belle, I fortunately decided to see this underrated adventure. The entertaining story is a combination of "Apocalypto", "Quest for Fire" and "Stargate" with a romantic situation, supported by magnificent CGI and action scenes. It is funny to read reviews of people that expect historic accuracy in this type of movie; I recommend that they never watch "A Nightmare on Elm Street", for example, otherwise they may have trouble to sleep¬Ö My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "10.000 A.C." ("10,000 BC")

I am a huge fan of IMDb.com, but I never bothered posting a review. Too much effort, too much fun reading other people's reviews. But tonight... I had to get out of my system how awful this movie is. Tonight... I feel like I was sent on Earth for a purpose. I feel like I understand my role in the great destiny of mankind: to warm people not to watch this piece of garbage.It is true that this movie is somewhat the same than Apocalypto. Without a lot: talent, good actors, suspense, drama. Actually I'm not completely honest. There was a part of the movie when the audience got tense. You could feel a sort of tension in the air. People on the edge of their seats. Something was going to happen on the screen... all of a sudden... the end of the movie, yes. The flow of people rushing out, happy to be delivered, happy to go back to their lives.The highlight of the evening: the previews. It looks like some pretty funny stuff is coming out soon.

I don't understand why people are so negative. I really loved this movie. In fact, I wished it had been a tad bit longer. To me, the movie rushes by. I wanted to know more about all the characters and wished they would haved longer at each place. Most of the criticism comes from the fact that the movie is not based on fact. SO WHAT? It is a fantasy story. I guess these people would criticize THE WIZARD OF OZ because it isn't based on fact.First of all, the film is just beautiful especially the scenes in Egypt. The boat sailing down the nile was wonderful. The special effects were good. The story, although simple, was logical. I liked the Atlantis theme and I would have liked to see more of their backstory. Had a great, if not, predictable ending, but all in all, a great movie!

Well, aside from the historical inaccuracies that everyone has pointed out, this movie had horrid acting, insipid dialog, and a clich√© plot line that any moderately skilled elementary school kid could have written. So what are the redeeming qualities of this movie? The scenery, some of the CGI, and that's about it. On a technical level, I found it hilarious that for all the hype about this movie, it was far worse than I could have imagined. Someone made a comment about the lighting of this movie. There were definitely inconsistencies in the lighting, which added to the list of things wrong with this movie and made it feel like perhaps it was a rushed project.I think if this movie were made without any dialog except for the narrative, it would have been much more enjoyable as a whole.

I enjoyed ID4, Day After Tomorrow. I'll admit it. This 'film' is awful. What a mess. It takes elements from all other fantasy/scifi/epics and is so clich√©'d its an absolute train wreck. Is it an epic? NO. A monster / dinosaur movie? No. Is it a thinly veiled romanctic film akin to Braveheart? NO Is it a gore fest? No. The CGI is NOT that good and rather uninspired. I'd rewatch Jurassic Park and still be in awe compared to this. This movie never made up what it wanted to be. Not that it ever got that far. The climax which is perhaps the only redeeming factor ends so horrifically stupid. It has terrific production values and costume design. Kudos for those...everything else is unremarkable, what a waste.

Coming off some rather poor reviews, I expected failure from this movie, and the first ten minutes delivered all the fail I anticipated. After that, it drastically improved, and while it didn't succeed as an epic, it was very lively and highly imaginative.Starting with the bad, most of the dialogue just plain sucks. It's great that they tried to make the people sound simple, being this is 10,000 BC, but the kids (D'leh and Evolet) had these really painfully Arab-esquire accents and awkward dialogue reminiscent of Attack of the Clones Padme and Anakin. The dumb little kid who follows the hunters also is an embarrassing addition, but thankfully his dialogue is limited.The minor characters, such as the English-speaking African chief, are the only characters who really shine with their simplistic dialogue, and even D'leh sometimes narrowly misses having his lines crumble to sheer stupidity.Also a major detractment is the narrator, who is mostly completely un-needed save to further some events. Other times, we really don't need to hear him, such as the very end when the Old Mother supposedly 'breathes life' into Evolet. The images showed this clearly enough without needless narration.In the beginning, the special effects are rather poor, as you can very clearly see that a character doesn't fit in the background environment, as if they were filmed in front of a green screen, and then attempts at digitally removing the green glare only smeared the picture.Also, it was clearly not necessary to have the ice people of D'leh speak English, as they are the only English-speaking tribe in the movie, and it would have far better served the atmosphere to have them speaking a more primitive language, with more hand and facial gestures than verbosity.The action sequences, costumes, cinematography, and sets were spectacular, and managed to tell the greater story (oppressed tribes banding together to overthrow a tyrant) in a way that far supersedes the main individual story of D'leh trying to save Evolet, though from the prophetic viewpoint, it was interesting how they twisted the two together, having it be that only D'leh's desire to save Evolet could make him lead the tribes to freedom. To sum, the movie succeeds in macro-storytelling, but fails in micro-storytelling.As for the historical accuracy... it's very imaginative. And it requires you to use your imagination to explain certain things.For one, the pyramids in what is clearly Egypt. I thought it was a great explanation to show them using Mammoths to pull their limestone (since even today historians are marveled at how they could have pulled such stones with manpower alone), and though the first pyramids were built some 7,000 years after this movie takes place, the movie makes sure that it is left open to interpretation.What? The pyramids are barely half-way completed in the movie, and the slaves and tribes revolt against their ruler (a tall, godlike figure who must maintain his illusion of divinity to a point of never being seen; his personal slaves are all blind), leaving the pyramids incomplete. You could easily imagine that the pyramids could left incomplete for thousands of years, before a civilization known to us as the Egyptians of hieroglyphs and mummies worked to complete them. Sands could have eroded the pyramids, covering them up completely, or who knows? The movie doesn't definitively say the pyramids were built in 10,000 BC: only that they were begun, and presumably not completed by the original builders.In all, it's a beautifully done movie, which suffers from poor micro-storytelling. If the total story were in the forefront, and the love story reduced to a subplot, I think it would have been a far better movie.

Although well shot in front of gorgeous vistas, on location in New Zealand, Namibia, and South Africa, 10,000 BC is just another loud, dumb, and eminently pointless CGI adventure from the tactless, talentless, hacky direction of Roland Emmerich.There‚Äôs a plot, believe it or not, something about the true love between some tribesman and a hot chick, set in the very distant past, and these rampaging marauders attack their peaceful prehistoric-era tribe and carry off the womenfolk, so our hero spends the next two hours of movie time trying to get her back.But who cares, right? No one in his right mind would watch a Roland Emmerich movie for the plot. The man brought us Godzilla, Independence Day, and The Day after Tomorrow, after all. No, your focus here is supposed to be on the prehistoric-ness of the thing, like the wild, carnivorous birds, or the mastodons, or the sabre-tooth tigers. Oh, and the smoldering hotness of lurve that Our Hero and His Love can barely contain.Your first clue that this won‚Äôt be much more than a silly bore is the simple fact that our noble hunters speak perfect, inflectionless English. No idea why. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of subtitles, granted, but I think here they at least would have made sense. Instead, we have these perfectly coiffed young people with gleaming white teeth - as any prehistoric hunter would have - speaking the Queen‚Äôs English to each other. It‚Äôs bizarre and off-putting. These cool kids look like they fell out of a Gap commercial; they‚Äôd be dead in minutes if they actually had to fend for themselves on a tundra or in the jungle. They‚Äôre as believable as Ed Begley, Jr. at a biker rally. Which is not very believable.And it‚Äôs not as if they get clever, intelligent dialog to mouth. D‚ÄôLeh (heh, sounds like Delay) tells a vicious, trapped sabre-tooth tiger, ‚ÄúDo not eat me when I set you free!‚Äù See, because he doesn‚Äôt want to be eaten, and he figures that reasoning with the beast will do the trick. D‚ÄôLeh, played by newcomer Steven Strait, is sort of a poor man‚Äôs Colin Farrell, complete with otherworldly eyebrows. He wants you to think he‚Äôs earnest and sincere, but instead you think he‚Äôs vapid and vain. Crazy! (‚ÄùDo not eat me when I set you free!‚Äù That‚Äôs hilarious right there. Why, it‚Äôs right up there with ‚ÄúThrow me the whip, and I‚Äôll throw you the idol!‚Äù) Besides, this whole pursuing-the-savages-who-stole-our-people thing was done much better only a few years ago in Mel Gibson‚Äôs Apocalpyto. Now, you might not buy into the notion of using an ancient Mayan dialect in a movie, but at least it made some sense. Using that dialect, with subtitles, there was a real sense of adventure and tragedy; here, the fluid English feels woefully inept and completely anachronistic.Unlike Apocalypto, there‚Äôs scant fighting and mayhem here. The tribe (like that in Apocalypto) is a hunting tribe, so that explains why for much of the movie they run and hide and duck and cover. I will find you! What‚Äôs his name cries. And then he finds her and then loses her again, and he says, I‚Äôll come back! And then he spends the next hour or so trying to find her. His One True Love is like a set of pretty car keys.Back to that tiger, which makes a couple of appearances. Now, I like CGI as much as the next guy. It can very easily enhance a scene, make the unrealistic seem obvious and believable. But this tiger reminded me of the cyclops and other fantastical creatures you‚Äôd see in those old fifties Greek-epic movies, the ones featuring the work of the great Ray Harryhausen - basically, essentially, stop-motion animation. And that looks crappy here in good ol‚Äô 2008.10,000 BC isn‚Äôt meant to be a historical epic - the year 10,000 BC is used here merely to connote a Long Time Ago - which is fine in and of itself, but really isn‚Äôt anything compelling about it other than its setting. It‚Äôs predictable pap without much of a heart, instilling no compassion or feeling from its audience.

I enjoyed this film - I must say I gave it a go despite the slightly below average comments and score. It does take itself a tad too serious - but that element I ignored. May I say, it is a bit corny, a bit silly but nevertheless a worthy effort. No one will ever do a PhD around this but very jolly film. It gave me what I wanted and I'm the better for it.

From the reviews I've read about this movie, it sounded like the worst big budget movie ever made. Now that I've seen it, I can understand why people would say it was so terrible. I will admit 10,000 B.C. is not the best movie ever made for the following reasons: 1. The good guys speak English. I have no problem with that, but when the villains speak another language (which is often made up of grunts and shrieks) to those who speak English, they act like they understand them.2. Many characters have pearly white teeth. I thought dentists weren't around back then? 3. Almost everyone has long dreadlocks. I had the assumption that people long ago could care less about their hairstyle, unless of course they were of royalty.4. The movie does not explain any history to as what tribe the good guys represent and what the bad guys represent. The Babylonians? The Assyrians? Egyptians? No basis of history.5. There are a bunch of prophecies and legends from the tribes that are quickly introduced, into the film, that aren't developed or elaborated. They seem to be thrown in by the screenwriters at the last minute.6. When there comes CGI there is great action sequences. They were very entertaining, but they lacked the suspense that King Kong or even The Lord of the Rings had.7. Omar Sharif is a great actor, but not a great narrator. Rather than speaking distinctively, he mumbles throughout the film.8. With the cast, everyone sounds rehearsed. The actors don't express a whole lot of emotion in the film, making me not care for them. Even the villains are bland.Despite all of those flaws, I actually enjoyed the film. The costume design and set-decoration was wonderfully mastered. I felt like I was seeing a nice Hollywood depiction of what civilization may have looked like thousands of years ago. This movie also has some wonderful CGI. The mammoths look real, so real that I almost would want to reach out and touch their fur. I was also mildly interested in the typical "saving the damsel in distress and freeing the people part" of the little solid story it had.To sum this film up, it is a big budget film that probably most people will forget over the next month like many people did with Alexander. 5/10

The story deals about a a young hunter named D'Leh (Steven Strait) happily living in his prehistoric tribe which dedicates the mammoth hunt. When a group of horse-riding warriors (Ben Badra) attack his tribe and abduct his love interest named Evolet (Camilla Belle), he sets out in pursuit accompanied by Tic Tic(Cliff Curtis). They must confront several dangers and risks, such as a Sabretooth, giant bird (Roc), savage mammoth and many others. They travel through uncharted landscapes towards an unknown territory .This exciting picture is full of action, emotion, feats, thrills, a love story and is pretty amusing . Steven Strait as young and valiant warrior is nice, he's driven by love and destiny to impressive adventures . Camilla Belle in one of his first roles as adult girl is very good, shining her playing as gorgeous Evolet. Excellent secondary role for Cliff Curtis as tough and self-sacrificing warrior , furthermore Omar Shariff as narrator in off . Stirring and evocative musical score by Harald Kloser(also producer and writer) . Colorful cinematography reflecting splendidly the breathtaking outdoors by Ueli Steiger (Godzilla, Day after tomorrow) , Emmerich's usual. The picture is lavishly produced by Emmerich, Harald Kloser and Mark Gordon. Overwhelming special effects and creature designs by Tatopoulus Studios. The flick is professionally directed by Roland Emmerich. He's a good director, writer and producer who founded along with Dean Devlin the company Centropolis Entertainment. Emmerich is an expert on making movies for the masses and specialist on large-scale disaster movies (Day after tomorrow,Independence day ) and spectacular stories (Stagate,The patriot, Universal soldier), recently and in production he's shooting an epic adventure about global cataclysm that brings an end to the world , titled '2012'.

Went to a preview screening last night. Thankfully I did not have to pay for this one, but had to endure it. Yup, the negative reviews are right on the money. This movie is plagued by weak dialogue ("we are tired, we sleep here?") weaker characters (laughable old mother, Diva Plavalaguna ripoff...aww c'mon get real), and the weakest most predictable story (recycled from vastly superior Apocalypto, Mel should get a cut or an apology).The SP effects were inconsistent, needed more sabertooth (or even more "cowbell" for that matter...see how crazy this movie has made me) and what was with those laughable attack chickens (again another apology owed this time to Ice Age).Heck, even when D'Leh makes his big Leader speech to the tribes before the final battle, didn't we already see this scene in 1996 with President Whitmore declaring our Independence Day? Want more ripoffs...how about King Leonidas spear throw on Xeres? Seen it, seen it, seen it!!!Maybe Roland was paying tribute to the genre, but I seriously doubt it. Makes us miss Astronaut Taylor & Nova, heck even Beastmaster Dar & Kiri all did it so much better.Anyway the 1 star is for Evolet for teasing us throughout.After 2 hours the audience was groaning having endured 10000 clich√©s.And if you're thinking about waiting for the DVD, save your hard earned money because nothing can save this Mammoth Razzie!

OK, after hearing many horrible reviews for 10,000 BC, I have to say that I was really put off, this I was assuming was supposed to be the big kick off to the huge block busters. But I got to see it for free, and I always think that sometimes people just misjudge a film, even though my co-worker warned me, I still went for it and saw it. Thank God the movie ended when it did, I had the neuce around my neck by the end of this film. I mean, seriously, did the "writer" do any history homework?! First off, let's talk about appearances, the "cave men" have perfect teeth, have evolved well for what's supposed to be over 10,000 years ago, and remove the dirt, they're skin belongs in a Neutragina ad. Script? Was there one? I have no idea, the story made absolutely no sense and the ending was horrible. I don't want to give away what happens, but trust me, I think you'll be as confused as I was.I'm going to try my best to explain the plot to you, it's high school drama with cave men, so bare with me. De'Leh is a cave man with his tribe and has earned the title of "best warrior", he is allowed to have any woman, so he picks his childhood sweet heart, Evolet, but he later feels as if he didn't earn that right, so he "gives her up". She is kidnapped by another gang, oh, no! Whatever will he do? He gave her up, but he still digs her and never even got a kiss! So he goes after her with a few of his friends and find themselves fighting saber-tooth's, monstrous snow storms, a snake river, and even a god who got a bad nail job. Oh, let's hope he can save his girlfriend in time and all will be well.That's the Cliff's Notes version I can come up with. May I just say that I absolutely loved how the cave men spoke perfect English, seriously, I didn't realize that it was possible for them to speak that well in American English. This script was written for 12 year old's, seriously. Then they put in these awkward jokes, strange characters that are more laughable than serious, and a love story that would seriously be so non-existent if this was an accurate portrayal of history. I don't mind when they "bend" the truth for dramatic purposes, but this was the friggin' Seasamse Street version of cave men history. Stay away from this trash, it's just a waste of time, sadly, how many good movies could have been made with the budget they probably put onto this film? I'm seeing at least 7 already.1/10

Normally I'm not a fan of Roland Emmerich's movies plainly because they're lacking (1998's Godzilla, Independence Day, The day after tomorrow) but this once is above average and many will find it quite watchable. The story takes place 10,000 years ago in prehistoric Africa where a mammoth hunter D'leh (pronounced delyay) chases after a more advanced civilization who has captured his lover evolet and many other members of his tribe. Though there are quite a number of historical inaccuracies, it makes up for it in CGI, great acting. I must say it was really put together nicely. PROS Amazing CGI Acting Great pacing Action packedCONS A little boring at some parts (Near the end) InaccuraciesOverall rating: 6 out of 10this movie is a decent rent in my book. Check it out.

I'm quite surprised at how many people are slamming this movie for historical inaccuracies, use of English, its similarity to several other films and a happy ending.I had no problem understanding this was not a historical documentary nor did any signs point to this film being the most original sensation of the year. When I went into the film, I expected a fictional Hollywood story with a bit of action and some entertaining special effects. Guess what I got? Yes, I got a fictional Hollywood story with a bit of action and some entertaining special effects. That's all it aspired to be, it works for the film and it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone thinking of sitting through it.On a side note, I hope the same people slamming this film for its historical inaccuracies, use of English and similarity to other works go slam Shakespeare next because these terms describe his most famous plays. As far as I am aware, they weren't speaking Shakespearean English in 13th century Verona, Italy. Anyone hear of, The Tragicall History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke? Published before Shakespeare was even alive, I wonder if he based "Romeo and Juliet" off it?Point is, 10,000 BC should be taken for what it is. It is two hours of Hollywood entertainment. No surprises.

You know how when you go to a cafeteria style restaurant and you see something you usually enjoy like lasagna. You get the lasagna and take a bite with the fond memories of the last time you ate it in a real restaurant. When the first taste hits your tongue and all hopes of future meal enjoyment are flushed down the toilet. 10,000BC is the cafeteria lasagna. It looks goods, has the potential to be great, you have fond memories of other movies in the same genre that were good, and then you watch it. It's edible but just barely. The movie had pretty good special effects and wasn't boring which is why I gave it a five. The dialog and acting were for the most part sub-par. The story didn't even make an attempt to suspend your disbelief. Forget historically inaccurate, it was ridiculous. If I were you I would catch the matin√©e or wait for someone else to pay for the cafeteria lasagna

To anyone who has ever yearned to see woolly mammoths in full stampede across the Alps, 10,000 BC can be heartily recommended. There's also a flock of "terror birds"--lethal ostriches on steroids--in a steaming jungle only a splice away from the heroes' snow-dusted alpine habitat. And lo, somewhere in the vastness of the North African desert lies a city whose slave inhabitants alternately teem like the crowds in Quo Vadis during the burning of Rome and trudge in hieratic ally menacing formations like the workers in Metropolis. That's pretty much it for the cool stuff. Setting movies in prehistoric times is dicey. Apart from the "Dawn of Man" sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey, only Quest for Fire makes the grade, and its creators had the good sense to limit the duologue to grunts and moans. 10,000 BC boasts a quasi-biblical narrator (Omar Sharif) and characters who speak in formed, albeit uninteresting, sentences--including a New Age¬ñy "I understand your pain." But let no one say the storytelling isn't primitive. The narrator speaks of "the legend of the child with the blue eyes" and bingo, here's the kid now. When, grown up to be Camilla Belle, she's carried off by "four-legged demons"--guys on horseback to you--the neighbor boy (Steven Strait) who hankers to make myth with her leads a rescue mission into the great unknown world beyond their mountaintop. His name is D'Leh, which is Held, the German for "knight," spelled backward. So yes, there is some hidden meaning after all. 10,000 BC is the latest triumph of the ersatz from writer-director Roland Emmerich. Like Stargate (1994), Independence Day (1996), and The Day After Tomorrow (2004) before it, it's shamelessly cobbled together out of every movie Emmerich can remember to pilfer from (though to be fair, the section in per-ancient Egypt harks back to his own Stargate). Emmerich's saving grace is that his films' cheesiness is so flagrant, his narratives so geared for instant gratification, he can seem like a kid simultaneously improvising and acting out a story in his backyard: "P'tend there's this alien ... p'tend maybe he came from Atlantis or something...." Just don't p'tend it has anything to do with real movie-making.Starring: Steven Strait, Camilla Belle, Cliff Cirtus, Joel Virgel. Director: Roland Emmerich.

The film starts by introducing us to a Multi-culti tribe in Switzerland (?) led by a shaman eskimo woman. They seemed to have forgotten that prehistoric hunter gatherers generally wandered around and fill instead their days by waiting all year in their village for mammoths to meander by and kill one for food which luckily lasts all year. Their 'noble' existence is shattered by some Arab horsemen looking for slaves. They leave the Alps into the jungles (!) of Italy(?) where they are attacked by birds which once lived in South America. The scenery changes to Utah as they track the slavers into Africa. They meet some Zulu tribes who happened to have bumped into the Swiss hunter's father and who somehow managed to teach the Zulu tribe the one language that seems to exist in Europe. The Arab desert slavers have attacked the zulus too so the Swiss and the zulus combine forces to attack the slavers. Rather than follow the river (the Nile?) to the slave town, they decide to cross the Sahara (after all there's no food or water by a river so this would seem a sensible option!).After wandering around for weeks they look to the stars and decide to follow the North Star (the slave city, in common with Santa's hideaway is under it apparently). Hey ho, after a few days they find slave city and it turns out to be a pyramid construction site led by an alien. Luckily, the crafty alien god has lots of slaves and a ready source of desert living woolly mammoths to help build his pyramid. Swiss hunter cries 'operation desert freedom' and the slaves rebel. The alien god's Indian eunuchs (fresh out of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom)and some albino africans flee to a giant ship stored in a pyramid but the rebelling slaves catch them up and kill the giant alien who turns out to be 'Lurch' from the Adams family. Eskimo woman then dies back in the Alps to bring Swiss hunters girlfriend back to life in the Sahara (she's prophetic as shes got blue eyes - apparently rare we're led to believe in Switzerland). The film ends with the desert dwelling Zulus giving the Swiss crops which somehow grew in the Sahara. The Swiss then set off home surely cursing that they set Lurch's giant boat alight as it surely would have speeded up their journey across the Mediterranean. They have a group hug back in the Alps when their desert crops begin to grow at the foot of a glacier...Needless to say I won't be buying the DVD

While I was certainly not going to watch 10,000 B. C. expecting a masterpiece, I got much more than I bargained for as well. While the film is not excellent, it entertained me thoroughly and I was interested throughout the entire watch and surprised after it was over. It is pelted with comments and reviews about how it is poorly written, edited and played out, though I am here to counter those three accusations, because I, like a few numbers of people, thought it was enjoyable.The movie could upset many scientists or people who love and or respect history. Having mammoths in what looks like the Ice Age, large Velociraptor-like birds in an immense jungle and Egyptians all in the same time era, it seems like the movie just threw a whole bunch of material together. However, I am always willing to accept that even with information and proof on past time eras, we can never be 100% certain on anything, and I judged this film not on it's historical accuracy, but it's entertainment and enjoyment levels. The characters, while a lot are a bit unbelievable or one-dimensional, all pass the time effectively and fill in for what is needed in the story. The storyline itself is probably my favorite aspect, having some wonderful material to work with and really nice effects and performances from the lead man and Camilla Belle, who is regarded as a horrid actress, but I very well liked in this and her other work.It is nicely done, in the sense that I am interested and entertained with how everything moves along, and even though it seems like it is unsure on which direction it should go at some points, it never jumps subject, even if it does jump scenes. I do not understand Roland Emmerich, though. It seems at times that he just did not want to concentrate on or deal with this film, having some very poorly played out scenes. Even if I liked the way it moved along, he was not as dedicated as he could have been on this movie like he was Godzilla and even The Day After Tomorrow. The movie also has some poor dialogue and some material just does not make sense, but I still however stand by my approval of it. It is not as bad as many claim, even if it is not amazing. It is worth the watch if you want to watch it.A+ for replay value
A+ for sheer no-brain entertainment
A+ costumes and makeup
A+ for special effectsThumbs up.

Some critics have moaned that as film technology grows, the storytelling ability of the movies shrinks. I have never quite agreed with this assessment, as I believe there is a place for spectacle of any variety, even the mindless kind. However, to those who share the view of those critics, 10,000 B.C. will most likely be the most convincing piece of evidence to their argument. Here is a movie that looks like it cost millions to make, but is saddled with a screenplay that looks like it came from the Dollar Store.Director and co-writer, Roland Emmerich is no stranger to brainless spectacles. This is the guy who brought us Independence Day and 1998's Hollywood take on Godzilla, after all. There's a very fine line between brainless and just plain brain dead, unfortunately. 10,000 B.C. is short on spectacle, short on plot, and short on just about anything that people go to the movies for. There are characters and a love story to drive the bare bones plot, but this seems to be added in as an afterthought. I got the impression that Emmerich and fellow screenwriter, Harald Kloser (a film score composer making his first screenplay credit), had the idea for a couple cool scenes, then tried to add a bunch of filler material between them. They threw in some sketchy characters that hardly reach two dimensions to inhabit this filler, and called it a screenplay. In order for spectacle to work, even the cheese-filled variety such as this, there has to be something for the audience to get excited about. This movie is just one big tease.The plot, if it can even be called that, is set in the days of early man. The heroes are an unnamed tribal people who speak perfect English, all have the bodies of supermodels, and hunt mammoths for food. The two characters we're supposed to be focused on are a pair of young lovers named D'Leh (Steven Strait) and Evolet (Camilla Belle). Why they are in love, and why we should care about them, the movie never goes out of its way to explain. The rest of the villagers do not really matter. They exist simply to be captured when a group of foreign invaders come riding into their peaceful tribe, and kidnap most of them to work as slaves back in their own home colony. Evolet is one of the captured, so D'Leh and a small handful of others set out to find where they've been taken to, and to seek the aid of other tribes that have also been invaded by this enemy. There's a mammoth herd here, a saber tooth tiger there, but they have nothing to do with anything. They're just computer generated special effects who are there simply because the filmmakers felt the current scene needed a special effect shot. I'd be more impressed if the effects didn't look so out of place with the actors most of the time.10,000 B.C. probably would have worked better as a silent movie, or a subtitled one, as most of the dialogue that comes out of the mouths of these people are as wooden as the spears they carry. The good tribes are the only people in this movie who have mastered the Queen's English, naturally. The evil invading tribe speak in subtitles, and sometimes have their voices mechanically altered and lowered, so that they sound more threatening and demonic. No one in this movie is allowed to have a personality, or act differently from one another. Everybody in each tribe talks, thinks, and behaves exactly the same, with facial hair and differing body types being the main way to tell them apart. This would make it hard to get involved in the story, but the movie dodges this tricky issue by not even having a story in the first place. Once the film's main tribe is attacked, the movie turns into an endless string of filler material and padding to drag the whole thing out to feature length. Aside from a brief encounter with some bird-like prehistoric creatures, there are no moments of action or danger until D'Leh and his followers reach the land of the invading army. The movie throws a saber tooth tiger encounter to fool us into thinking something's gonna happen, but the tiger winds up being just as boring as the human characters inhabiting the movie, and is just millions in special effects budget wasted on something that didn't need to be there in the first place, other than to move the shaky plot along.There is a key ingredient missing in 10,000 B.C., and that is fun. This movie is not fun to watch at all. I kept on waiting for something, anything, to happen. When something eventually did happen, it was usually underwhelming. I know of people who are interested in seeing this movie, because of the special effects, or because they think it looks enjoyably cheesy. To those people, I say please do not be drawn in by curiosity. This isn't even enjoyable in a bad sense. Your precious time is worth more than what any theater may be charging to see this movie. For anyone wondering, yes, that includes the budget cinema and the price of a rental.

I expected this movie to suck. I thought it would be an adrenaline ride with no plot that you can only fully appreciate if you see it in Imax 3-D - similar to (but worse than) Beowulf. Especially since it had gotten really terrible reviews and everyone who'd seen it told me not to waste the few bucks it would cost to rent it. Well, I finally shelled out the money, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not only as exciting as the trailers promised, it did have a plot and was enjoyable. I will not pretend that it was a brilliant movie, because it just wasn't. It definitely had the premise of what could've been a triumph, but it just couldn't cut it. There was some cheesy dialog, but mostly it was pretty original. The plot was something that could've been ripped off from any ancient folktale, but I think that the scriptwriters and directors did a decent job of making it their own. Seeing as it's supposed to be a legend, and proves itself to be more of a fantasy than historical epic, the historical inaccuracies can be forgiven. All in all, it was a fairly good movie that was both thrilling and enjoyable. I can see why people didn't like it, but, honestly, they're being much too tough on it.

I was hoping to like this movie, to give it a better review than most might give it....but I couldn't. In the end, I had to agree with the reviewers here on IMDb, that this movie stinks. It's true.It's also one of those films that starts off okay, lures you in, and then deteriorates. With 40 minutes to go in the two-hour film, you're ready to walk out but since you've invested 80 minutes you figure, "I might as well see it through the end." The last half hour then becomes like a session at the dentist's office in which you can't wait for the experience to be over.Credibility is probably the worst aspect of this film. Seeing people 10,000 years ago in buildings that look pretty well-made and would do an architect proud today, and hearing people speak with British and other assorted accents - in the same tribe - for the time and place (Mideast or Northern Africa in 10,000 B.C.) almost makes one laugh out loud in spots.....yet this is supposed to be a serious movie. The special-effects were weak, especially with the saber-toothed tiger which not only looks very fake but is proportionally ludicrous. The mammoths didn't look at hokey, but they moved very woodenly, computer-like. This was mainly the reason I watched. I knew it might be stupid but I thought it might at least be fun with eye-popping effects. No, nothing was eye-popping here.It was just dumb....and I didn't even get to the story part, if you want to call it that. Actually, that was the worst part of this film. The screenplay was embarrassingly bad. If you want details on the holes in this story and all the things that were impossible but shown here, check out the other reviews.Folks: you can believe all the negative reviews here on IMDb. They are not lying.

When the child of blue eyes called Evolet is found holding the hands of her dead mother by the tribe of the mammoth hunters Yagahl, their Old Mother (Mona Hammond) tells that the little girl will fulfill an ancient prophecy, marrying the owner of the White Spear and bringing life to their people. Years after, Evolet (Camilla Belle) and the outcast hunter D'Leh (Steven Strait) are in love for each other and D'Leh should dispute the White Spear and Evolet with his rival Ka'Ren (Mo Zainal). However Evolet and many hunters are abducted by the Four-Legged Demons warlords to work as slaves in their distant fields. D'Leh, together with the owner of the White Spear Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis), Ka'Ren and the boy Baku (Nathanael Baring) track the tribe of warriors trying to rescue Evolet and the Yagahl hunters in a dangerous journey through unknown lands. When D'Leh saves a saber-toothed tiger from death, he becomes the leader of oppressed tribes that help him in his quest for freedom, life and love.I was reluctant to see "10,000 BC" because of the low IMDb Rating and many bad reviews. However, as a big fan of Camille Belle, I fortunately decided to see this underrated adventure. The entertaining story is a combination of "Apocalypto", "Quest for Fire" and "Stargate" with a romantic situation, supported by magnificent CGI and action scenes. It is funny to read reviews of people that expect historic accuracy in this type of movie; I recommend that they never watch "A Nightmare on Elm Street", for example, otherwise they may have trouble to sleep¬Ö My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "10.000 A.C." ("10,000 BC")

I am a huge fan of IMDb.com, but I never bothered posting a review. Too much effort, too much fun reading other people's reviews. But tonight... I had to get out of my system how awful this movie is. Tonight... I feel like I was sent on Earth for a purpose. I feel like I understand my role in the great destiny of mankind: to warm people not to watch this piece of garbage.It is true that this movie is somewhat the same than Apocalypto. Without a lot: talent, good actors, suspense, drama. Actually I'm not completely honest. There was a part of the movie when the audience got tense. You could feel a sort of tension in the air. People on the edge of their seats. Something was going to happen on the screen... all of a sudden... the end of the movie, yes. The flow of people rushing out, happy to be delivered, happy to go back to their lives.The highlight of the evening: the previews. It looks like some pretty funny stuff is coming out soon.

I don't understand why people are so negative. I really loved this movie. In fact, I wished it had been a tad bit longer. To me, the movie rushes by. I wanted to know more about all the characters and wished they would haved longer at each place. Most of the criticism comes from the fact that the movie is not based on fact. SO WHAT? It is a fantasy story. I guess these people would criticize THE WIZARD OF OZ because it isn't based on fact.First of all, the film is just beautiful especially the scenes in Egypt. The boat sailing down the nile was wonderful. The special effects were good. The story, although simple, was logical. I liked the Atlantis theme and I would have liked to see more of their backstory. Had a great, if not, predictable ending, but all in all, a great movie!

It's best to view this movie with the proper expectations. It certainly wasn't designed to be a realistic or historically accurate portrayal of the times, but better serves as a mythological tale of human struggle as experienced by a fictional tribe somewhere North of the Himalayan mountains, and what they were able to learn from the interaction of their leader D'hel while on his journey with other tribes to recapture their people who were taken as slaves by a more advanced civilization.Yes there are many inconsistencies with this film as it relates to time, place, and languages spoken. Even more amusing is the existence of jungle roaming, carnivorous ostriches (which never existed), along with sabre tooth tigers and wooly mammoths that had long been extinct. What is to be appreciated from this movie is the struggle of mankind against each other, including personal insecurities, overcome by co-operation of those who developed a vested interest to unite and vanquish a common enemy. In this respect, the movie should be compared with those challenges faced throughout history which continue to this day.Some other embellishments include the protagonist and his modest crew crossing the Himalayas while keeping pace with "the demons with four legs" (Egyptians on horseback) who captured their villagers, including the cherished Evolet. The extreme distance of their journey by far exceeds the possible range covered these peoples, who though nomadic, usually never wandered more than a few hundred square miles from their origins. Despite harsh realities, we witness their grim meanderings across the Himalayas, through Indian jungles, across the Middle East, and lastly as they join forces with African tribes along the Nile, even while dragging their injured. A journey of this magnitude would not have been possible for another 5,000 years until Mesopotamians had domesticated horses in the first place.However, considering the movie for its context rather than its content, 10,000 B.C. becomes an intriguing diversion, and a more realistic entertainment alternative than reality television.

Well, aside from the historical inaccuracies that everyone has pointed out, this movie had horrid acting, insipid dialog, and a clich√© plot line that any moderately skilled elementary school kid could have written. So what are the redeeming qualities of this movie? The scenery, some of the CGI, and that's about it. On a technical level, I found it hilarious that for all the hype about this movie, it was far worse than I could have imagined. Someone made a comment about the lighting of this movie. There were definitely inconsistencies in the lighting, which added to the list of things wrong with this movie and made it feel like perhaps it was a rushed project.I think if this movie were made without any dialog except for the narrative, it would have been much more enjoyable as a whole.

I enjoyed ID4, Day After Tomorrow. I'll admit it. This 'film' is awful. What a mess. It takes elements from all other fantasy/scifi/epics and is so clich√©'d its an absolute train wreck. Is it an epic? NO. A monster / dinosaur movie? No. Is it a thinly veiled romanctic film akin to Braveheart? NO Is it a gore fest? No. The CGI is NOT that good and rather uninspired. I'd rewatch Jurassic Park and still be in awe compared to this. This movie never made up what it wanted to be. Not that it ever got that far. The climax which is perhaps the only redeeming factor ends so horrifically stupid. It has terrific production values and costume design. Kudos for those...everything else is unremarkable, what a waste.

Coming off some rather poor reviews, I expected failure from this movie, and the first ten minutes delivered all the fail I anticipated. After that, it drastically improved, and while it didn't succeed as an epic, it was very lively and highly imaginative.Starting with the bad, most of the dialogue just plain sucks. It's great that they tried to make the people sound simple, being this is 10,000 BC, but the kids (D'leh and Evolet) had these really painfully Arab-esquire accents and awkward dialogue reminiscent of Attack of the Clones Padme and Anakin. The dumb little kid who follows the hunters also is an embarrassing addition, but thankfully his dialogue is limited.The minor characters, such as the English-speaking African chief, are the only characters who really shine with their simplistic dialogue, and even D'leh sometimes narrowly misses having his lines crumble to sheer stupidity.Also a major detractment is the narrator, who is mostly completely un-needed save to further some events. Other times, we really don't need to hear him, such as the very end when the Old Mother supposedly 'breathes life' into Evolet. The images showed this clearly enough without needless narration.In the beginning, the special effects are rather poor, as you can very clearly see that a character doesn't fit in the background environment, as if they were filmed in front of a green screen, and then attempts at digitally removing the green glare only smeared the picture.Also, it was clearly not necessary to have the ice people of D'leh speak English, as they are the only English-speaking tribe in the movie, and it would have far better served the atmosphere to have them speaking a more primitive language, with more hand and facial gestures than verbosity.The action sequences, costumes, cinematography, and sets were spectacular, and managed to tell the greater story (oppressed tribes banding together to overthrow a tyrant) in a way that far supersedes the main individual story of D'leh trying to save Evolet, though from the prophetic viewpoint, it was interesting how they twisted the two together, having it be that only D'leh's desire to save Evolet could make him lead the tribes to freedom. To sum, the movie succeeds in macro-storytelling, but fails in micro-storytelling.As for the historical accuracy... it's very imaginative. And it requires you to use your imagination to explain certain things.For one, the pyramids in what is clearly Egypt. I thought it was a great explanation to show them using Mammoths to pull their limestone (since even today historians are marveled at how they could have pulled such stones with manpower alone), and though the first pyramids were built some 7,000 years after this movie takes place, the movie makes sure that it is left open to interpretation.What? The pyramids are barely half-way completed in the movie, and the slaves and tribes revolt against their ruler (a tall, godlike figure who must maintain his illusion of divinity to a point of never being seen; his personal slaves are all blind), leaving the pyramids incomplete. You could easily imagine that the pyramids could left incomplete for thousands of years, before a civilization known to us as the Egyptians of hieroglyphs and mummies worked to complete them. Sands could have eroded the pyramids, covering them up completely, or who knows? The movie doesn't definitively say the pyramids were built in 10,000 BC: only that they were begun, and presumably not completed by the original builders.In all, it's a beautifully done movie, which suffers from poor micro-storytelling. If the total story were in the forefront, and the love story reduced to a subplot, I think it would have been a far better movie.

Although well shot in front of gorgeous vistas, on location in New Zealand, Namibia, and South Africa, 10,000 BC is just another loud, dumb, and eminently pointless CGI adventure from the tactless, talentless, hacky direction of Roland Emmerich.There‚Äôs a plot, believe it or not, something about the true love between some tribesman and a hot chick, set in the very distant past, and these rampaging marauders attack their peaceful prehistoric-era tribe and carry off the womenfolk, so our hero spends the next two hours of movie time trying to get her back.But who cares, right? No one in his right mind would watch a Roland Emmerich movie for the plot. The man brought us Godzilla, Independence Day, and The Day after Tomorrow, after all. No, your focus here is supposed to be on the prehistoric-ness of the thing, like the wild, carnivorous birds, or the mastodons, or the sabre-tooth tigers. Oh, and the smoldering hotness of lurve that Our Hero and His Love can barely contain.Your first clue that this won‚Äôt be much more than a silly bore is the simple fact that our noble hunters speak perfect, inflectionless English. No idea why. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of subtitles, granted, but I think here they at least would have made sense. Instead, we have these perfectly coiffed young people with gleaming white teeth - as any prehistoric hunter would have - speaking the Queen‚Äôs English to each other. It‚Äôs bizarre and off-putting. These cool kids look like they fell out of a Gap commercial; they‚Äôd be dead in minutes if they actually had to fend for themselves on a tundra or in the jungle. They‚Äôre as believable as Ed Begley, Jr. at a biker rally. Which is not very believable.And it‚Äôs not as if they get clever, intelligent dialog to mouth. D‚ÄôLeh (heh, sounds like Delay) tells a vicious, trapped sabre-tooth tiger, ‚ÄúDo not eat me when I set you free!‚Äù See, because he doesn‚Äôt want to be eaten, and he figures that reasoning with the beast will do the trick. D‚ÄôLeh, played by newcomer Steven Strait, is sort of a poor man‚Äôs Colin Farrell, complete with otherworldly eyebrows. He wants you to think he‚Äôs earnest and sincere, but instead you think he‚Äôs vapid and vain. Crazy! (‚ÄùDo not eat me when I set you free!‚Äù That‚Äôs hilarious right there. Why, it‚Äôs right up there with ‚ÄúThrow me the whip, and I‚Äôll throw you the idol!‚Äù) Besides, this whole pursuing-the-savages-who-stole-our-people thing was done much better only a few years ago in Mel Gibson‚Äôs Apocalpyto. Now, you might not buy into the notion of using an ancient Mayan dialect in a movie, but at least it made some sense. Using that dialect, with subtitles, there was a real sense of adventure and tragedy; here, the fluid English feels woefully inept and completely anachronistic.Unlike Apocalypto, there‚Äôs scant fighting and mayhem here. The tribe (like that in Apocalypto) is a hunting tribe, so that explains why for much of the movie they run and hide and duck and cover. I will find you! What‚Äôs his name cries. And then he finds her and then loses her again, and he says, I‚Äôll come back! And then he spends the next hour or so trying to find her. His One True Love is like a set of pretty car keys.Back to that tiger, which makes a couple of appearances. Now, I like CGI as much as the next guy. It can very easily enhance a scene, make the unrealistic seem obvious and believable. But this tiger reminded me of the cyclops and other fantastical creatures you‚Äôd see in those old fifties Greek-epic movies, the ones featuring the work of the great Ray Harryhausen - basically, essentially, stop-motion animation. And that looks crappy here in good ol‚Äô 2008.10,000 BC isn‚Äôt meant to be a historical epic - the year 10,000 BC is used here merely to connote a Long Time Ago - which is fine in and of itself, but really isn‚Äôt anything compelling about it other than its setting. It‚Äôs predictable pap without much of a heart, instilling no compassion or feeling from its audience.

I enjoyed this film - I must say I gave it a go despite the slightly below average comments and score. It does take itself a tad too serious - but that element I ignored. May I say, it is a bit corny, a bit silly but nevertheless a worthy effort. No one will ever do a PhD around this but very jolly film. It gave me what I wanted and I'm the better for it.

From the reviews I've read about this movie, it sounded like the worst big budget movie ever made. Now that I've seen it, I can understand why people would say it was so terrible. I will admit 10,000 B.C. is not the best movie ever made for the following reasons: 1. The good guys speak English. I have no problem with that, but when the villains speak another language (which is often made up of grunts and shrieks) to those who speak English, they act like they understand them.2. Many characters have pearly white teeth. I thought dentists weren't around back then? 3. Almost everyone has long dreadlocks. I had the assumption that people long ago could care less about their hairstyle, unless of course they were of royalty.4. The movie does not explain any history to as what tribe the good guys represent and what the bad guys represent. The Babylonians? The Assyrians? Egyptians? No basis of history.5. There are a bunch of prophecies and legends from the tribes that are quickly introduced, into the film, that aren't developed or elaborated. They seem to be thrown in by the screenwriters at the last minute.6. When there comes CGI there is great action sequences. They were very entertaining, but they lacked the suspense that King Kong or even The Lord of the Rings had.7. Omar Sharif is a great actor, but not a great narrator. Rather than speaking distinctively, he mumbles throughout the film.8. With the cast, everyone sounds rehearsed. The actors don't express a whole lot of emotion in the film, making me not care for them. Even the villains are bland.Despite all of those flaws, I actually enjoyed the film. The costume design and set-decoration was wonderfully mastered. I felt like I was seeing a nice Hollywood depiction of what civilization may have looked like thousands of years ago. This movie also has some wonderful CGI. The mammoths look real, so real that I almost would want to reach out and touch their fur. I was also mildly interested in the typical "saving the damsel in distress and freeing the people part" of the little solid story it had.To sum this film up, it is a big budget film that probably most people will forget over the next month like many people did with Alexander. 5/10

The story deals about a a young hunter named D'Leh (Steven Strait) happily living in his prehistoric tribe which dedicates the mammoth hunt. When a group of horse-riding warriors (Ben Badra) attack his tribe and abduct his love interest named Evolet (Camilla Belle), he sets out in pursuit accompanied by Tic Tic(Cliff Curtis). They must confront several dangers and risks, such as a Sabretooth, giant bird (Roc), savage mammoth and many others. They travel through uncharted landscapes towards an unknown territory .This exciting picture is full of action, emotion, feats, thrills, a love story and is pretty amusing . Steven Strait as young and valiant warrior is nice, he's driven by love and destiny to impressive adventures . Camilla Belle in one of his first roles as adult girl is very good, shining her playing as gorgeous Evolet. Excellent secondary role for Cliff Curtis as tough and self-sacrificing warrior , furthermore Omar Shariff as narrator in off . Stirring and evocative musical score by Harald Kloser(also producer and writer) . Colorful cinematography reflecting splendidly the breathtaking outdoors by Ueli Steiger (Godzilla, Day after tomorrow) , Emmerich's usual. The picture is lavishly produced by Emmerich, Harald Kloser and Mark Gordon. Overwhelming special effects and creature designs by Tatopoulus Studios. The flick is professionally directed by Roland Emmerich. He's a good director, writer and producer who founded along with Dean Devlin the company Centropolis Entertainment. Emmerich is an expert on making movies for the masses and specialist on large-scale disaster movies (Day after tomorrow,Independence day ) and spectacular stories (Stagate,The patriot, Universal soldier), recently and in production he's shooting an epic adventure about global cataclysm that brings an end to the world , titled '2012'.

Went to a preview screening last night. Thankfully I did not have to pay for this one, but had to endure it. Yup, the negative reviews are right on the money. This movie is plagued by weak dialogue ("we are tired, we sleep here?") weaker characters (laughable old mother, Diva Plavalaguna ripoff...aww c'mon get real), and the weakest most predictable story (recycled from vastly superior Apocalypto, Mel should get a cut or an apology).The SP effects were inconsistent, needed more sabertooth (or even more "cowbell" for that matter...see how crazy this movie has made me) and what was with those laughable attack chickens (again another apology owed this time to Ice Age).Heck, even when D'Leh makes his big Leader speech to the tribes before the final battle, didn't we already see this scene in 1996 with President Whitmore declaring our Independence Day? Want more ripoffs...how about King Leonidas spear throw on Xeres? Seen it, seen it, seen it!!!Maybe Roland was paying tribute to the genre, but I seriously doubt it. Makes us miss Astronaut Taylor & Nova, heck even Beastmaster Dar & Kiri all did it so much better.Anyway the 1 star is for Evolet for teasing us throughout.After 2 hours the audience was groaning having endured 10000 clich√©s.And if you're thinking about waiting for the DVD, save your hard earned money because nothing can save this Mammoth Razzie!

I must be easily impressed. I am convinced of it or maybe I just love movies too much although there are plenty that I hate. This movie is getting skewered by professional critics and IMDb critics alike and it really does make me second guess my judgment but I've never let the crowd tell me which way to go and I'm not going to start now. I had meager expectations of 10'000 BC, not really sure what to expect and I'm also a HUGE History buff and studied Sumerian religion and culture a lot in High School (yes Sumerian NOT Egyptians like everyone is calling them on here.) More than anything else 10'000 BC is a stunning, jaw dropping spectacle from the hunting of the Mammoths to the incredible pyramid building and battles. If there was ONE thing wrong with this film it was it's rating. I am all for a family film, and I'm not some nasty dude who wants blood, guts and gore in everything I see but this film needed adult content. You needed to see the battle, the ruggedness of their lives and the violence, much like Apocalypto but I do understand wanting to keep options open to make more money. I do believe that 10'000 BC was made not as a historical grand epic that would take home awards but to make money period and it will do that I believe. There is also some common place plot holes and weird little things that could be picked apart but just sit back and watch this spectacle and just enjoy it because I think it's a masterpiece in it's own right.The cast is adequate, I don't think anyone person really stuns or amazes but they are good in their respective roles. Relative newcomer Steven Strait plays the lead hero. A man who grew up believing his father abandoned his people but discovers he is destined to lead his own. He's good and watchable but doesn't light up the screen or anything and doesn't really command and huge presence on screen. Camilla Belle plays his love interest and she is stunning, she really is beautiful especially with those eyes (which are fake) but she really is nothing more than eye candy and a damsel in distress and I think she is or could be better than that. Character actor Cliff Curtis is the elder who longs to teach Strait's character and befriends him. His character could be a lot more important and in the forefront but he's kind of quiet and foreboding and loses a lot because of it. Same goes for Affif Ben Badra who plays a villain that is taken by the lovely Belle. I almost expected some sort of redemption for his character but it never happens, quite the opposite in fact. Oscar nominated veteran actor Omar Sharif is the narrator and they don't use him very much which is unfortunate.It seems like when it comes to the cast they underused a lot of potential exchanging it for visual effects but that works because the CGI is incredible. The saber-tooth tiger, the stunning Mammoths, the pyramids, the main villain or god at the Pyramids was as disturbing as ever. As for historical inaccuracy...I really don't think the film was trying for that BUT it's not as inaccurate as everyone is crying about. The villains in the film are NOT Egyptians, they are Sumerians which a lot of history is mostly legend and lore and I think they do an incredible job at covering that. They even make mention of the possibility of them being from Atlantis, and give a whole actual visual on them putting together the pyramids and the original face of the Sphinx (which looked awful and cartoony but still...) The film is about as PG as you can get, never showing any skin, using foul language or any brutal violence. The battle scenes are still very cool but you'll never see a close up of anyone dying so you can bring your tweens and up to see it which is good. A different spin on historical epic for everyone. Director Roland Emmerich who has done some really incredible stuff (Independence Day) and some very disappointing average stuff (Godzilla) has a real desire to do monstrous things with a budget and sometimes it will work and sometimes it won't. Don't chastise him for wanting to entertain us. He's a good director and you can see it in his style and desire to entertain. I say fight against the harsh critics because if this is the beginning of a summer blockbuster it's pretty incredible!! I loved it!! 9/10

I guess not everyone has the audacity like Mel Gibson in taking risks related to the language used in their movies, for artistic integrity reasons. Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto both did not have their characters spout English, and had subtitles for the audience to rely on instead. And for a movie based in the era that its title states - 10,000 years before the birth of Christ - I do not suppose for one instance that our ancestral forefathers back in those days speak simple English, if at all. Then again, this is entertainment for the masses we're talking about.The main draw of 10,000 BC was of course the interaction of man and humongous, dangerous beasts of the time, and how through ingenuity in our natural ability to milk the Earth to make tools, mankind has ruled the Earth until now. But if like me you're expecting huge action pieces involving mammoths and sabre tooth tigers, what you get in their place are gentle elephants who go on a rampage no different from having computers plaster the correct bodykits over stampeding bulls, and a sabre tooth tiger count of ONE, and a pussy cat at that too.In essence, 10,000 BC tells of so simple a story, you'll believe that back then even hunky guys have their work cut out when they're going after the girl of their dreams. It's basically boy chases girl across the vast mountains and plains of the known world, because he had chosen to honour integrity than to win her hand over a mistaken recognition of bravery. And naturally to make our hero D'leh (Steven Strait) regret this decision, his lady love Evolet (Camilla Belle) and his fellow villages get enslaved and marched to Egypt to build pyramids for the gods (OK, so I'm stretching that last statement). Villains are extremely weak, as they just have to look menacing without actually bringing across the feeling of immense threats that could be fatally carried out.Before you say that it's a carbon copy of the plot in Mel's Apocalypto and many others ranging as far back as Stargate, while Apocalypto had a man trying to save his family, this one's more of a pursuit of individual interests. And through his quest, a hero within D'leh will arise in a sort of coming of age tale of a prophetic savior who will lead everybody to salvation and to the promised land. Yes, tales of The One clich√© get plastered at every possible instance that you'll roll your eyes when the plot tries to throw some red herrings along the way in meek attempts to spice things up. And as each prophecy get explained, the more ridiculous it becomes, and when an ancient badly rendered drawing is shown carved against a rock in colour, you know that this is supposed to be one cartoony movie after all.Throw in some pathos about a long lost father, sacred weapons, and even a memorable fight scene in a bamboo forest (I kid you not this time), you'll have enough material here to feel a sense of familiarity throughout the story, surviving on the novelty of having set some thousands of years ago. One thing you'll learn though, is that it pays being a gatherer and hunter with excellent javelin skills, and even Leonidas will have to kowtow to.

i went with an open mind and a fair deal of expectations about the movie..... but i was left to face was probably one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time... there is no direction to the script or characters... we have vultures flying in the middle of the night and mammoths helping out in building the pyramids...the problem comes out in the fact that none of the characters have depth (not to mention the acting is terrible).. even the graphics have left lot to be desired.... the period in which the movie is set doesn't justify the the behaviour or advancement the human race had made....there should be a law against such movies ..the movie is a must AVOID

OK, after hearing many horrible reviews for 10,000 BC, I have to say that I was really put off, this I was assuming was supposed to be the big kick off to the huge block busters. But I got to see it for free, and I always think that sometimes people just misjudge a film, even though my co-worker warned me, I still went for it and saw it. Thank God the movie ended when it did, I had the neuce around my neck by the end of this film. I mean, seriously, did the "writer" do any history homework?! First off, let's talk about appearances, the "cave men" have perfect teeth, have evolved well for what's supposed to be over 10,000 years ago, and remove the dirt, they're skin belongs in a Neutragina ad. Script? Was there one? I have no idea, the story made absolutely no sense and the ending was horrible. I don't want to give away what happens, but trust me, I think you'll be as confused as I was.I'm going to try my best to explain the plot to you, it's high school drama with cave men, so bare with me. De'Leh is a cave man with his tribe and has earned the title of "best warrior", he is allowed to have any woman, so he picks his childhood sweet heart, Evolet, but he later feels as if he didn't earn that right, so he "gives her up". She is kidnapped by another gang, oh, no! Whatever will he do? He gave her up, but he still digs her and never even got a kiss! So he goes after her with a few of his friends and find themselves fighting saber-tooth's, monstrous snow storms, a snake river, and even a god who got a bad nail job. Oh, let's hope he can save his girlfriend in time and all will be well.That's the Cliff's Notes version I can come up with. May I just say that I absolutely loved how the cave men spoke perfect English, seriously, I didn't realize that it was possible for them to speak that well in American English. This script was written for 12 year old's, seriously. Then they put in these awkward jokes, strange characters that are more laughable than serious, and a love story that would seriously be so non-existent if this was an accurate portrayal of history. I don't mind when they "bend" the truth for dramatic purposes, but this was the friggin' Seasamse Street version of cave men history. Stay away from this trash, it's just a waste of time, sadly, how many good movies could have been made with the budget they probably put onto this film? I'm seeing at least 7 already.1/10

Normally I'm not a fan of Roland Emmerich's movies plainly because they're lacking (1998's Godzilla, Independence Day, The day after tomorrow) but this once is above average and many will find it quite watchable. The story takes place 10,000 years ago in prehistoric Africa where a mammoth hunter D'leh (pronounced delyay) chases after a more advanced civilization who has captured his lover evolet and many other members of his tribe. Though there are quite a number of historical inaccuracies, it makes up for it in CGI, great acting. I must say it was really put together nicely. PROS Amazing CGI Acting Great pacing Action packedCONS A little boring at some parts (Near the end) InaccuraciesOverall rating: 6 out of 10this movie is a decent rent in my book. Check it out.
