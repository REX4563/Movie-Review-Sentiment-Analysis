Hot Fuzz is the story of Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), hardboiled super-cop. Intimidated by his arrest record, his cameo-appearance superior officers (Martin Freeman, Steven Coogan, and Bill Nighy) transfer him from the busy streets of London to the sleepy village of Sandford to keep him out of the way and balance the books, because, to be honest, he's making the rest of them look bad. A big cop in a small town, Angel sees murders and conspiracies where the cameo cast of cops and locals see accidents, but, with the help of his partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), it's not long before he discovers that not everything in Sandford is quite what it seems.Sound clichéd? Good. That's the point. Once settled in Sandford, Hot Fuzz becomes a vehicle designed to send up every action film that has ever taken itself even slightly seriously from Police Story to Point Break, and it does this brilliantly by simply taking everything from these films and pushing them that bit further, making them appear both ridiculous and awesome at the same time. The characters are massively exaggerated (especially Pegg's super-cop and Timothy Dalton's fantastically over-the-top super-villain). The action sequences are outrageous, exciting, and feature a surprising degree of rough justice, perhaps most notably in the form of an old woman getting karate-kicked in the face (or maybe a pub landlord getting his head bear-trapped). The dialogue ranges from obvious parody ("Did you tell him to cool off?") to clever Pegg-Frost exchanges, and even the music is perfectly balanced between action-scene rock songs and mock-epic slow guitar pieces.However, that's not to say that Hot Fuzz is non-stop comic action. The first half an hour or so seems a little slow, but there's no reason to worry; the cast are simply setting up jokes to be knocked down later on, and it is definitely worth the brief wait for the well-paced comic-action masterpiece that's lying just around the corner. As with Shaun of the Dead, the people behind Hot Fuzz are affectionately poking fun at a genre that they clearly love, creating a film that embraces its genre's inherent ridiculousness, and is all the better for it.

After Shaun of the Dead, this second pairing of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost was very high on my wanted list, and it didn't disappoint in the least.Hot Fuzz is crammed full of excellent characters, ranging from the eccentric to the diabolical, and every one gets at least one laugh during the course of the movie and most of them get many more. I don't mean to suggest that this film is wall to wall gags; in fact it is far from it, instead it is just very clever and often very subtle humour that runs continuously throughout the film.Another pleasant surprise was the wonderfully impressive murder scenes, which were pretty gruesome and definitely stood out from the general vibe of the film, which made them far more involving. As well as the comedy and the murders, there is also a genuine sense of mystery surrounding these events and it definitely makes for compulsive viewing.Just in case all that wasn't enough to satisfy you, there is a very action packed and explosive end sequence that is so out of place and ludicrous it works like a charm, and simply caps the film off in style superbly.For me this film was every bit as good as Shaun of the Dead, and its definitely one of the best comedies ever made.9/10

Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, "S*** just got real." Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.The irony in this film is that it takes place in the serenely beautiful English countryside. In some ways, the film is very important for Americans to see. It delves very deeply into the conscious social mannerisms of the English, and parodies the timid insular English village life. Perhaps the most brilliant element of Hot Fuzz is the intertwining of a big-budget action film with gimmicks and a desperately fast pace and a quaint, atmospheric English village given the secrets-of-its-own flavor and a Agatha Christie-style expository structure.The film-making style in and of itself is complicit in the satire. The cinematography and editing is a product of the school of Tony Scott and Guy Ritchie. It's filled with jump cuts accompanied by loud and constantly changing sound effects, occasional strobe, and montages of grainy, bleached out, extravagantly lit shots edited together at machine gun speed. The soundtrack is that of any super-cool action film from Hollywood. This works so well not only as a dead-on impression of Hollywood film-making but also as a hilarious opposition to the English countryside.Simon Pegg's performance is a work of comic genius. His character is so well-developed as a man of invincible and authentic confidence and incredible drive, a workaholic, a zealot, and also an action hero stereotype. Nick Frost is a great second banana because not only is he the punchline to Pegg's straight line, he's also funny in such a direct, adolescent way, an unlikely comic relief sidekick.The film's great surprise is a comeback performance from Timothy Dalton. Not only is it a reappearance from the abyss he's been lost in since his two-year stint as James Bond, but also a vindication against all who've continually dismissed his credibility as an actor and doubted his comic ability. He's very funny and one of the film's great highlights.I've rarely seen a comedy so cleverly written, beautifully directed, atmospheric, or intelligently ridiculous.

Saw this last night at a special screening followed by a Q&A with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I liked "Shaun of the Dead" but wasn't a huge fan but I liked what I'd heard about "Hot Fuzz". I still wasn't prepared to be quite as blown away by it as I was.This film works both as an out-and-out comedy but also as a high paced action film and also manages to showcase the directing talents of Edgar Wright and the acting of Simon Pegg (who can really *act*) The first half is a gentle build up but is generally and genuinely amusing, but once we put the pedal to the floor for the second half the pace is relentless.The plot is substantial enough but isn't really what we've all come to see - it's about the snappy dialogue and the gags. To describe it as a spoof is unfair - they just corrupt the genre a little and turn up the comedy.Great fun from start to finish.

I was lucky enough to see a preview of this film for free after I attended a random screening of Scorcese's the Departed. Naturally hearing that the makers of Shaun of the Dead were behind this I had to go see it - if a group of people can make a romantic comedy with zombies, then a buddy cop film HAD to inventive and original.I can safely say that it was. I haven't laughed as hard in a film as I did with Hot Fuzz. The parts are all cast brilliantly - in particular Pegg and Frost as the two lead police officers.Pegg bringing the smart, intelligent, action hardened London cop to the sleep north England village works in a classic fish out of water scenario. It surprised me with it's direction and I will confess I couldn't have predicted how everything would pan out.When this is fully released I urge you to go and see it.

Hot Fuzz: The story tells us of an over-active 'policeman officer', Nicholas Angel (Played by the co-star of Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg) who is sent to work his duties out in the countryside, to avoid his use of excessive arrests. Suspicions arrive in the town however, as people start getting killed 'accidentally'. Coupled with his rather unprofessional partner Danny Butterman (Similiarily played by Shaun of the Dead star Nick Frost) they get themselves into suspicious circumstances Nicholas Angel fails to ignore.But what can I say? It's just hilarious! An incredibly funny, witty, intelligent British comedy that manages to bring you to tears with laughter and also offers extremely well directed and executed action scenes! If you liked the likes of Shaun of the Dead, you'll love this, simple as that. I was oddly surprised to find that it was incredibly violent, albeit, in a cartoony way, but it will definitely make you squint. Plenty of cameo's by the likes of the hilarious Bill Bailey and a great cast will make this a action/thriller/comedy hard to forget! Excellent.

The incredibly talented team, Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who gave us gems like 'Spaced' and 'Shaun of the Dead' are back with one of the funniest action movies 'Hot Fuzz'. Not only does it brilliantly spoof the American action copper films, it also satirizes the English country-life. There are numerous references to films like 'Point Break', 'Die Hard', 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Bad Boys II' and the conversations where they're brought up are hilarious. 'Hot Fuzz' isn't entirely spoof. It's very much got its own sense of humour and the jokes had me rolling on the floor laughing.The execution is remarkable. It's shot like a slick action film with quick cuts, sharp editing, adrenaline loaded music, heavy sound effects and lots of energy. Not only does this give it the Hollywood action film touch but it effectively contrasts with the calm, peaceful nature of the countryside. The whodunnit suspense element is well built. Even though not much is happening in the first hour, it moves at a very steady pace and there's plenty of comedy to keep the viewer more than entertained.The unique comedic duo Pegg and Frost are fantastic as always. Pegg excellently mimics the typical action hero copper and Frost does an equally fine job of playing the comic sidekick who's the complete opposite of Pegg's Nicolas Angel. They are supported by an equally great cast that includes the always dependable Jim Broadbent, a pleasant surprise called Timothy Dalton and a comically mean Paddy Considine. Note cameos by Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan, Julia Deakin and Cate Blanchett who provide laugh out loud comic relief.'Hot Fuzz' is definitely among the smartest comedies. It induces hysterical laughter. It's got great action adrenaline. It's got chaos in a calm atmosphere. It's got blood. It's got murder. It's got explosions. It has adrenaline. It's got energy. It has weapons. It's got wit. It's got slapstick. It's sarcasm. It's got a swan on the loose. What's not to love?

"It's Frank! He's appointed himself judge, jury, and executioner!"
"He's not Judge Judy and executioner!"

I was lucky enough to see an early preview. I am a big fan of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead, but wow!!!. I have never laughed so much at a film. Even colleagues that weren't that impressed with Shaun of the Dead loved Fuzz.It was non stop comedy, with some action and a little gore but only for comic effect.Essentially a spoof of big action American cop films set in a small sleepy village in Somerset, UK. Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a top cop transferred from London to a place where finding a missing swan is about as exiting as it gets. However, things are about to change as there are a few 'accidents'. Can Angel and his new partner local boy Danny (Frost) find out what's happening.It's got a start studded cast who all add to the sheer brilliance of the script. There are so many memorable bits that keep me giggle to myself as I recall them. I cannot wait until it gets general release so I can see it again. I'm sure I missed a few visual gags and film references.Having it introduced by the stars Simon & Nick was a real bonus. Thanks guys a comic classic.

I love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, i think they are really hilarious and really show typical British men.However i was quite disappointed with this film. Although there were some chuckly bits in it, there wasn't that many "lol" parts which really upset me because Shaun of the Dead was so funny.One thing that was great were the action sequences they were comedic and fast paced which really added to the films entertainment value.Also the storyline was pretty funny...not the best but still OK - of a typically nosy countryside village, everyone in England must know people who live in a village and knows everyone else business - i certainly do!! So it was good to actually poke fun at that.I gave it 7/10-Some laughs -ok story -Great action sequences -brilliant outtakes :)

I was deceived by the 8-10 star ratings that come up on the first dozen reviews in IMDB. Am disappointed by this surprisingly poor work.Some good parts & laughs: first 10 mins, e.g. Angel's interaction with his gf. Inaudible utterances of the old cop and the following translations. "What he said" by some junior cop. Suggested improvement in wordings, like "police officer, not policeman, as later is sexist", "Police service, not police force, as later is aggressive", etc. Angel guessing 'narp', following 'yarp'.Bad: too fast cuts in the scenes (sometimes i watched at 0.8x speed to be able see what the scene wanted to say), lame plot, incredibly bad/childish scenes involving detectives. Repeats of same scene again and again, like denial by local cops was overdone. Some character's reactions are way over the top to make it 'obvious' to the viewer- fit to be in an indian soap serial. Horribly inexplicable the murders, supposedly happening yet noone in the village cares? The murderer explaining their motives to the cop one by one- fit to be in a 90s cheesy Indian movie. Handler of murderer phones him immediately to detail out all his motives for the 'understanding' of the viewer. Even the interview by seniors of Angel in London office scene had poor/cartoonish elements. Just everybody shown previously as normal people on street turn out to be villainous at the end. Horrible gun shootings scene- may fit in a youtuber's first attempt at movie making. Murderer appears out of nowhere, like in slasher movies, but this murderer was standing, in costume in the open, 10 ft from the serious cop.I am used to 4-5 extreme reviews for any movie, but that's ok because reading first 20 or so reviews usually give a fair idea of how good the movie truly is. This one remains a mystery: how come so many 8*+ review even after scrolling down 2-3 times. I would think 3 to 5 stars out of 10 is fair.

"Hot Fuzz" is brilliant! People who like British humor will love this one! It is really funny! It manages to make fun of ridiculous plots used in action movies and at the same time entertain you with their own ridiculous plot which is quite thrilling! Even when you don't get the subtle humor there are more than enough visual jokes to be enjoyed! I thought it was a stroke of genius to use some serious actors like Edward Woodward,Stuart Wilson and Timothy Dalton! (Timothy Dalton was accused of playing a much too serious James Bond! Well,in "Hot Fuzz" he shows that he can be dangerously funny!) As a parody on action movies this movie succeeds where others have failed! I think the credit has to go to the whole team who made this and "Shaun of the dead" including the actors! It shows that they actually like the movies they make fun of! That is essential for the the jokes to work! I thought "Hot Fuzz" is hilarious and very entertaining! It certainly is one of the funniest movies at the moment! Go check it out!

So here we have it, the eagerly awaited follow-up from the same team that brought us Shaun of the Dead. But whereas Shaun (hereafter shortened to SOTD) drew its inspiration primarily from zombie films (more specifically, George Romero's "Dead" films), Hot Fuzz throws its net a bit wider, taking in every buddy-buddy cop action film made in the last 20 odd years and combining it with a very British perspective. Think Midsummer Murder spliced with Bad Boys 2 and you should have the rough idea.Through a series of quick cuts we are introduced to Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), an outstanding officer in the London police force, a super cop with an arrest record 400% higher than anyone else. In fact he's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. So Angel is packed off to the picture-perfect village of Sandford, alone save for his beloved Japanese Peace Lilly. On arrival Angel finds it difficult to adjust to village life, constantly on the look out for crime in a place where there hasn't been a murder for over 20 years and the police station is so quiet that the staff spend most of their time eating cake and ice-cream. He also finds himself partnered with over-eager constable Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny is obsessed with action films and believe's that Angel is his chance to live out his dreams of car chases and gunfights.With the set-up completed within the first 15 minutes it's on with the plot as people start to die in a series of grisly "accidents". Angel is suspicious but no-one believes him apart from Danny. With the body count rising though, the two need to work together to find out what's going on or could it be that Angel is just wound too tightly for country living? Pegg and Frost have been doing their double act for so long it's become second nature and it's nice to see them playing (slightly) different roles. Just like SOTD, they are ably supported by a cast of familiar faces from British film and TV. It's good to see Timothy Dalton having so much fun, playing the sinister Mr Skinner with a moustache-twirling relish. Other standouts include Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as the Andy's, two detectives who spend most of their time verbally abusing Angel and Danny.The film is packed full of references, which I'm sure will take multiple viewings to catch. There's some inventively gory scenes which are sure to make everyone a bit more careful around churches and model villages, though they are a bit too obviously CGI. It's a shame that the action doesn't kick into high gear until the final third but with the plot not going down the most obvious of routes and since I was laughing all the way through I can't really complain. The film is a success in it's attempt to create a "British" action film, combining adrenaline-fuelled action with the mundane and everyday.

London Police Constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a try-hard. He's too good at his job making everybody else look bad. He gets promoted and transferred out into the country. He starts his new job by arresting his new partner Danny (Nick Frost), the son of chief inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Sandford, Gloucestershire seems to be a sleepy little town until a series of murders occurs. Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) owns the local supermarket.Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg mine the plentiful material from cop dramas to bring a dryly funny satirical take on the genre. This has Edgar's quick edit style. Pegg and Frost continue their great chemistry with Edgar for almost a decade. It also serves as a fun whodunnit mystery. It's choked full of big British stars doing cameos. The last act does get overwhelmed with gun action and the guys struggle to maintain the comedy. They took the Bad Boys and Point Break motif too seriously. Overall, this may not be a comedy for everybody but it's a comedy for me.

I had low expectations for a funny, but throw-away film, based on the U.S. trailers.Turns out the trailers I've seen are selling the film at a disservice, because this is one hip, hilarious, smart, and tightly acted / written / edited film.Simon Pegg (Sergeant Nicholas Angel) is top-notch, and is a prolific writer / actor the likes of to which to aspire. He plays a believable hard-nosed / -assed officer, and rarely can be seen wearing "look how funny my writing is" on his sleeve.Nick Frost (PC Danny Butterman), Pegg's rotund subtly faux bumbling partner in the sleepy hamlet to which Angel's been reassigned, is so amazingly committed to his character and actions, he's a real joy to watch.And Timothy Dalton gives probably my favorite performance of his since "The Rocketeer". The way this guy can act and have fun with himself is impressive.Perhaps the strength of the film is its ability to pull off the ludicrous, making me laugh because it's ludicrous, but it doesn't feel unreal. That and being able to pull off the humor and the grotesque side-by-side.Not to give anything away, but the plot twists in the film feel organic to the genre; the "genre" being an Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg film. Almost reverse Scooby-Doo, in a way. Whatever. Brass tacks: I didn't feel jerked around by the plot.I heartily recommend the film. It's a tight, hilarious, surprisingly high-caliber offering for action and comedy fans.

"Shaun of the Dead" was probably one of the funniest (if not the best) British black comedy that had been released in 2004. With gritty violence that made you squirm, innocent humour (Nick Frost) with blaspheming insults that just made you laugh out loud, and the quick wit of Simon Pegg with some great fun and horror mixed together, "Hot Fuzz" had a huge task of competing with the sheer greatness, of which was "Shaun of the Dead".After much keen excitement upon seeing the teaser trailers of Hot Fuzz last year, my stomach churned as if to say "At god damn last, a film I can look forward to in the new year!" I felt as though it was best however, to go in with an open-neutral-mind, as I didn't want to spoil the film with high expectations.I actually was starting to get worried into the first segments of the film, the humour wasn't as sharp as SOTD's first 20 minutes, and there were so many characters to remember, most of whom didn't make sense for a while. It wasn't till Nick Frost was introduced - that the film started picking up its pace and then decided to grab me by the throat. The film from then, was so funny, action packed, gruesome and dark! You just do not expect anything which was what made SOTD so great. The spontaneous actions and humour just kept the film's pace fantastically back on track.The great thing about Hot Fuzz was just how original it was, and the ending (no spoilers here) just gave itself the stamp of "Most Exciting & Fun Ending In British Comedy".The mystery and murder factor was well done as well, leaving me guessing "who did it" all the way through the film, but as with SOTD, the dark and grotesque violence kept its mature rating of 15, very enjoyable, yet very squirming to watch.I highly recommend this film for anyone who just wants a good laugh and likes simple great black comedies. If you loved Shaun of the Dead, you will love this film. Just go in with an open-mind and have fun. Definitely worth the £6.50 (and the £15 when it comes out on DVD)!

I can say it had some moments but when it finally finished I definitely felt I wasted my time. I guess I hung in there because of Shaun of the Dead (which I liked a lot) same director and actor, good reviews, and so on. I guess it was the story, too dumb for me. Too big of a stretch banking on the outlandish ideas and success of "Shaun". But that's OK they tried. It's just that if I had a chance to go back in time and decide to see it, I would not.

I was Lucky enough to be invited to a special trade show of Hot Fuzz and there is little to say that could begin to describe it, awesome is a first step.Thankfully the majority of trailer material happens in the first 15 minutes so you get the bits you know out of the way. i cant really say a lot as it may spoil the film. but if you loved Shaun of the dead you should certainly want to see this.if you have seen spaced and Shaun of the dead you will appreciate the handywork of Edgar Wright. and you will see the return of some of the of the old faces such as spaced landlady MarshaSimon Pegg and Nick Frost both fit into the roles of policemen, sorry officers, well, and Pegg is the usual High Flying guy who is too good for his job, While Frost plays that tag-along soon to become sidekick who doesn't really know uite why he's there.This is totally one you have to see or you will be missing out. if comedy is your thing, this is your film.

Hot Fuzz is the story of Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), hardboiled super-cop.

This film did not get too much play in the USA and I count myself fortunate that I'm close enough to the Canadian border to get these occasional gems broadcast from the CBC. Lucky indeed that the CBC is part of my cable package.Simon Pegg is a too good to be true London police officer who is wracking up arrests and making his colleagues look shameful. It's decided that the place to go to cool that zeal off a bit is the quiet and peaceful rural town of Sandford. In the United Kingdom it's the most crime free zone in the whole country.In fact Pegg looks like he's going to die of sheer boredom. He makes four collars for minor offenses even before he officially is on the job there. It looks like he is not going to be a good fit for this quiet town. The only friend that Pegg has on the Sandford PD is Nick Frost, the somewhat oafish son of Broadbent whom Pegg is assigned as a partner. Frost who just loves American action flicks with guns and car chases would love for there to be something afoot.The story behind Hot Fuzz is really quite bizarre and you'd have to go to the American film The Stepford Wives for a comparison. There are no experiments going on to turn the Sandford women into docile feminine drones, it's a mindset that has taken control of the place. The most sinister character is that of Timothy Dalton who is very much like the Arthur Hill character in The Stepford Wives.This sleeper of a black comedy is really quite a gem. I hope that Hot Fuzz gets discovered on this side of the pond.

After Shaun of the Dead, this second pairing of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost was very high on my wanted list, and it didn't disappoint in the least.Hot Fuzz is crammed full of excellent characters, ranging from the eccentric to the diabolical, and every one gets at least one laugh during the course of the movie and most of them get many more.

It's very much got its own sense of humour and the jokes had me rolling on the floor laughing.The execution is remarkable. It's shot like a slick action film with quick cuts, sharp editing, adrenaline loaded music, heavy sound effects and lots of energy. Not only does this give it the Hollywood action film touch but it effectively contrasts with the calm, peaceful nature of the countryside. The whodunnit suspense element is well built. Even though not much is happening in the first hour, it moves at a very steady pace and there's plenty of comedy to keep the viewer more than entertained.The unique comedic duo Pegg and Frost are fantastic as always. Pegg excellently mimics the typical action hero copper and Frost does an equally fine job of playing the comic sidekick who's the complete opposite of Pegg's Nicolas Angel. They are supported by an equally great cast that includes the always dependable Jim Broadbent, a pleasant surprise called Timothy Dalton and a comically mean Paddy Considine. Note cameos by Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan, Julia Deakin and Cate Blanchett who provide laugh out loud comic relief.'Hot Fuzz' is definitely among the smartest comedies. It induces hysterical laughter. It's got great action adrenaline. It's got chaos in a calm atmosphere. It's got blood. It's got murder. It's got explosions. It has adrenaline. It's got energy. It has weapons. It's got wit. It's got slapstick. It's sarcasm. It's got a swan on the loose. What's not to love?

Hot Fuzz is a brilliant new Britsh comedy that really hits its mark!!! Hands down this fantastic film is the new benchmark in British comedies!Simon Pegg throws you into the extremely tongue in cheek narrative with its quick pace edits, booming sounds and terrific camera work that we have come to expect from Edgar Wright since Shaun of the Dead. Simon Pegg has really exceeded my expectations and credit must also go to Nick Frost who plays the classic sidekick which he accomplishes so well. The aforementioned crafty work by Edgar Wright proves that his style creates some of the best action sequences in the business. Whether it be the shoot'em ups, chase scenes or the jump out of your seat surprises, Wright can really make a film move and does this one ever!!!This is definitely one of those films you have to watch at least twice to come close to getting every single joke, because they come so hard and fast it is sometimes hard to stop laughing at the previous one in time to hear the next.Even though the film does take a lot of twists and turns there isn't really a moment where it lacks energy. Sure there are parts that slow it down, but it needs this to build momentum to one of the most climactic and hysterical pieces in film history. Speed is the key! It keeps this insanely funny narrative flowing while at the same time giving a huge insight into the extremely detailed characters. Each character brings something to the table. It is an inventive yet classic comedy that reaches most audiences with its tongue in cheek and witty humour. People who thought the cop-comedy genre was finished should definitely see this creative film which will pluck those heart strings and have you slapping that knee while feasting your eyes on the adrenaline fueled action!!!

"It's Frank! He's appointed himself judge, jury, and executioner!"
"He's not Judge Judy and executioner!"

I was lucky enough to see an early preview. I am a big fan of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead, but wow!!!. I have never laughed so much at a film. Even colleagues that weren't that impressed with Shaun of the Dead loved Fuzz.It was non stop comedy, with some action and a little gore but only for comic effect.Essentially a spoof of big action American cop films set in a small sleepy village in Somerset, UK. Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a top cop transferred from London to a place where finding a missing swan is about as exiting as it gets. However, things are about to change as there are a few 'accidents'. Can Angel and his new partner local boy Danny (Frost) find out what's happening.It's got a start studded cast who all add to the sheer brilliance of the script. There are so many memorable bits that keep me giggle to myself as I recall them. I cannot wait until it gets general release so I can see it again. I'm sure I missed a few visual gags and film references.Having it introduced by the stars Simon & Nick was a real bonus. Thanks guys a comic classic.

I love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, i think they are really hilarious and really show typical British men.However i was quite disappointed with this film. Although there were some chuckly bits in it, there wasn't that many "lol" parts which really upset me because Shaun of the Dead was so funny.One thing that was great were the action sequences they were comedic and fast paced which really added to the films entertainment value.Also the storyline was pretty funny...not the best but still OK - of a typically nosy countryside village, everyone in England must know people who live in a village and knows everyone else business - i certainly do!! So it was good to actually poke fun at that.I gave it 7/10-Some laughs -ok story -Great action sequences -brilliant outtakes :)

I was deceived by the 8-10 star ratings that come up on the first dozen reviews in IMDB. Am disappointed by this surprisingly poor work.Some good parts & laughs: first 10 mins, e.g. Angel's interaction with his gf. Inaudible utterances of the old cop and the following translations. "What he said" by some junior cop. Suggested improvement in wordings, like "police officer, not policeman, as later is sexist", "Police service, not police force, as later is aggressive", etc. Angel guessing 'narp', following 'yarp'.Bad: too fast cuts in the scenes (sometimes i watched at 0.8x speed to be able see what the scene wanted to say), lame plot, incredibly bad/childish scenes involving detectives. Repeats of same scene again and again, like denial by local cops was overdone. Some character's reactions are way over the top to make it 'obvious' to the viewer- fit to be in an indian soap serial. Horribly inexplicable the murders, supposedly happening yet noone in the village cares? The murderer explaining their motives to the cop one by one- fit to be in a 90s cheesy Indian movie. Handler of murderer phones him immediately to detail out all his motives for the 'understanding' of the viewer. Even the interview by seniors of Angel in London office scene had poor/cartoonish elements. Just everybody shown previously as normal people on street turn out to be villainous at the end. Horrible gun shootings scene- may fit in a youtuber's first attempt at movie making. Murderer appears out of nowhere, like in slasher movies, but this murderer was standing, in costume in the open, 10 ft from the serious cop.I am used to 4-5 extreme reviews for any movie, but that's ok because reading first 20 or so reviews usually give a fair idea of how good the movie truly is. This one remains a mystery: how come so many 8*+ review even after scrolling down 2-3 times. I would think 3 to 5 stars out of 10 is fair.

"Hot Fuzz" is brilliant! People who like British humor will love this one! It is really funny! It manages to make fun of ridiculous plots used in action movies and at the same time entertain you with their own ridiculous plot which is quite thrilling! Even when you don't get the subtle humor there are more than enough visual jokes to be enjoyed! I thought it was a stroke of genius to use some serious actors like Edward Woodward,Stuart Wilson and Timothy Dalton! (Timothy Dalton was accused of playing a much too serious James Bond! Well,in "Hot Fuzz" he shows that he can be dangerously funny!) As a parody on action movies this movie succeeds where others have failed! I think the credit has to go to the whole team who made this and "Shaun of the dead" including the actors! It shows that they actually like the movies they make fun of! That is essential for the the jokes to work! I thought "Hot Fuzz" is hilarious and very entertaining! It certainly is one of the funniest movies at the moment! Go check it out!

So here we have it, the eagerly awaited follow-up from the same team that brought us Shaun of the Dead. But whereas Shaun (hereafter shortened to SOTD) drew its inspiration primarily from zombie films (more specifically, George Romero's "Dead" films), Hot Fuzz throws its net a bit wider, taking in every buddy-buddy cop action film made in the last 20 odd years and combining it with a very British perspective. Think Midsummer Murder spliced with Bad Boys 2 and you should have the rough idea.Through a series of quick cuts we are introduced to Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), an outstanding officer in the London police force, a super cop with an arrest record 400% higher than anyone else. In fact he's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. So Angel is packed off to the picture-perfect village of Sandford, alone save for his beloved Japanese Peace Lilly. On arrival Angel finds it difficult to adjust to village life, constantly on the look out for crime in a place where there hasn't been a murder for over 20 years and the police station is so quiet that the staff spend most of their time eating cake and ice-cream. He also finds himself partnered with over-eager constable Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny is obsessed with action films and believe's that Angel is his chance to live out his dreams of car chases and gunfights.With the set-up completed within the first 15 minutes it's on with the plot as people start to die in a series of grisly "accidents". Angel is suspicious but no-one believes him apart from Danny. With the body count rising though, the two need to work together to find out what's going on or could it be that Angel is just wound too tightly for country living? Pegg and Frost have been doing their double act for so long it's become second nature and it's nice to see them playing (slightly) different roles. Just like SOTD, they are ably supported by a cast of familiar faces from British film and TV. It's good to see Timothy Dalton having so much fun, playing the sinister Mr Skinner with a moustache-twirling relish. Other standouts include Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as the Andy's, two detectives who spend most of their time verbally abusing Angel and Danny.The film is packed full of references, which I'm sure will take multiple viewings to catch. There's some inventively gory scenes which are sure to make everyone a bit more careful around churches and model villages, though they are a bit too obviously CGI. It's a shame that the action doesn't kick into high gear until the final third but with the plot not going down the most obvious of routes and since I was laughing all the way through I can't really complain. The film is a success in it's attempt to create a "British" action film, combining adrenaline-fuelled action with the mundane and everyday.

I will say it out clear and upfront - I love this movie, and without a doubt, a definite contender for my movie of the year. By the filmmakers of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz has everything that makes great entertainment, laced with wry Brit wit, and while it contains plenty of references from their earlier movie, it never bores, and for cinephiles, you're in for one heck of a time identifying the countless of movie references within. If anything, I can't wait to get my hands on their earlier efforts in order not to shortchange myself in missing out on the gems by director Edgar Wright and collaborating writer Simon Pegg.Hot Fuzz follows a typical buddy-cop genre, except that these two are so much more diverse from each other than the conventional cop movies of late milking the obvious race and cultural differences, beaten to death by the Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour films. Here we have the city versus country policeman officers buddying up, each with work ethics belonging to opposite ends. Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is your no-nonsense, straight laced, focused, top supercop who aces everything in his field of work, apprehending felons who fail to follow the law. And with being the top police officer on the beat, the powers that be deem him to be a threat (in making them look inept), and got him posted from Metropolitan London to the countryside of Sandford.And Sandford is your typical small lazy town, where nothing much happens, and everyone knows everyone else. If a missing swan is a great deal, then you'll know there's pretty nothing much to sustain our supercop's interest, especially so when the station he's assigned to have officers which are extremely laid back, which makes him get off on the wrong footing with partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Danny's the anti-thesis of Nicholas, and spends much of his days daydreaming what a top city cop would be like, and lives out his dreams through his collection of DVD movies like Bad Boys II and Point Break. But the idyllic life of the country gets interrupted with a series of murders (frequently brushed aside as accidents) just as our friends are about to get chummy, and here's where the fun kicks in at top gear.There are so many things to like about the movie. The violence is one, though I'm unsure if the commercial release here will keep scenes unscathed by the editing scissors. Featuring some of the most gruesome ways to die, it's a blood splattering fest worthy of any serial killer movie. The movie too rewards the attentive viewer, because while the filmmakers load the movie with plenty of easter eggs, minute details, red herrings and the likes, everything will count for something as they come together on the way to the finale, so keep your eyes wide open and your ears peeled. The dialogue is full of wit, with loads of movie references, direct and indirect, and its run up to the end is one of the most adrenaline pumping in recent times, you can't help but to cheer as you lap up the high octane action. Action fans will not be disappointed.Some may not like its editing style, which is quick, sudden, loud, and at times repetitive, but that's just a minor blip. There are enough positives here to satisfy almost everyone, and one that will definitely bring on a smile by the time the end credits roll. A definite must watch! Don't miss this when it screens commercially!

London Police Constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a try-hard. He's too good at his job making everybody else look bad. He gets promoted and transferred out into the country. He starts his new job by arresting his new partner Danny (Nick Frost), the son of chief inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Sandford, Gloucestershire seems to be a sleepy little town until a series of murders occurs. Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) owns the local supermarket.Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg mine the plentiful material from cop dramas to bring a dryly funny satirical take on the genre. This has Edgar's quick edit style. Pegg and Frost continue their great chemistry with Edgar for almost a decade. It also serves as a fun whodunnit mystery. It's choked full of big British stars doing cameos. The last act does get overwhelmed with gun action and the guys struggle to maintain the comedy. They took the Bad Boys and Point Break motif too seriously. Overall, this may not be a comedy for everybody but it's a comedy for me.

I had low expectations for a funny, but throw-away film, based on the U.S. trailers.Turns out the trailers I've seen are selling the film at a disservice, because this is one hip, hilarious, smart, and tightly acted / written / edited film.Simon Pegg (Sergeant Nicholas Angel) is top-notch, and is a prolific writer / actor the likes of to which to aspire. He plays a believable hard-nosed / -assed officer, and rarely can be seen wearing "look how funny my writing is" on his sleeve.Nick Frost (PC Danny Butterman), Pegg's rotund subtly faux bumbling partner in the sleepy hamlet to which Angel's been reassigned, is so amazingly committed to his character and actions, he's a real joy to watch.And Timothy Dalton gives probably my favorite performance of his since "The Rocketeer". The way this guy can act and have fun with himself is impressive.Perhaps the strength of the film is its ability to pull off the ludicrous, making me laugh because it's ludicrous, but it doesn't feel unreal. That and being able to pull off the humor and the grotesque side-by-side.Not to give anything away, but the plot twists in the film feel organic to the genre; the "genre" being an Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg film. Almost reverse Scooby-Doo, in a way. Whatever. Brass tacks: I didn't feel jerked around by the plot.I heartily recommend the film. It's a tight, hilarious, surprisingly high-caliber offering for action and comedy fans.

The reappraisal of Edgar Wright's work continues with a watching of "Hot Fuzz" - the second of the Cornetto trilogy and, looking back on the trilogy now, having seen them all again, perhaps my least favourite of them.Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a Met officer with a prodigious record. Though effective, he's unpopular and when a promotional opportunity arises his managers quickly ship him to Sandford, a sleepy town in southwest England. His professionalism soon brushes up against the relaxed atmosphere of his colleagues and when a number of people end up dead Angel refuses to accept his colleagues' conclusions, that they are just a series of accidents.I say it's my least favourite of the series, but that doesn't mean that I don't like it (or at least some of it). I'm not really that much of a fan of the sort of action films that "Hot Fuzz" is homaging, so I do find the shootout conclusion of the film a bit tiresome. The earlier aspects of the film are much more interesting though, with the conspiracy and the series of Murders and how that all works. We have all the trademarks of a Wright film here, with the camera being much more dynamic that it was in "Shaun" or the earlier work, the editing to effects and music choices are all there too. The foreshadowing script, that we retrospectively understand that all the trilogy has is present as well.It's also always good to see the chemistry between Pegg and Nick Frost, who plays Danny Butterman, a PC who becomes Angel's confidant and partner. It's nice that despite keeping the pairing across the three films, the dynamic between them is different every time. In S. O. T. D Ed is a lazy and unfocused tie to Shaun's past, keeping him from evolving. Here Danny is the opposite of Nick, and not the brightest of sparks, but one who shows Nick that life is not all about work.It's a fun and entertaining film, though as I say, for me it doesn't work as well as either of the other two films in the trilogy.

"Shaun of the Dead" was probably one of the funniest (if not the best) British black comedy that had been released in 2004. With gritty violence that made you squirm, innocent humour (Nick Frost) with blaspheming insults that just made you laugh out loud, and the quick wit of Simon Pegg with some great fun and horror mixed together, "Hot Fuzz" had a huge task of competing with the sheer greatness, of which was "Shaun of the Dead".After much keen excitement upon seeing the teaser trailers of Hot Fuzz last year, my stomach churned as if to say "At god damn last, a film I can look forward to in the new year!" I felt as though it was best however, to go in with an open-neutral-mind, as I didn't want to spoil the film with high expectations.I actually was starting to get worried into the first segments of the film, the humour wasn't as sharp as SOTD's first 20 minutes, and there were so many characters to remember, most of whom didn't make sense for a while. It wasn't till Nick Frost was introduced - that the film started picking up its pace and then decided to grab me by the throat. The film from then, was so funny, action packed, gruesome and dark! You just do not expect anything which was what made SOTD so great. The spontaneous actions and humour just kept the film's pace fantastically back on track.The great thing about Hot Fuzz was just how original it was, and the ending (no spoilers here) just gave itself the stamp of "Most Exciting & Fun Ending In British Comedy".The mystery and murder factor was well done as well, leaving me guessing "who did it" all the way through the film, but as with SOTD, the dark and grotesque violence kept its mature rating of 15, very enjoyable, yet very squirming to watch.I highly recommend this film for anyone who just wants a good laugh and likes simple great black comedies. If you loved Shaun of the Dead, you will love this film. Just go in with an open-mind and have fun. Definitely worth the £6.50 (and the £15 when it comes out on DVD)!

This was funny and clever in how it pokes fun at all those action cliches and use of foreshadowing. The characters are funny and have good chemistry, it's well shot and of course well acted. It can get boring at times as the scenes do lag on at the end but otherwise, I highly recommend you check it out.

I confess my first reaction to Hot Fuzz was thinking it was droll but a little disappointing after the faster-paced, hilarious Shaun of the Dead. How wrong I was... now I believe this is the funniest Edgar Wright movie. The first act is slower than Shaun, yes, but the script is meticulously crafted, a comedic masterpiece of setups and payoffs.Pegg and Frost are great as the by-the-book city cop and his sloppy partner who have to unravel the mystery behind the killings in a model British village. The duo is surrounded by an inspired cast; Broadbent and Dalton shine as, respectively, the jovial Chief and a smug suspect. Considine and Spall have minor roles but get their share of amusing moments. And a brief scene featuring cameos by Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy is a thing of beauty.Wright is, quite simply, the best comedy director working today. Unlike most of his colleagues he doesn't just rely on witty dialogue and funny performances: he makes the movie *visually* entertaining as well, with his rapid-fire montages, clever transitions and the way he can turn a mundane scene into something hysterical simply by the way he frames a shot.Worth multiple viewings - in fact, Hot Fuzz gets better every time.8,5/10

Hot Fuzz (2007)Coming out of a growing group of British comedies centered on Simon Pegg and a familiar cast, this one takes on small town English sensibilities with typical zaniness. It's a blast. Nerdy London supercop Nicholas Angel is banished to a quaint little village because he's making the London cops look bad. But here he seems unwelcome because he's stirring up trouble—arresting underage drinkers, for example. As mysterious murders begin to accumulate, he sniffs a dastardly conspiracy. With sidekick Nick Frost, something will indeed be done about it.The whole movie is fast and faster, edited with a fury, and in the first ten minutes we get the overachieving nature of our hero and also meet a handful of great British comic forces, including Bill Nighy. But don't get your hopes up—they don't reappear. Still, Pegg and Frost and a host of strong, quirky, smart performers make up the wonderful townspeople, some of them with little comic flourishes that make you laugh out loud. Often.So, yeah, this is comic, for sure, and fast, which means you have to stay on your toes to catch some of the jokes (some plays on words in particular). About two thirds the way through it all, Angel shifts to Clint Eastwood mode (Dirty Harry, that is) and the vigilante cop in all of us (apparently) takes over. At first this is funny, but even a die hard action adventure fan will tire of the endless chasing and shooting and shooting and chasing—it seems to be half an hour. It's not without humor or variety, but in the overall plot, things have come to a halt. Oddly enough.And it ends with a bang. Of course. Enjoyable, yes, and really funny at its best. For any "Shaun of the Dead" fans (which is the lynchpin of this kind of British humor), this movie is a must.

I can say it had some moments but when it finally finished I definitely felt I wasted my time. I guess I hung in there because of Shaun of the Dead (which I liked a lot) same director and actor, good reviews, and so on. I guess it was the story, too dumb for me. Too big of a stretch banking on the outlandish ideas and success of "Shaun". But that's OK they tried. It's just that if I had a chance to go back in time and decide to see it, I would not.

I was Lucky enough to be invited to a special trade show of Hot Fuzz and there is little to say that could begin to describe it, awesome is a first step.Thankfully the majority of trailer material happens in the first 15 minutes so you get the bits you know out of the way. i cant really say a lot as it may spoil the film. but if you loved Shaun of the dead you should certainly want to see this.if you have seen spaced and Shaun of the dead you will appreciate the handywork of Edgar Wright. and you will see the return of some of the of the old faces such as spaced landlady MarshaSimon Pegg and Nick Frost both fit into the roles of policemen, sorry officers, well, and Pegg is the usual High Flying guy who is too good for his job, While Frost plays that tag-along soon to become sidekick who doesn't really know uite why he's there.This is totally one you have to see or you will be missing out. if comedy is your thing, this is your film.
