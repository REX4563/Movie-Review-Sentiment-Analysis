Let's face it. There aren't, if any, good horror classic remakes. Good horror movies are not supposed to be remade, period. However, there are some remakes that come pretty close to "good" remakes, (such as The Ring) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of them. I watched this movie alone in the dark at midnight, with my DTS surround sound speakers, and it scared the HELL out of me! This movie intends to makes you feel damp, filthy and frightening. It takes itself very seriously, no jokes. The horror is non-stop, not allowing you to take a break. The fright and the gore satisfies most horror fans. Good style, good cinematography, well-directed. Of course, this movie cannot be compared to the original, but this is a pretty damn good horror movie itself.

On August 18th, 1973, in Texas, the youths Erin (Jessica Biel), her boy-friend Kemper (Eric Balfour), their friends Andy (Mike Vogel) and Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) and the hitchhiker Pepper (Erica Leerhsen) are returning from a vacation in Mexico to a concert of the Lynnard Skynnard. Kemper is driving his van, when they see a disturbed young woman dangerously wandering on the road. They decide to help her, and the woman commits suicide inside the vehicle. They decide to look for a telephone to call the Sheriff, and they end in the house of Thomas Hewitt (Andrew Bryniarski), where their lives are threatened by the sick Leatherface and his deranged family.I was quite reluctant to see this remake. The original "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a classic, and as I have already written in other reviews, I do not see any reason to release remakes of movies, mainly classics. However, and although unnecessary, this remake is very good. The cast, leaded by the delicious Jessica Biel, have good and convincing performances. The cinematography is great, being very nasty in the property of Leatherface. In the end, I liked this version and I even dare to recommend it. I believe the fans, like me, of the original "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" will not be disappointed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Massacre da Serra El√©trica" ("The Chainsaw Massacre")

SPOILERS (not many)Good news: The 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a chainsaw massacre, and yes, it is in Texas.Bad news: It's boring.Gore belongs in horror movies! But excessive gore? That is harder to pull off. Comically camp horrors such as, say, Braindead, The Evil Dead series, and the three TCM sequels get away with gore because theirs is so excessive as to be absurd. But for a serious horror, gore has to serve its story, not the other way round. Used excessively, played too fast and too loose, gore is exhibitionist, immature, and downright boring.The story of TCM the Original (1974) is simple and straightforward: some dumb kids pick up a loony hitchhiker, visit his loony home, meet his loony family, and wind up at their loony dinner table--some of them as dinner. The violence of the story is mostly implied, occurring off-screen. There is no gore. Had there been gore, TCMtO would have been little more than a snuff film, its audience a passive witness. But horror thrives on an active, not a passive, imagination. By tickling our worst imaginations, the lack of gore only reinforces the horror of the film.The problem with TCM the Remake is not that it is gory (and it is--far moreso than the original, if not the sequels), but that its gore does not serve the story, instead only underscoring its weaknesses, namely a meandering, cruelly confusing plot with characters and scenes that are at once too many and too similar. While the original is admittedly episodic, the remake is all over the place, rushing from scene to repetitive scene, bouncing from character to competing character.Just try to digest this indigestible plot: A group of kids are rude to each other on a road trip; then they are rude to a girl they pick up from the side of the road. Moseying on over to a derelict barbecue joint, they are rude to a little old lady. Then it's off to a derelict mill/junkyard/installation art gallery-cum-sculpture garden to be rude to the banjo kid from Deliverance! They split up, rudely, and one group ends up at the derelict Family House (which, with its plantation architecture, is creepier than the original's), where they are rude to a little old man. After several more scene hops and some judicious dispatching of the cast courtesy our old pal Leatherface (who at 260-odd pounds should cut down on his red meats; I don't know how he keeps up with those kids), a lone survivor escapes into the woods to a derelict trailer, is restored to the derelict Family House, escapes again to a derelict shack, hides in a derelict (or at any rate USDA unapproved) slaughterhouse, and finally ends up back at the derelict barbecue joint. All this, while the white trash Family (here inexplicably surnamed Hewitt) behave very rudely to her indeed.Meanwhile there are subplots afoot!--baby snatching, incest, genetic disease, police conspiracy. The only thing that's missing is the Illuminati. Oh, yeah, and the cannibalism. YES: IN THIS REMAKE OF TCM, THERE IS NO CANNIBALISM. (It's still implied, what with the meat hooks and the slaughterhouse (a nice touch, that, but unfortunately it just meshes together with the other innumerable hide-and-go-seek scenes), but without the original's critical barbecue pit and dinner table scenes the nastiest bit of the horror is lost.)Confused yet? Bored, even?I sure was. For as many changes of scenery as TCMtR has, all of them look the same. I understand how that might be intentional--that's part of the horror, right? that there's no escape?--but how many near-identical shots of Jessica Biel running and hiding and shivering and sucking in her breath in terror are necessary to tell the story?Some of the plot is left unsatisfactorily unexplained, and even more is just plum illogical. For instance, immediately before pulling a gun from--of all places--her bloodied crotch and blowing her brains out in the van, the girl-from-the-roadside tells the kids they're all gonna die. This is what a plucky survivor does when she at long last has a shot to escape her tormentors? Okay, then why not do it earlier, or why not stop the van and do it outside, so she doesn't endanger the kids' lives? Yeah, I know she's supposed to be suffering a breakdown, but her prediction would not have come true had she, herself, not set up the domino effect that made it happen.
The rest of TCMtR is pure Hollywood contrivance. There is the requisite musical score overkill and the squelchy sound effects (remember the creepy, constant drill of the generator from the original? that was rad). There is the snappish MTV editing and direction (compare to the amateurish documentary look and feel of the original). There is the government anti-drug/anti-sex message, and good grief, it is set to "Sweet Home Alabama"!! There is also Jessica Biel in a cowboy hat. Jessica Biel in a wet tee-shirt. Jessica Biel with her head cradled in R. Lee Ermey's naked crotch. (Sheriff Ermey gets to play the best character, a Real Texan who yells and swears and scares the bejesus out of those of us terrified of the South and her reputation for vigilante 'justice' and lynching parties.)Altogether TCMtR comes across as a well-above-average made-for-HBO movie--it's not bad, really, and often it's entertaining; ultimately, though, it sucks on account of sacrificing story to gore. After two solid hours of nonstop jump scenes and bloody murder, of heaping on the bodies and the body parts and the body fluids, we simply acclimate to the violence. The audience become passive witnesses, and the movie becomes predictable, unscary, and boring.Also there's no cannibalism. AND DID I MENTION THERE'S NO CANNIBALISM?!

An idyllic journey in southern Texas driving a van by a group of young people(Jessica Biel,Eric Balfour,Jonathan Tucker,Mike Vogel,Erica Leerhsen) becomes a nightmare when they pick up a young girl. A disgrace is committed and they are looking for the sheriff(R. Lee Ermey). Later, they wind up in the nightmare clutches of a homicidal family who kill and eat passing travellers; finally are pursued by maniac Leatherface wielding a chainsaw.This film contains images of graphic violence and may not be suitable for all audiences. Viewer discretion is advised. The movie packs grisly horror, tension, mayhem, horrible gore and lots of blood and guts. The creepy screenplay by Tobe Hooper-also author of original script- and lavish production by the great Joel Silver along with Hooper. The motion picture is well directed by Marcus Nispel.The film is based on real events about the secluded farmhouse of Plainfield (Wisconsin)handyman Ed Gein,( Leatherface character) who admitted today he disembowelled and butchered the body of old widow, authorities found the decapitated boy hanging in Gein's woodshed, gutted out and strung up by the heels. Investigators have also discovered the head and face of 54 years old woman. Portions of the bodies of ten or more people had also been found among the body parts, human skulls, furniture made of human skill, box full of noses, skin from a human head, a belt made of female nipples, one small skull believed to be that of a six-year-old child. Authorities suspected cannibalism. The Ed Gein grisly killings made horrendously startling to people. The Geins lived a fairly good distance away from Plainfield little town. When we look at Gein's life , we just have this sense of incredible isolation from any human contact, except with his crazy mother. He grew up in a household with an alcoholic and abusive father and a mother who was very domineering. She was a fanatic and did not let Ed or his brother to have much to do with the outside world, because there were sinners out there.The mother denied them any meaningful relationship with the outside world and particularly with women . So Gein grew up with this very powerful ambivalence towards his mother and he developed this resentment and hatred . Gein was looked at as the nerdy kid that his contemporaries would poke fun at, which also tended to confirm for him a lot of his mother's paranoia. Gein's house really was a symbolic representation of what was going on his head. He kept many dentures and human bodies around.Firsly, he started robbing graves. Gein said that he had begun to do this a few years after his mother's death. He almost seemed to take a glee in creating novel artifacts out dead bodies, and various human handiwork .He would make bells made out of nipples and used human shinbones to prop up a coffee table, plus took the tops of skulls and inverted them and used them four soup bowls and upholstered a chair in human skin. Like the film, he cut the faces of corpses and used them as masks and flayed the top of the torso of one of his victims and also created some leggings. After he began to sew together these parts of skin from various corpses, events correctly reflected on this creepy movie.

Unlike many horror fans I never cared much for the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", so I wasn't exactly excited about it being remade with "Seventh Heaven"-star Jessica Biel. Anyway, a friend called one night and we decided to go and watch a horror flick at the theatrs - and they happened to show the remake of "TCM". Little did we know what we were in for.This movie is a torture and I mean that in a positive way. This is horror in its purest form. No jokes, no sex and almost no story at all. Just a killing spree. Whereas the deaths in the "Final Destination"-movies were so over the top that they were funny, TCM's only intention is to freak you out. I would never have thought that a straight forward slasher-flick can be so effective. The Friday The 13th and Halloween franchises, as much as I love them, were always more funny than scary. The sound of Leatherface's chainsaw as he hunts his victims down relentlessly (and somewhat clumsily), however, is really nerve-racking. As a reviewer at bloody-disgusting.com said so appropriately, in the final 30 minutes this movie is like someone tickling you to death. You just wish it would stop already, because you don't think you can take any more. (I read something else at bloody-disgusting, which I find pretty hard to believe: Michael Bay, producer of this ultra-violent, flick sits on the Committee of Directors Against Violence... You're doing a good job, Michael!)Anyway, of course this movie has its bad sides, too. SPOILERS: I reckon, if someone cuts your leg off and puts you on a meat hook you either can't stop screaming or you faint immediately before you DIE! Why wouldn't this guy scream or faint or die? Also, the movie had too much plot at the end. What was the stolen baby good for? And why was this one member of the family, the kid, so helpful? Didn't make sense to me. END OF SPOILERS.In the end Marcus Nispel managed to make a movie superior to the original, much like Gore Verbinski's "The Ring", but not quite as good. New Line, I salute you for giving us so many kick-ass horror movies, full of violence and gore, lately.

Live Reaction / Review for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003): So this is a remake, I hope it's good but its probably impossible to be better than the original. This group of young people seems interesting enough. That girl shot herself, what's going on? I don't remember a little boy in the original. If they were talking with the sheriff on the phone then the other guy dressed as a sheriff, who is he? Damn he destroyed Kemper, that's sad, he seemed like a nice guy. First half of the movie is decent but not great, my rating is 6.5 so far. Let's see if it gets better or worse. Damn, he cut off this guy's leg, intense. The scene with the nails breaking was disturbing. He put salt on his wound? Disturbing. That ''sheriff'' is an absolute psycho. Bruh.. he is wearing Kemper's face, wtf. The movie has suspense, thrills, decent performances, disturbing scenes and overall it's a good movie but not great. Its a solid 7/10 for me.

Horrors have a bad reputation for poor sequels and bad remakes, which is why when people heard there was a remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the general thought was that they would be butchering the classic(excuse the pun). However this is a terrifying, shocking, emotional thrill of a movie. It may not be up to the standards of the 1970s version, but to be fair, nothing is. The acting is quite well done. The film takes advantage of the time its being made in and the budget, with this version having much better production values, its much more gory but not at the cost of story telling.The realism is superb and the movie is, at times, as sad as it is scary due to the emotional torture of the characters, i'm sure many people will say its not as good as the original but it could have been a lot worse

The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a great film. On a miniscule budget, Tobe Hooper managed to create a classic horror movie, who's title is known worldwide. This remake is nothing like the original. If anything, it's LESS gory, and not scary at all. The thing that makes the original scary is the sheer insanity of all the killing, and all the other things that happen to the main character (the dinner scene, for example...watching it still makes me want to cover my eyes). All the "horror" of the new version is from the old "surprise!...something jumps out of hiding and makes a loud sound" trick. By the end of the movie (which is about 30 min. longer than the original), I'd seen the "surprise!" trick so many times that I didn't even blink at it anymore.***MINOR SPOILER ALERT*** * * * One last complaint about this remake (and it's a BIG one). Leatherface takes off his mask. In fact, other members of his family try to make the victims pity him by explaining that he was disfigured by a childhood disease. The point of the mask, according to Tobe Hooper was that Leatherface didn't have a personality or background of any sort. It's scarier that way. ***END SPOILER***Final Verdict: Every time somebody buys a ticket for this movie, God kills a baby dolphin. It's that bad.

*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*For all you kiddies out there, here is the movie that will make you pee in your little britches. Teens should love this movie: after all it has a big breasted Jessica Biel to ogle over; it has a slick and polished music video look that the TRL lovers will go for; it has young love and lust, including a fledgling marriage and a never-to-be used engagement ring, shown in a tragic scene that's sure to make the teenage girlies whine in unison; and of course it has enough digitized chainsaw sound effects to make the teens jump in their seats and cover their eyes.The sad thing about this remake, is that it has spawned a generation full of people who think this is what a horror movie should be. And yet another sad fact, is that some teenagers believe this movie contains real footage, and there's still a leatherface running around out there in Texas somewhere. I bet high school hallways are ripe with ditzy comments on leatherface's whereabouts. And yet sadder still, most teens probably believe this remake is better than the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.After all of this I probably come off sounding like an old curmudgeon, but if you've ever been on the TCM remake message board, you'd get the same impression as I.Don't get me wrong; the teenagers will eat this movie up. It was after all, made for the teen market. But any TRUE fan of the original TCM will be very disappointed in this unintelligent, hollywoodized remake.So if you're a teen, out looking for a decent horror movie to see, I suggest you see this remake, you have license to see it. But if you're a mature movie viewer, especially a horror fan, and you go see this movie and end up liking this god-awful remake; you should be ashamed of yourself.
