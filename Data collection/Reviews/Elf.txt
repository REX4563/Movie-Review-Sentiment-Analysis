After seeing "Elf" last night (special preview screening) I am happy to say that I, as well as my children left the theater feeling full of Christmas cheer. I do believe that this movie will become a Christmas classic. I can see this movie being viewed by millions each year on TV just like "A Christmas Story", and "It's a Wonderful Life". Was the movie perfect? No. Will it win an Oscar? Of course not. Did it make me laugh, and feel good while looking forward to another Christmas this year. Without a doubt.
7 out of 10 Stars.

Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly clich√© ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer).  Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.  The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit.

This is a good natured holiday comedy that definitely is in the same realm as "The Santa Clause" and (Dare I say?) "Miracle on 34th Street". Story is about a human that has been raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole and as he gets older he figures out that he's very different from the other elves. Years earlier Santa (Ed Asner) was delivering at an orphanage and a human baby accidentally crawled into his sack and was taken back to the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). He is called Buddy (Will Ferrell) and he grows to six foot three and one day he is told the truth about his situation and told by Santa who his real father is. Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and he heads to the Empire State Building where he works. He finds his father Walter (James Caan) who runs a publishing business and works all the time much to the chagrin of his family. Walter is unable to get away from Buddy and after a blood test proves he is his son he takes him home with him to stay with his family. He meets Walter's wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and their son and Walter thinks Buddy is just someone reverting to his childhood after a shock. Buddy starts to work in a department store and he meets a woman named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) and is smitten by her. Buddy tries to fit in with the others but finds it difficult although he becomes friends with Walter's son and starts dating Jovie.This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like "Made" and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting "Dinner For 5" on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all, it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says "Hell" once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace, it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier, this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!

This was my 4th viewing and now ready to review.The story is insane. This film should not have worked. But almost as a tribute to the X-Mas miracles it tries to riff off, it is an astonishingly entertaining film.Behind the camera Favreau, Mr Money Shot, who has quietly without fanfare turned into one of the hottest directors in Hollywood history. In front of the camera Farell who I usually don't care for but may just give the performance of his career here. A script to die for. Probably the best use of Zoey D's looks in her career to date.Way under rated and unappreciated.As in my other reviews, most "recent" X-Mas films (since about 2000) are Canadian B-movies shot on a budget which would barely cover a reno on THIS OLD HOUSE What an unexpected treat See it

Confession time: Until just a couple of hours ago, I had never seen this now-classic Christmas comedy starring Will Ferrell in the title role. He's an actual human who as a baby was taken to the North Pole accidentally and was raised by elder elf Bob Newhart. After becoming the least prolific of workers at Santa's Workshop, he decides to go to New York to find his biological father who's played by James Caan. I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny and had also some touching scenes. Because this was a family film, there's no dirty language nor any adult situations. In summary, Elf is a wonderful comedy suitable for kids "from 1 to 92"!

After 20 years of thinking it would probably be a silly waste of time and listening to the naysayers (like my husband) that it was stupid. So, if you are like me and haven't watched this, then put on your childlike wonder, forget that you are a grown-up and enjoy this very enjoyable and funny movie. Chill out and laugh out loud. Bob Newhart is hilarious as papa Elf and Ed Asner plays a marvelous Santa.Now I understand why Zooey Deschanel now has black hair, because in this movie she has blond hair and it does not suit her well.Give this movie a chance, don't wait 20 years to watch it like I did!

I remember when I saw "Elf" in the theater. I thought it was pretty funny. I never would have guessed that 17 years later it would become a Christmas classic. There are a lot of laughs in this movie. There's also a lot of good music. The cast is very likeable, especially a dreamy Zooey Deschanel. They all do a nice job. "Elf" has so much goodwill going for it that it almost gets over its bumps in the road. For some reason, it's never a completely satisfying watch with me.

The film is something quite intriguing with a very unique plotline; from the beginning it looks to be very promising and, is, in fact, promising. However, it misses a certain something that becomes more apparent throughout the film: after a while the pure immaturity of the Elf slowly begins to wear away on you until the film loses all of the original appeal that it had.
Nonetheless, the film has some delightfully entertaining and hilarious portions, though overall it leaves much to be desired. The ending drags out painfully and becomes torturingly corny, nothing that is unpredictable about it. In spite of the ups and downs that one has when watching the film, it can still be called a decent film. There was some very good exercise of comedy and admittedly it is superior to many of the films that have come out, but if you were hoping for anything more than just a slightly entertaining film, you will be disappointed. Aside from the minimal comedy to keep you interested nothing more is offered by the story.The movie should make you laugh, and the movie is worth seeing, but again, it is far less than the Christmas classic that people are claiming.

Will Ferrell does a great job here, and it's the perfect Christmas (Holiday) movie that can be enjoyed anytime of the year.The contrast of almost unbalanced folly of Will's character with those that encompass him, lends a great degree of innocence and non-stop joy and plenty of laughter as he leaves the mundane world of the usual, boring, and often time intolerance of the world in his dust.It's refreshing to see a story where others are encouraged to rise to the level of this main character instead of him being overwhelmed and dragged down by the majority of "Cotten Headed Ninny Muggins", a.k.a. the "touch me not, speak to me not" big city public psyche so familiar that many walk around with.For those that represent the general public in the movie, as well as the audience, Ferrell's character dares us to believe again, even for a moment of the magic of Christmas and tears down decades of political correctness to connect us with the late 60s and 70s when so many annual Holiday shows brought us a seemingly sustained desire to entertain ourselves with the magic that waxes then wanes but for a few short weeks each year. Whether a work of animation or raw theater, this refreshing story brings vitality and rekindles childhood memories for the kid in all of us.

Timeless classic. Will Farrell crushes it as Buddy, the title character. Feel good family film.

This film is about a man (Farrel) who had just learned that he was born human! He never knew that he was human and he imagined that he was an elf the whole time! Now he needs to search for his biological father instead of his elf father. He finds him but his father won't believe it. They take a DNA test and you know what? He is his father! I must say this film entertained me a lot! It' actually really funny and I wasn't expecting from it that much. This film made me cry from its sweet moments. This is also a great film for the family looking for a great Christmas movie to watch. The adults won't get bored and the kids will have the time of their lives! The special effects are great to see. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen this movie to see it!

It was so nice to be able to sit down and watch a movie featuring an SNL actor without having to mute or fast forward any crude parts. Granted, this may not be Will Farrell's most amazing performance, but if you want a new Christmas movie to watch this season, I highly recommend Elf. I talked to a few people who thought the movie was stupid, but that was because they were expecting Will Farrell's character to be a duplicate of his SNL performances. So, to fully enjoy this movie, watch it without any expectations and remember that it's okay to have a childlike sense of humor--nobody's too cool for a great Christmas movie. I love most all the movies from Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Will Farrell, Jim Carrey, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, and David Spade, but most of them aren't appropriate for viewers of all ages. Elf is a movie you can throw in the VCR and not have to worry about what the kids hear or see on it. Thanks, Will, for putting out a hilarious movie that the whole family can watch!

Elf is a fun Christmas film that has a guy living as an elf then going to the ordinary human society. I feel like that led to good humor throughout and I find kinda interesting. For me, it's within my top 5 Christmas movies. I feel like Will Ferrell did a good job as Buddy. He really nailed the hyper personality. It's a role that I really tie to Ferrell, I can't see anyone else playing the role. Also this is the first role that comes to my mind when someone says Will Ferrell. This movie helps bring a more well defined definition of Christmas spirit. It's about being together and believing it. Seeing something may not be the same as believing something. You could take the quote from the Santa Clause and apply it here. "Seeing isn't believing, believing is seeing!" I feel like this is full of Christmas spirit and a must watch during the Christmas season.

This is the kind of Christmas movie you should be watching every 25th of December apart from your usuals. It's a wonderful story, with a strong Will Ferrell, playing an innocent, child-like, distracted elf who has no idea how the real world functions, as he is on the quest to search for his real family. He is willing to spread the Christmas spirit on a city which apparently hasn't got the spark in its eyes, so there is a hard task on his hands.The rest of the cast is wonderfully completed by Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Daniel Tay, with Peter Dinklage and Bob Newhart in small roles. Ferrell definitely steals the movie; and his troubled relationship with his father (Caan) provides some funny and touching moments as well. Jon Favreau did quite a good job from the director's chair, turning this seemingly childish film into a marvelous choice for your Christmas movies of every year. Some even regard it as a classic, but well, I will let you be the judge of that.

After rewatching this movie with my Mum last week on Friday night for its 20th anniversary on Netflix here's my spoiler-free review of Elf! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, my favourite moments & childhood memories of watching it and my conclusion/rating! This was released before Zathura: A Space Adventure, before Iron Man & before The Mandalorian which Jon Favreau would later work on those projects! This film has the late great Edward Asner who plays Santa Claus sadly he passed away in August 2 years ago same as James Caan who we lost a year ago! Will Ferrell is so funny in this he even played Alex Trebek in Celebrity Jeopardy! For SNL. This is a more family-friendly Christmas flick than Love Actually where that's an adult Christmas movie! I've been to New York City twice once in 2007 on my first trip to America with my family of 4 (Dad, Mum, brother Jordy and me) & again 10 years later in 2017 with Mum and Dad! I do want to find the original Ray's Pizza & taste test them! Overall this timeless Christmas classic still holds up after 20 years and I might even watch Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas! That's why I'm giving this a 7/10! Go watch it on live TV or Netflix (if you have an account) & you'll enjoy it as much as I did! Merry Christmas everyone! ;-)

Over the years this has become a classic, it never gets old! Funny and heartfelt, this Christmas movie is sure to put a smile on anyone's face. Love watching this movie every year with family!

I don't think this movie is bad, in fact whenever I have nothing better to do BUT watch this film I enjoy my time with it. But I don't get the praise or why it has garnered "Christmas Classic," status. I'm sure I am missing something, but my complaints have already been vaguely explained up above.

As a general rule, I don't like Will Ferrel movies, I find his over the top acting annoying and simply not funny. Elf was no exception.
I watched Elf because it was hailed as the best Christmas movie of all times, I don't agree with that at all. It did have some cute elements that would have made an enjoyable film, but the annoying antics of Ferrel didn't work for me.
But clearly I am in the minority - so there is that.

Elf (2003)I sure wish they would have released this movie in December, it would have given it an even Christmas-ier spirit to it all. Elf was a hilarious movie about a guy named Buddy (Will Ferrel), who was raised by elves at the North Pole. He then discovers he isn't an elf, and travels to New York city to find his real father (James Caan). It turns out his that Buddy has a stepbrother and a stepmother (Mary Steenburghen). While there, he meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) at a store there, and falls in love. This movie is all about Christmas spirit and is wonderful and enjoyable. It's a great family movie. You should take you ands your family to it during the holiday season. This will be one of those Christmas movies that I will be able to watch over and over. I give Elf a 10/10.

After seeing "Elf" last night (special preview screening) I am happy to say that I, as well as my children left the theater feeling full of Christmas cheer. I do believe that this movie will become a Christmas classic. I can see this movie being viewed by millions each year on TV just like "A Christmas Story", and "It's a Wonderful Life". Was the movie perfect? No. Will it win an Oscar? Of course not. Did it make me laugh, and feel good while looking forward to another Christmas this year. Without a doubt.

Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of "Elf" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****

This was one of my favorite movies in 2003. Will Ferrell is brilliant as the Elf. The supporting cast is great too, especially Bob Newhart as his elf "dad". The characters are well written and it is a refreshing film to get lost in. Will Ferrell plays the elf with such innocence, he is so funny! This is not just a Christmas film but when the DVD comes out I will be watching "Elf" in July. The story progresses nicely, there are many lessons to be learned as you watch this movie. It touched my heart in many ways. I highly recommend this movie for kids AND adults, you won't regret it. Treat yourself and watch this "original" movie. Hollywood needs to make more like this.

The film is something quite intriguing with a very unique plotline; from the beginning it looks to be very promising and, is, in fact, promising. However, it misses a certain something that becomes more apparent throughout the film: after a while the pure immaturity of the Elf slowly begins to wear away on you until the film loses all of the original appeal that it had.

ELF (2003) *** 1/2 Will Ferrell, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Edward Asner, Bob Newhart, Zooey Daschanel, Daniel Tay, Amy Sedaris, Faizon Love, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass, Michael Lerner, Artie Lange, Peter Billingsley, Peter Dinklage, Claire Lautier, Jon Favreau. Ferrell gives an inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The North Pole and discovers to his dismay he's actually human sparking his quest to be re-united with his long-lost father (Caan in an inspired bit of casting), a 'naughty-list' occupant, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City, just in time for Christmas. Hysterically funny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell (no one else could pull off the razor's edge of looking like an idiot yet retaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks' turn in 'BIG') with a great cast especially the beguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa's Little Helper at Gimbels'who he falls in love with. Directed with style and witty warmth by Favreau (who has a cameo) and written by newcomer David Berenbaum with a smart, fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nod to classic animated holiday specials for good measure. An instant holiday classic. Trivia note: Billingsley, best known as Ralphie from the yuletide cinematic classic, plays 'A CHRISTMAS STORY' the elf foreman!

This film is about a man (Farrel) who had just learned that he was born human! He never knew that he was human and he imagined that he was an elf the whole time! Now he needs to search for his biological father instead of his elf father. He finds him but his father won't believe it. They take a DNA test and you know what? He is his father! I must say this film entertained me a lot! It' actually really funny and I wasn't expecting from it that much. This film made me cry from its sweet moments. This is also a great film for the family looking for a great Christmas movie to watch. The adults won't get bored and the kids will have the time of their lives! The special effects are great to see. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen this movie to see it!

It was so nice to be able to sit down and watch a movie featuring an SNL actor without having to mute or fast forward any crude parts. Granted, this may not be Will Farrell's most amazing performance, but if you want a new Christmas movie to watch this season, I highly recommend Elf. I talked to a few people who thought the movie was stupid, but that was because they were expecting Will Farrell's character to be a duplicate of his SNL performances. So, to fully enjoy this movie, watch it without any expectations and remember that it's okay to have a childlike sense of humor--nobody's too cool for a great Christmas movie. I love most all the movies from Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Will Farrell, Jim Carrey, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, and David Spade, but most of them aren't appropriate for viewers of all ages. Elf is a movie you can throw in the VCR and not have to worry about what the kids hear or see on it. Thanks, Will, for putting out a hilarious movie that the whole family can watch!

Elf is a fun Christmas film that has a guy living as an elf then going to the ordinary human society. I feel like that led to good humor throughout and I find kinda interesting. For me, it's within my top 5 Christmas movies. I feel like Will Ferrell did a good job as Buddy. He really nailed the hyper personality. It's a role that I really tie to Ferrell, I can't see anyone else playing the role. Also this is the first role that comes to my mind when someone says Will Ferrell. This movie helps bring a more well defined definition of Christmas spirit. It's about being together and believing it. Seeing something may not be the same as believing something. You could take the quote from the Santa Clause and apply it here. "Seeing isn't believing, believing is seeing!" I feel like this is full of Christmas spirit and a must watch during the Christmas season.

This is the kind of Christmas movie you should be watching every 25th of December apart from your usuals. It's a wonderful story, with a strong Will Ferrell, playing an innocent, child-like, distracted elf who has no idea how the real world functions, as he is on the quest to search for his real family. He is willing to spread the Christmas spirit on a city which apparently hasn't got the spark in its eyes, so there is a hard task on his hands.The rest of the cast is wonderfully completed by Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Daniel Tay, with Peter Dinklage and Bob Newhart in small roles. Ferrell definitely steals the movie; and his troubled relationship with his father (Caan) provides some funny and touching moments as well. Jon Favreau did quite a good job from the director's chair, turning this seemingly childish film into a marvelous choice for your Christmas movies of every year. Some even regard it as a classic, but well, I will let you be the judge of that.

After rewatching this movie with my Mum last week on Friday night for its 20th anniversary on Netflix here's my spoiler-free review of Elf! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, my favourite moments & childhood memories of watching it and my conclusion/rating! This was released before Zathura: A Space Adventure, before Iron Man & before The Mandalorian which Jon Favreau would later work on those projects! This film has the late great Edward Asner who plays Santa Claus sadly he passed away in August 2 years ago same as James Caan who we lost a year ago! Will Ferrell is so funny in this he even played Alex Trebek in Celebrity Jeopardy! For SNL. This is a more family-friendly Christmas flick than Love Actually where that's an adult Christmas movie! I've been to New York City twice once in 2007 on my first trip to America with my family of 4 (Dad, Mum, brother Jordy and me) & again 10 years later in 2017 with Mum and Dad! I do want to find the original Ray's Pizza & taste test them! Overall this timeless Christmas classic still holds up after 20 years and I might even watch Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas! That's why I'm giving this a 7/10! Go watch it on live TV or Netflix (if you have an account) & you'll enjoy it as much as I did! Merry Christmas everyone! ;-)

This is the greatest Christmas movie mlm of all time and it deserves at least an 8 out of 10.

Buddy (Will Ferrell) is a human brought up in the world of Elves at Santa's grotto in the North Pole by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). When he finally realises he doesn't seem to fit in, he asks Papa Elf and learns that his dad (James Caan) lives in New York and he's on Santa's naughty list. So off he goes on a quest to find him.Elf is charming and funny throughout and Buddy's naivety in the big apple is an over-used premise that works with charm. He also meets a department store Elf (Zooey Deschanel) bringing a little romance to the tale.OK its full of clich√©s and the basic plot has been done to death, but the film is still a winner that cannot fail to entertain on some level.7/10

Over the years this has become a classic, it never gets old! Funny and heartfelt, this Christmas movie is sure to put a smile on anyone's face. Love watching this movie every year with family!

I don't think this movie is bad, in fact whenever I have nothing better to do BUT watch this film I enjoy my time with it. But I don't get the praise or why it has garnered "Christmas Classic," status. I'm sure I am missing something, but my complaints have already been vaguely explained up above.

As a general rule, I don't like Will Ferrel movies, I find his over the top acting annoying and simply not funny. Elf was no exception.
I watched Elf because it was hailed as the best Christmas movie of all times, I don't agree with that at all. It did have some cute elements that would have made an enjoyable film, but the annoying antics of Ferrel didn't work for me.
But clearly I am in the minority - so there is that.

Elf (2003)I sure wish they would have released this movie in December, it would have given it an even Christmas-ier spirit to it all. Elf was a hilarious movie about a guy named Buddy (Will Ferrel), who was raised by elves at the North Pole. He then discovers he isn't an elf, and travels to New York city to find his real father (James Caan). It turns out his that Buddy has a stepbrother and a stepmother (Mary Steenburghen). While there, he meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) at a store there, and falls in love. This movie is all about Christmas spirit and is wonderful and enjoyable. It's a great family movie. You should take you ands your family to it during the holiday season. This will be one of those Christmas movies that I will be able to watch over and over. I give Elf a 10/10.
