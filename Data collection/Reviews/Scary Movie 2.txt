I totally understand that this film and all of the scary movie films are pretty terrible films but I just can't help but love them! The comedy in this film is right up my street, it's ridiculous and it makes fun of all the classic horror films that I love. The comedy is just pure crude and I find it absolutely hilarious and will always film it funny. This is a great film to watch with friends and have a good laugh with, it's just contagious once one person if laughing. I will forever think that this movie is the best of the series and I think that is hands down because of the cast, how did they get Tim Curry in this thing? I will never know! Overall though I just love this movie and I don't care what anyone says as this will always be up there for movies to have a laugh to. I love it!

"Scary Movie 2" is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies.This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.This movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I don't think you will like it nearly as much.

I have various mixed emotions about this sequel to the hit SCARY MOVIE. It wasn't as good but it delivered many laughs and slap-on-knees. I was a little surprised at this one on how they could spoof any movie right after the other. If you really liked the first one, you could be disappointed or satisfied with this one. I was satisfied. 7/10My MPAA rating: R for strong crude sexual content and humor, drug use and language.

A quick warning.  Some things I say here might be construed as spoilers. So if you're really worried about me giving away some joke or plot point of ScaryMovie 2, beware my spoilers and read no further.  But personally, I don't think anything could spoil this movie any more than it has spoiled itself.Part of the advertising campaign for Scary Movie was that there would be nosequel.  I wish with every fiber of my critical mind that the Wayans had been true to their word.Scary Movie was quite funny.  Somehow, they managed to successfully parodya self-parodying genre.  This, I think, is mostly because the creative team wasn't afraid to push limits of tastefulness (-lessness), and there was a certaininnocence to their humour.  A crass innocence, lacking in the sophistication of a Zucker/Abrahams production like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, but a simplicity of style in the way the jokes were told.  While neither film has a grasp on comic pacing, the jokes of the first film still landed.  And I laughed.Scary Movie 2, however, is a complete and total failure on all levels. Riding the success of the first, the Wayans pump up the bodily-fluid jokes, none of which are amusing.  Some, in fact, are direct replicas of the jokes in the first. They also seem to believe that it is funny when someone says "motherf***er" for noreason, in an inappropriate instance.  And it can be funny.  When usedsparingly, the shock value of that kind of gag breaks the tension of a scene, and with a proper set up, will illicit laughter.  It is not funny, however, when that is the punch line of literally every other exchange of dialogue (variations includecharacters saying: "f*** this," and "shut the f*** up," among others).
This relates directly to one of the fundamental flaws of the film, which is that there is never any tension, or solid foundation of a joke, ever established. A great joke starts out like a string pulled tighter and tighter until one of two things happens: either it breaks from its own tension or it is cut.  Mike Myers is the master of pulling the string until it snaps of its own accord; as in the Austin Powers movies, he holds off on a punch line, or drags one out, for so long that it eventually becomes funny (consider his villains laughing diabolically for two whole minutes in the first film).  Either that, or the setup, with no superfluous distractions, is clean, taut, and then cut at the appropriate moment.  In Scary Movie 2, the Wayans try and fit so many stupid things into one scene or onejoke, that, as a result, the setup is never clean, and the punch line never lands. Rarely, in fact, is there a punch line.  Also, we see characters repeatedly cutting the tension by commenting on their surroundings (self-reference is dangerousin comedy... it fails as often as it works).  At one moment, a character can deliver an absurd line with no one noticing it, and then in the next, a character might comment on a similar line by saying "that's a stupid thing to say." Consider two situations: in the first, the audience sees some food tampered with, or tainted in a disgusting manner, which is then consumed by a character in the film. In the second, the character sees the food tainted, is obviously and vocally disgusted, and simply does not eat.  The first can be (though not always) funny becausethe reaction is elicited on the part of the AUDIENCE.  The AUDIENCE shouldfeel disgusted, or should laugh at the situation, not the characters.  We know something the characters do not.  This creates the tension and the release for us.  Scary Movie 2 repeatedly opts for the second type of joke.  There is notension, no mystery, and absolutely no funny.  Likewise, half the time, thecharacters are scared and the other half they recognize that their world is one of parody and comedy.  Characters in a parody must accept and address theirpredicament with life or death seriousness, or it kills the comedy. Consider Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun films.  To Frank Drebin, everything wasserious.  It was how seriously he treated absurd situations that made it funny.There is also very little effective parody, if any.  Movies are not parodied here. They are merely referenced.  Just because I recognize variances on scenesfrom the Exorcist, Mission Impossible 2, Charlie's Angels, etc. doesn't meanthey're funny.  The source material is not mocked, commented on, or made light of in any capacity at all.  They are merely replicated with swearing and sex- jokes tacked on.Finally, the film can't settle on a tone.  In one scene (in fact, in many scenes), a character is sprayed or covered in some disgusting substance, only to be clean and rid of it in the next.  Fine.  Perfect.  That's the way these movies work.  But in another scene, ridiculous occurrences (such as getting in a fistfight with apossessed cat who handles a broken bottle) are treated with a seriousness and meaning by the characters involved.  One character supposedly has carnalinteractions with a ghost/monster, and the issue is dropped.  Another does the same thing, and it becomes a plot point. Either this is a movie that exists as a coherent story or exists as essentially a series of sketches with punch lines, but it can't be both.  Actually, that's not true.  Films made by brilliant comedians can do both, because they understand the nuances of their craft.  The Scary Movies are not made by craftsmen.  They are made by fart-joke purveyors.  The first film embraced that.The second film is a little too ambitious, an 82-minute marathon of poor setups and no laughs, all the while wishing it could be a real movie that tells a story. What scares me the most is that Scary Movie 2 is part of a trilogy.  May themovie gods save us all.  Rating (1/10)

Although not quite as funny as the original, I still enjoyed Scary Movie 2 very much. While some bits are downright idiotic, some are genuinely hilarious, and will have you rolling in the aisles. If you're not a fan of Scary Movie, you won't like this one either, however. But, if you enjoyed the first, come back to see this one too.

I can't believe how bad this movie is. The entire movie revolves around extremely crude stupid sexual jokes, anything somewhat funny is already covered in the trailers. I would give this movie a - 4 if it were possible. Please try to avoid this movie at all costs. It is one of the worst i have ever seen.

It was good when I was a kid. But it aged like moldy cheese.2.5/5 + 1 for the golden days of cheap early 2000s comedy.

This is easily the worst film I have ever seen. When I saw the first I was 15 and like most low to mid teen males I found it funny although looking back it really was a stupid waste of time. This sequel, however, is absolute tosh. The production values are unbelievably atrocious and not in a funny or camp way. Everything looks as though it was strapped together with duct-tape. The jokes are not funny in the slightest. The spoofs are unjustified and every single gag is just plain gross, opting for the lowest common denominator every time. Toilet humour is the name of the game and toilet humour is practically all you are going to get. I actually felt sorry for the actors in this film as I can not imagine how degrading and career destroying it must have been to appear on such unbridled trash. It is a sad tragedy that such films can make it to cinemas. Do not see this film, it physically hurts your eyes and brain to do so.

This movie is great and what I think is an awesome installment. This is a film I watched over and over at one point in my life when I was younger. I love the comedy and the differing cast! I don't like how at times the sketches/scenes can feel stitched together or out of place. This sequel technically makes no sense due to Ray being a villain in the first Scary Movie, but I guess they let bygones be bygones. Over all a great addition!

I might have to do some checking up on this, but I'm pretty sure that seven writers is a record high for a non-anthology film. And just what is this cinematic treat scripted with so many pens? It's probably really good, right? I mean, with seven writers, it would have to be extremely goodor very, very bad. Unfortunately, it is the latter, and the movie is `Scary Movie 2.' This sequel of the funny teen-horror spoof `Scary Movie' has none of the subtleties, parodies, or even big laughs the original film did. Instead, it digresses to overtly sexual and gross-out humor which doesn't even work on a gut level. I feel sorry for every person associated with this project.The story line is actually a little more involved for `Scary Movie 2,' as if you needed a plot to set up the horrendous `laugh scenes,' which are fewer and far between this time. Classic camp actor Tim Curry is Professor Oldman, a college teacher who recruits a group of students to spend the night in a haunted house so he can conduct some sort of experiment (though we never really understand what that experiment is all about). Of course, this group contains most of the kids from the first `Scary Movie,' including innocent Cindy (Anna Faris), loud-mouthed Brenda (Regina Hall), marijuana-obsessed Shorty (Marlon Wayans), and sexually questionable Ray (Shawn Wayans). New this time is straight-arrow Clark (Christopher Masterson).  The house is inhabited by the twisted butler Hanson (Chris Elliot) and even a ghost (`Night Court's' Richard Moll). The kids slowly discover the mysteries and secrets of the house, and make every bodily function, sexually oriented, inappropriate joke along the way.There are those who complain about this style of humor in general, and therefor will not see this movie. However, sometimes it works, such as in the original `Scary Movie,' `American Pie,' and even at the far end of the scale, `There's Something About Mary.' There, the gross out is permissible because there are characters we mildly care about, or there are other types of humor going on as well. However, `Scary Movie 2' is the prime example of where gross out humor can go wrong. Instead of playing up some of the humorous character stereotypes, or mixing in some creative horror movie parodies with the gross-out humor, `Scary Movie 2' relies solely on it. It seems to me that many scenes in the film were robbed of their comic potential so our seven scriptwriters could fit more vomit, feces, and other unmentionable bodily concoctions into the film.There are a few laughs that harked back to `Scary Movie,' and those scenes always feature one of the two Wayans brother's characters. Even though they had five other folks working with them, its clear that this is their project. Maybe those other five scriptwriters fought back and added in the gross-out stuff.As for performances, the same can be said. Both Wayans seem to have more comedic experience than their fellow teen-age counterparts. Faris is better than she was in the first `Scary Movie,' but nowhere near as funny. Plus, she still looks and sounds just a little too odd for me. Curry hasn't had a good role since the mid 80's, and its sad that this is the caliber of film he works in. There are other famous cameos including James Woods as a priest and former Conan O'Brien sidekick Andy Richter as his assistant, but one must wonder what they are doing slumming around in this film. After watching Woods in his worst performance to date, it frightened me to realize that Marlon Brando was originally cast in the role. There would be no saving his career had he gone through with this. If you have any desire to be thoroughly disgusted, or like your humor from the bottom of the barrel (and I mean bottom!) then check out `Scary Movie 2.' Otherwise, go on living your life with the knowledge than unlike myself, you managed to escape this waste of a sequel.

OK, the Exorcist send up in the first 10 minutes was amusing. It also made me think that maybe the reviews about this movie were wrong. The oldies dancing to "shake your ass, watch yourself" was fun to watch, as was Natasha Lyonne's deadpan response to their antics. James Woods is always entertaining to watch in any genre and his performance here didn't disappoint.But what the hell happened after that? Director Keenen Ivory Wayans sense of whats funny from the 1st film seemed to elude him here. The jokes just fell flat and flat after that, the acting was terrible and often stupefying to watch. The rest of the film just felt like a waste of time. And that f****** parrot was really annoying!Scary movie 1 and 3 were both enjoyable, and no. 4 does look promising, but I recommend skipping this one in the series, you'll be glad you did.

Scary Movie 2 is way badder than the first. Scary Movie 1 had laughs every single minute of the movie, but the second one is less funny. The interpretation was still very good, and Keenan Ivory Williams is still able to direct his movie, but let's just say it's not as funny and as organized as the first Scary Movie. Yeah, you get a laugh every once a while, but still, that's not enough to make this movie one of my favourites. It's watchable, but still, as I said many times, Scary Movie 1 is way much better. The Wayans brothers are still pretty good, but I've seen a lot better (and funnier) results from them than from Scary Movie 2.

Honnestly, I don't get how people could like this movie. So you make a parody, okay. That's cool, that's even fun. People buy it, people like it and you earn money.But you don't write a sequel to a parody! This whole idea is wrong on its own, but then they just had to add lame jokes about sex and other vulgarities. You can be funny without that! By example, the Charlie's Angels parody was good. If you saw the real movie afterward, you truly realized how ridiculous it was. But all the other humor was just way over the line. Those are jokes ten year old kids giggle at. By the looks of it, it was some guy with the brains of a ten year old who wrote the script... So, I beg you, next time, think twice before you write a sequel.

Unabashedly hilarious at times and self-aware despite its reliance on grossness, Scary Movie 2 only works as far as you can tolerate it.Scary Movie 2 is a fun time for the most part and i like some of the limits its willing to trespass to achieve these laughs. It feels aware of itself and for a good chunk of the film, it doesn't try to be something that it isn't. The final act of the film balances a lot of adventure and comedy and i felt these sequences betrayed a lot of what the film stood for and wasn't all that exciting or well-done. The grossness depicted as well as the characters depicted feel over-the top and too slimey.

About as funny as having ones testes chewed by a mutant army of rabid goats. Not even so bad it's funny. Gone so far past not funny that it overshot so bad it's funny and instead emerged in the murky and not oft explored world of absolute, unmitigated, unwatchable tripe. Run for your Lives! I was once involved in a minor car accident. It was much more fun than Scary Movie II. Please don't watch this. This plot is non-existent, not really a problem for a well scripted entertaining comedy, but this isn't one. From beginning to thankless end this monstrosity does not contain a single even mildly amusing moment. I laughed more in Brief Encounter. The acting is so bad it hurts, the script was written by diabetic gibbons with Tourettes and the general tone of this crime against humanity is so painfully patronising i was forced to jump up and down on my DVD until it was rendered conclusively unwatchable, avoiding any possible future chance that i might one day trip on a children's toy and accidentally drop the DVD into the player again, forcing me, God forbid, to sit before some of its cringeingly, achingly dull content again. Do anything to avoid ever seeing this abhorration. Take any necessary steps. Murder? Worth it. The only aspect of this movie that has any merit whatsoever is the title, which is fittingly apt. As the epithet suggests, this is indeed a Scary Movie, terrifyingly, spine-chillingly bad. Don't Do It.

A proper laugh riot all the way from beginning to end. Plenty of stuff to miss and catch on a second or third watch. Tim Curry is a delight as always, as is Veronica Cartwright. Even James Woods manages to be watchable.

This movie is totally one that only immature teens will love.  There is nothing really funny in it except the first few exorcist scenes... the rest is mostly garbage.  Obviously don't expect a plot when seeing a movie like this.  It is purely meant to be humourous in a sick and childish way.

I totally understand that this film and all of the scary movie films are pretty terrible films but I just can't help but love them! The comedy in this film is right up my street, it's ridiculous and it makes fun of all the classic horror films that I love. The comedy is just pure crude and I find it absolutely hilarious and will always film it funny. This is a great film to watch with friends and have a good laugh with, it's just contagious once one person if laughing. I will forever think that this movie is the best of the series and I think that is hands down because of the cast, how did they get Tim Curry in this thing? I will never know! Overall though I just love this movie and I don't care what anyone says as this will always be up there for movies to have a laugh to. I love it!

Is there a plot?  Not really.  Do we care?  Not really.  Scary Movie 2 strings the audience along from one gag after another.  There are some big laughs in this film but sometimes it's tedious getting to them.  See this late at night with a full theatre and you're going to have a good time. It's just as raunchy as the first one and just as tasteless.  That's why the first one was so popular.  It's a mouth full of laughs (just ask Tori Spelling).

I have various mixed emotions about this sequel to the hit SCARY MOVIE. It wasn't as good but it delivered many laughs and slap-on-knees. I was a little surprised at this one on how they could spoof any movie right after the other. If you really liked the first one, you could be disappointed or satisfied with this one.

OK, not Oscar material and this was pretty badly made. But again like most brainless comedies, I walked in the theater with a good mood and expecting a laugh and I got that with "Scary Movie 2". I mean people are being so harsh on this film, I understand, I know this isn't the greatest movie or comedy. But if you aren't expecting fun and laughter, I think normally you just feel like bashing the movie then.We have some of the old cast members from the original Scary Movie: Anna Farris, a surprising return of Regina Hall, and Marlon and Shawn Wayne. This Scary Movie took on the films like The Exorcist(hilarious scene by the way), Poltergeist, The Haunting, Mission Impossible, Charlie's Angels, and What lies beneath. With some great add ons like Tim Curry, I just had a great time. Tori Spelling, yeah, she's a bit scary, but for some reason she still gets her equal share of laughs.The Butler just killed me with the hand. Yes, it was gross, but I think you just have to let go and just go with the joke. Scary Movie 2 isn't the best comedy ever, but it's a decent one with your brain turned off. Sick jokes, yes, and very crude one's, this movie isn't for everyone. But I think if you enjoyed the first Scary Movie, you'll enjoy this one too! 7/10

After an opening Exorcist parody (a film that already received a feature-length comic parody; Repossessed), this immediate sequel sinks right back down to the sheer stupidity of the first one. Lured to a secluded mansion for a sleep study, college students Shorty, Cindy, Ray and Brenda (from the first film), plus some others, find themselves trapped inside with evil spirits. It's all an excuse for unimaginative, low brow "comedy" involving semen, vomit, crap and other bodily functions, sex organs, inflated tits, rape, homosexuals, drug addiction and the handicapped. There are (pretty lame) references to The Amityville Horror, House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Poltergeist and The Entity and some surprising ones to Poe's House of Usher and The Black Cat, plus non-horror gags (Rocky, Charlie's Angels, Dude, Where's My Car? etc.) to pad out the running time. Jokes are made about the Clinton/Lewinski scandal, the missing Florida ballots and Firestone tires (things that will instantly date it), plus a marijuana monster and the fighting cat bit is pretty cute. This has a few more laughs than the first film thanks almost entirely to Chris Elliott's inspired comic lunacy as a weird, perverted caretaker with a deformed hand. It took seven people to script this thing. Marlon Brando supposedly turned down 2 million dollars to cameo as a priest and was replaced by James Woods. There's no point to any of this, but as the end rap theme reminds us, "Must be the money."

Although not quite as funny as the original, I still enjoyed Scary Movie 2 very much. While some bits are downright idiotic, some are genuinely hilarious, and will have you rolling in the aisles. If you're not a fan of Scary Movie, you won't like this one either, however. But, if you enjoyed the first, come back to see this one too.

This is the raunchiest of the Scary Movies. If you thought the original was "too much", well, this one will truly give you more reasons to avoid it for it's vulgar content and crude sex jokes. That's for you, easily offended people. I had a great time with it when it first came out in theaters. I really liked the crude sex humor and vulgar spoofs. So for those who are into sex jokes and scatological humor, you will be amused.The opening sequence is truly hilarious and in my opinion, the best part of the movie. It was about time that the "Scary Movie" franchise had an Exorcist spoof! It was great. James Woods in the role of Father Merrin delivers a hysterical performance relying most of his scenes on scatological humor and profanity. For example, when Reagan says "f*** me" and he immediately jumps into her and simulates to be penetrating her. Another example is the line where Reagan's mother says "she won't even let me touch her!" and the priest responds "yeah sometimes that happens, you have to give candy to the children" (or something like that); obviously referring to recent pederastry cases. On the other side, the movie also has "classical" but always effective teen humor . For example, when entering the room for the first time, he gets scared and runs away when Reagan turns her head on 180º; and the always effective vomiting cycle. After the Exorcist spoof, the movie centers on the Poltergeist and Entity spoofs. That's when the movie takes a new direction and does not changes from it. Expect spoofs from popular t.v. commercials, songs (Vitamin C), and even racist and homophobic jokes. The sex jokes worth a watch specially on the infamous clown scene, and the sex ghost. "Scary Movie 2" does not "cross" the line on the vulgar factor. It's just a good rated R movie with spoofs for all tastes; of course, if you are not easily offended. But be sure to watch it on DVD; do not watch the t.v. version because it's very cut (specially on dialogs).This is in my opinion the best of the "Scary Movies".

This movie is great and what I think is an awesome installment. This is a film I watched over and over at one point in my life when I was younger. I love the comedy and the differing cast! I don't like how at times the sketches/scenes can feel stitched together or out of place. This sequel technically makes no sense due to Ray being a villain in the first Scary Movie, but I guess they let bygones be bygones. Over all a great addition!

Comedy is a lot easier to judge than most other forms of cinema, it can easily be measured by how many times you laugh. I suppose drama, could be judged by how much it "gets" to you, a horror on how much it scares you etc. Most of you will know what this film is about and what to expect, parodies of recent films and some very low brow humour, so I won't go into detail giving it a proper review, but I'll just say if that sounds up your street, and it's on the TV one night, check it out. If you aren't likely to find a string of gay, sex, toilet and the like jokes entertaining, then you should avoid. I fell into the latter category and still decided to watch it, and it got a couple of laughs out of me and a few smiles, mainly from the exchanges between the guy in the wheelchair and the guy with the withered hand, the guy with the withered hand in general, the Big Daddy Kane nod, and the high tech devices they used for communicating near the end of the film. There is a nice bit of comic acting in here too, and as with most parody movies, you will also get more out of it if you've seen the films it spoofs.Unless you're a fan of general toilet humour, be aware of what you're getting into.

I might have to do some checking up on this, but I'm pretty sure that seven writers is a record high for a non-anthology film. And just what is this cinematic treat scripted with so many pens? It's probably really good, right? I mean, with seven writers, it would have to be extremely goodor very, very bad. Unfortunately, it is the latter, and the movie is `Scary Movie 2.' This sequel of the funny teen-horror spoof `Scary Movie' has none of the subtleties, parodies, or even big laughs the original film did. Instead, it digresses to overtly sexual and gross-out humor which doesn't even work on a gut level. I feel sorry for every person associated with this project.The story line is actually a little more involved for `Scary Movie 2,' as if you needed a plot to set up the horrendous `laugh scenes,' which are fewer and far between this time. Classic camp actor Tim Curry is Professor Oldman, a college teacher who recruits a group of students to spend the night in a haunted house so he can conduct some sort of experiment (though we never really understand what that experiment is all about). Of course, this group contains most of the kids from the first `Scary Movie,' including innocent Cindy (Anna Faris), loud-mouthed Brenda (Regina Hall), marijuana-obsessed Shorty (Marlon Wayans), and sexually questionable Ray (Shawn Wayans). New this time is straight-arrow Clark (Christopher Masterson).  The house is inhabited by the twisted butler Hanson (Chris Elliot) and even a ghost (`Night Court's' Richard Moll). The kids slowly discover the mysteries and secrets of the house, and make every bodily function, sexually oriented, inappropriate joke along the way.There are those who complain about this style of humor in general, and therefor will not see this movie. However, sometimes it works, such as in the original `Scary Movie,' `American Pie,' and even at the far end of the scale, `There's Something About Mary.' There, the gross out is permissible because there are characters we mildly care about, or there are other types of humor going on as well. However, `Scary Movie 2' is the prime example of where gross out humor can go wrong. Instead of playing up some of the humorous character stereotypes, or mixing in some creative horror movie parodies with the gross-out humor, `Scary Movie 2' relies solely on it. It seems to me that many scenes in the film were robbed of their comic potential so our seven scriptwriters could fit more vomit, feces, and other unmentionable bodily concoctions into the film.There are a few laughs that harked back to `Scary Movie,' and those scenes always feature one of the two Wayans brother's characters. Even though they had five other folks working with them, its clear that this is their project. Maybe those other five scriptwriters fought back and added in the gross-out stuff.As for performances, the same can be said. Both Wayans seem to have more comedic experience than their fellow teen-age counterparts. Faris is better than she was in the first `Scary Movie,' but nowhere near as funny. Plus, she still looks and sounds just a little too odd for me. Curry hasn't had a good role since the mid 80's, and its sad that this is the caliber of film he works in. There are other famous cameos including James Woods as a priest and former Conan O'Brien sidekick Andy Richter as his assistant, but one must wonder what they are doing slumming around in this film. After watching Woods in his worst performance to date, it frightened me to realize that Marlon Brando was originally cast in the role. There would be no saving his career had he gone through with this. If you have any desire to be thoroughly disgusted, or like your humor from the bottom of the barrel (and I mean bottom!) then check out `Scary Movie 2.' Otherwise, go on living your life with the knowledge than unlike myself, you managed to escape this waste of a sequel.

OK, the Exorcist send up in the first 10 minutes was amusing. It also made me think that maybe the reviews about this movie were wrong. The oldies dancing to "shake your ass, watch yourself" was fun to watch, as was Natasha Lyonne's deadpan response to their antics. James Woods is always entertaining to watch in any genre and his performance here didn't disappoint.But what the hell happened after that? Director Keenen Ivory Wayans sense of whats funny from the 1st film seemed to elude him here. The jokes just fell flat and flat after that, the acting was terrible and often stupefying to watch. The rest of the film just felt like a waste of time. And that f****** parrot was really annoying!Scary movie 1 and 3 were both enjoyable, and no. 4 does look promising, but I recommend skipping this one in the series, you'll be glad you did.

Scary Movie 2 is way badder than the first. Scary Movie 1 had laughs every single minute of the movie, but the second one is less funny. The interpretation was still very good, and Keenan Ivory Williams is still able to direct his movie, but let's just say it's not as funny and as organized as the first Scary Movie. Yeah, you get a laugh every once a while, but still, that's not enough to make this movie one of my favourites. It's watchable, but still, as I said many times, Scary Movie 1 is way much better. The Wayans brothers are still pretty good, but I've seen a lot better (and funnier) results from them than from Scary Movie 2.

About as funny as having ones testes chewed by a mutant army of rabid goats. Not even so bad it's funny. Gone so far past not funny that it overshot so bad it's funny and instead emerged in the murky and not oft explored world of absolute, unmitigated, unwatchable tripe. Run for your Lives! I was once involved in a minor car accident. It was much more fun than Scary Movie II. Please don't watch this. This plot is non-existent, not really a problem for a well scripted entertaining comedy, but this isn't one. From beginning to thankless end this monstrosity does not contain a single even mildly amusing moment. I laughed more in Brief Encounter. The acting is so bad it hurts, the script was written by diabetic gibbons with Tourettes and the general tone of this crime against humanity is so painfully patronising i was forced to jump up and down on my DVD until it was rendered conclusively unwatchable, avoiding any possible future chance that i might one day trip on a children's toy and accidentally drop the DVD into the player again, forcing me, God forbid, to sit before some of its cringeingly, achingly dull content again. Do anything to avoid ever seeing this abhorration. Take any necessary steps. Murder? Worth it. The only aspect of this movie that has any merit whatsoever is the title, which is fittingly apt. As the epithet suggests, this is indeed a Scary Movie, terrifyingly, spine-chillingly bad. Don't Do It.

Scary Movie 2 (2001) follows four teens who are tricked into staying at a haunted mansion for a school research project. This film isn't good per say, but it is a lot of fun and definitely one to watch with friends.The humour was ridiculous yet charming, very stereotypically 2000s. It had me laughing out loud from the very start but, there again, I have a broken sense of humour! The references to pop culture really added to the humour and made it funnier in my opinion. However, I wasn't a fan of the gross visual jokes and I found myself unable to watch them.The film didn't have much interesting cinematography and visuals but I don't think it needed it. Plus the set designs were quite good, and there genuinely were some decent colour palettes throughout.The acting was poor but this was definitely intentional, and the characters were strangely loveable in a way. All the acting was over exaggerated and the characters followed stereotypes that mock other horror films. There were some fun and unexpected cameos too, for example I didn't expect Tim Curry to be in it, and found his character very funny.Lastly, the pacing worked well for this type of film as it was fast and witty, never dwelling on one moment for too long. Also, something I really didn't expect was that the story was actually pretty engaging.

This movie is totally one that only immature teens will love.  There is nothing really funny in it except the first few exorcist scenes... the rest is mostly garbage.  Obviously don't expect a plot when seeing a movie like this.  It is purely meant to be humourous in a sick and childish way.

Unabashedly hilarious at times and self-aware despite its reliance on grossness, Scary Movie 2 only works as far as you can tolerate it.Scary Movie 2 is a fun time for the most part and i like some of the limits its willing to trespass to achieve these laughs. It feels aware of itself and for a good chunk of the film, it doesn't try to be something that it isn't. The final act of the film balances a lot of adventure and comedy and i felt these sequences betrayed a lot of what the film stood for and wasn't all that exciting or well-done. The grossness depicted as well as the characters depicted feel over-the top and too slimey.

Honnestly, I don't get how people could like this movie. So you make a parody, okay. That's cool, that's even fun. People buy it, people like it and you earn money.But you don't write a sequel to a parody! This whole idea is wrong on its own, but then they just had to add lame jokes about sex and other vulgarities. You can be funny without that! By example, the Charlie's Angels parody was good. If you saw the real movie afterward, you truly realized how ridiculous it was. But all the other humor was just way over the line. Those are jokes ten year old kids giggle at. By the looks of it, it was some guy with the brains of a ten year old who wrote the script... So, I beg you, next time, think twice before you write a sequel.

A proper laugh riot all the way from beginning to end. Plenty of stuff to miss and catch on a second or third watch. Tim Curry is a delight as always, as is Veronica Cartwright. Even James Woods manages to be watchable.

A group of teens are tricked by their professor into visiting a haunted house for a school project. Now, the house is filled with secrets and ghosts.This film pokes fun of many horror films, including The Exorcist, Poltergeist, The Haunting, and What Lies Beneath. The prologue, like any other Scary Movie films, spoofs The Exorcist. It was funny and gross.The acting is some-what good but a film like this only focuses on the jokes, which is a good thing. This film made me laugh so hard at some scenes and others were tend to be too gross and not funny at all.Unlike David Zucker's Scary movie films, the Wayans push their Scary Movie films to be rated R. Their jokes can go far as they want it. It can be as crude, gross, or sexual as they want it. Some may like their style better than David Zucker's so it just depends on which team you like.This is the worst, not meaning bad, film of the series. Yeah, it gives out some big laughs but it wasn't as funny as the other three films in the franchise. The team are trying too hard to pull for the joke. Fans of the Scary Movie films might be disappointed by this sequel.

Not worth my time to give more than the 4 lines required by IMDB to have my comments registered!  Take away the somewhat funny cursing parakeet, and my rating goes from a 3 to less than zero.  Pure crap; I can't believe this franchise is filming a 3rd installment up in Vancouver as I write.
