What an insane movie. For the most part, in a good way. That being said: there were moments in it, and some aspects, that I found incredibly frustrating... yet there was a lot that did work, and I found it growing on me as the movie went along.I tried watching this about 8 or 9 years ago and couldn't stomach the first fifteen minutes, and so shut it off. I think it was right around the time they started singing Nirvana; I just said 'nope,' not for me.Returning to it now, those first fifteen minutes were still a fairly tough sit. The editing and loudness is just ridiculous. I didn't know whether it was supposed to be funny or cool or what- I was overwhelmed and confused, whilst still recognising that technically it was at least interesting.Things got better slowly- an extended comedic sequence filled with innuendo felt like it was from an Austin Powers movie, and tonally the whole thing felt all over the place. Nothing was given room to breathe, and certain stunning shots would only last a second or so before a jarring cut to something else. There were a few brief moments here and there where I literally couldn't comprehend what was going on.I think the movie did slow down a little in its second hour, or maybe I just grew more used to the style... maybe both? I started to enjoy the music, bold colours, fast-paced musical numbers, and the acting more. The latter is quite good, honestly, especially when it comes to Ewan McGregor, who was excellent. I hated John Leguizamo in this movie though- his character was super irritating, even by Baz Luhrmann standards.And while the final act feels a little drawn out, it's got some stunning moments, and probably the best music in the whole film.Overall, it's exhausting and insane, but for me at least it mostly worked. I can understand people loving this movie. I can understand people hating this movie. And honestly, I can understand anyone being anywhere inbetween on this movie.

Moulin Rouge portrays a complicated, passionate and powerful love story, that is also incredibly moving. I am 17, and I thought the film was near-perfect, I mean I loved the overall look of the film with its gorgeous costumes, dazzling choreography and sumptuous cinematography. The script was very poetic, especially when Christian is comparing Satine, the beautiful courtesan to a "sparkling diamond", and when Toulouse exclaims "I hope the piano is tuned". The songs are wonderful, particularly "Come What May" and "The Show Must Go On", and everybody in the cast does their own singing, and I honestly didn't know Ewen MacGregor could sing, he has an amazing voice. I have heard too many complaints saying there are too many songs, but do bear in mind it is a musical, and to me, being an aspiring singer, music is like poetry, and very often is the best way to describe your mood. I thought the performances were brilliant. Ewen MacGregor is very earnest and likable as always as Christian, and Nicole Kidman is both fabulously sexy and wonderfully tragic as the consumptive Satine, and the character's death scene was quite heart-rending, and was very reminiscent of the Greta Garbo movie Camille(which I will admit I like more). I also liked the performances of Jim Broadbent as the sympathetic Ziegler and Richard Roxburgh as the wily duke. However there were one or two aspects that were extremely silly, like the hilarious Can Can scene as well as the duet between Ziegler and the Duke, and compared to Jose Ferrer's more poignant portrayal as Toulouse in the 1952 version, John Leguizamo as the character mayn't be to everyone's taste. Overall, a beautiful extravagant film with a 9/10. Bethany Cox

I wonder if that line from the Duke "I don't care about your ridiculous dogma" was directed to Lars Von Triar. It could be, the film is full of knowing lines "He could make you a star and you're dallying with the writer!" or "They dressed me with the Argentinean's best clothes and passed me for a famous English writer" There is something of Ken Russell's second period in "Moulin Rouge" Everything is emphasized, underlined and repeated at least three times for safety. Excess seem a rather feeble term to describe it and yet, it works. The film, for the most part, is a delight. Nicole Kidman, ravishing and spectacular, spectacular. Ewan McGregor, superb, and so charismatic that no one would blame me if I confess I had a had crush on him as soon as he broke into "The Hills are alive with the sound of music..." Kidman and McGregor, this film proves it, are the closest thing we've had in years to the big stars of yesteryear. They could make anything shine and they have. Another detail that shouldn't go amiss, "Moulin Rouge" opened the door again for musicals and that's always a good thing even if we're bound to be bombarded by some terrible stuff. I say it doesn't matter as long as it allows glorious film talents of the caliber of Kidman and McGregor to give us the pleasures they have even in a bag of wind such as "Moulin Rouge"

At the risk of sounding overly bombastic, "Moulin Rouge" is the best film I've seen all year, perhaps the best one I've seen in over a year.  It is operatic in the best sense of the word, being at once massively outlandish and deeply personal.  It is clear that a lot of people took career risks in choosing this film, and although "Moulin Rouge" may not rack up a huge box office, I think this film will become a classic alongside his other two films "Strictly Ballroom" and "Romeo + Juliet."In the showing of "Moulin Rouge" I saw last week, at least 5 people walked out.  At the same time I heard audience members audibly gasping at the films visuals and talking back to the screen.  The source of these strong reactions?  Baz Luhrmann's confidence in his garish cinematic vision and the commitment his actors have in him.  The cast fills their roles with relish, even when the entire scene totters on the edge of overkill--but oddly enough, it is the focus that sets "Moulin Rouge" apart from other films these days.  Whereas some actors sleepwalk through their roles as they collect their paychecks, everything about "Moulin Rouge" is done in earnest.This movie is the anti-"Pearl Harbor," because instead of being a hodgepodge of market-tested ideas, "Moulin Rouge" presents a bold vision and dares the audience to accept or reject it.  I, for one, accepted it with delight.  A telling comparison: Luhrmann has Nicole Kidman and Ewen MacGregor sing the film's love song.  Very daring.  For "Pearl Harbor" Michael Bay chose Faith Hill.  Very safe.  Too safe.  Can you imagine Ben Afleck belting out "There You'll Be"?"Moulin Rouge" glitters with such bold decisions.  It is a sumptuous feast for ear and eye featuring gorgeous costumes, intricate sets (Nicole Kidman's boudoir in a gigantic elephant is a case in point), and outlandishly choreographed dance numbers are paraded with frenetic relish.  And the music, the MUSIC!  As you probably know by now, Luhrmann has thrown into his period piece a collage of musical snippets from, among many bits, "The Sound of Music," Madonna, The Police, and Elton John.  In most cases, no one song gets performed without intersplicing.  Witness Luhrmann's audacity: the opening number includes a melding of Labelle's "Lady Marmalade" with Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit."  And here's the spooky part: it works.The entire movie plays this way, and for the most part it works.  Most surpising is that "Moulin Rouge" has a solid, deeply sincere emotional core. Although the film professes to be about love, I'd add that it is equally about loss.  The Moulin Rouge is a playground where adults pretend they are children with the added spice of sensuality.All the performances are excellent, but the hidden gem is Jim Broadbent as Zidler.  Broadbent for years has been doing majestically understated supporting work, from "Brazil" to "Enchanted April" to "Topsy-Turvy."  In "Moulin Rouge" he manages to be both repulsive and endearing.  His spirited rendition of "Like a Virgin" is classic.  Too bad it's not on the soundtrack.Expect to be overwhelmed by "Moulin Rouge" in the most unexpected, delightful ways.  It will make you wonder why other films can't or won't dare to be that bold.

I have seen Moulin Rouge at least 25 times.  I think it is the most extraordinary movie of my generation and breaks every limit set by the industry.  I have heard all the traditional complaints...people didn't like the music, the editing was too swift, or it wasn't "their taste".  Moulin Rouge took a risk.  A risk films like A Beautiful Mind and Shakespeare in Love don't.  It risked by being controversial.  To make a likeable movie isn't hard, follow the Hollywood mold and stick in a few attractive actors, some bland dialogue and viola you have a film.  Moulin Rouge was made knowing that not everyone would like it, but knowing everyone would at least appreciate it for its artistic ingenuity.  Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story.  The editing in the Roxanne scene rushes through your body and is the most incredible of any movie in history.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are the most passionate on-screen couple; entirely convincing as their voices meld them together into one.  Never has a movie done what Moulin Rouge did.  It realized that the world of film is only being represented in one small way, whereas Moulin Rouge uses a camera and screen to make something bigger and more extraordinary than has ever been made before.  It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless.

This was easily one of the best movies I've seen in years. Rarely do movies have a visual force capable of stunning you into rapt silence; and even more rare are films able to further this with a soundtrack that can move you and ensnare you as well, if not better, than the images. Yet some how, through genius, magic, luck, or some combination, Moulin Rouge has managed to do both. In truth Moulin Rouge is a fusion of two fabulous films into one. A film of images capable of conveying meaning without dialog or music, and a film which you could feel and understand with out needing to see it. Much effort was obviously spent on both the visual and audio aspects of this film, and by choosing not to focus on one over the other, and sacrifice the songs for the story or vice versa, the filmmakers were able to make a truly unique, modern musical which those of us who have hated musical since childhood could enjoy. Moulin Rouge is a blend of old, established techniques with innovative experimental ones, resulting in a movie which could only have been made in our time, yet which has a classic feel. The acting is wonderful, the mixture of modern songs is ingenious, and the cinematography is at times simply amazing. The end result is a stunning film with unbelievable performances; a cinematic experience that people will be loving, analyzing and trying to imitate for year.

Satine is a performer in the Notorious Moulin Rouge of 19th Century Paris. She performs on the stage, and for people with enough money, in bed too.But she falls in love with a penniless poet. Ummm...well that is the plot. Oh wait, I forget an evil duke.Baz Luhrmann, the crazy Aussie director, takes this simple plot and proceeds to hit the audience over the head with enough camera cuts, visual style and just plan Bazisms so that you are forced into feeling everything the characters feel in a way no other film maker does.Often I feel that Baz never has enough confidence to trust the audience to take the journey with him, but what what he does, only he does.From the first moment you are dragged into an amazing cinematic world where you should turn your brain off. This is not because the movie is stupid but because Baz and his film making team are going to do the thinking and feeling for you.Unique and amazing this movie uses things we are familiar with to transport us into a world that we don't really understand. A world where the can can is a notorious dance (actually women wore split crotch panties when they did this dance) and the electric light bulb was a modern wonder (people went to Moulin Rouge just to see this technological marvel...or so they told their wives).

I have now seen Moulin Rouge more times than I should say and I have noticed something new and unique every time.  This film is so intricate (and beautiful) that you cannot possibly absorb it all in one  viewing.  Luhrman (along with his Bazmark production team) really is a visionary and his films push the limits in such amazing ways.  The music, the sets, the choreography - all of it is awe-inspiring.  Ewan McGregor proves his versatility as an actor yet again by bringing such a heartfelt innocence to Christian - and  the man can sing!  Nicole Kidman went from being just another actress to me to one of my favorites - she takes on the role of Satine so honestly and proves that she not only has a comedic side but a great voice as well.  Together the two of them light up the screen.  In a year of mostly mediocre films (with a few notable exceptions) Moulin Rouge is totally refreshing.  It not only promotes truth, beauty, freedom, and love but is a perfect example of them as well.  Luhrman himself said that it was time for a new kind of storytelling and he was right!  Open your mind and enjoy one of the most original movie experiences in years.  A bohemian storm is brewing!

The Hindi song featured in the Indian musical within a musical at the end is Chama Chama from the Bollywood movie China Gate. Chama Chama is a show stopping song and dance number.The second song was of course the Marily Monroe classic Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.This should be a trivia AND a movie connection, but I could not place it there, so I am putting it under comments.Maybe IMDb could put a user submission trivia link, even links in other features for the movies.It is also difficult to correct more than one misspelled word per submission.

This is a story about life.  And about the artists who congregated in Paris in 1900, living a bohemian lifestyle and giving the world the fruits of their labor, of their art, for which they would gladly bleed and die.  But mostly this is a story about love.  Of a young man named Christian, a penniless writer, and a singer named Satine, who for a moment came together and tasted the nectar of the gods.  `Moulin Rouge,' written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, takes you into a world that is bright and brilliant, fast and flashy and filled with all of the things that make life worth living.  It's a fantasy world of song and color, of soaring hearts and aspirations-- but also of the reality upon which the illusion of it all is built.  And the effects of that reality on Christian and Satine, whose love has been forbidden by that same reality they seek to dispel by impaling it with the artistic endeavors that give them life.If Disney had commissioned a film to be written by Shakespeare, directed by Fellini and produced by Spielberg, this would be it.  It's a dizzying, whirling burst of lights, colors, music, drama and comedy that assails the senses and will hold you spellbound from beginning to end.  Like the bohemians he portrays, Luhrmann leaves convention behind and dips instead into his own inspired and highly imaginative formula to tell his story. The cinematography (by Donald McAlpine) and art direction (by Ann-Marie Beauchamp and Ian Gracie) are brilliant, as well as the production design (by Catherine Martin) and the sets (by Brigitte Broch).  One of the many inspired touches Luhrmann employs here, is the use of different film speeds throughout, which, when combined with the superlative, quick-cut editing (by Jill Bilcock), makes it all transporting and surreal.
Ewan McGregor turns is a terrific performance as Christian, the young man who arrives in Paris with nothing more than spirit and a head filled with ideas and ideals.  When artistic differences leaves Zidler (Jim Broadbent), proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, without a writer for a new show, `Spectacular, Spectacular,' Christian steps in.  And so does McGregor, who shines in the part.  And the boy can sing!  He may not have the greatest voice in the world, but it's a good `stage voice,' and most importantly, he can sell a song, as evidenced by the scene in which he puts across Elton John's `Your Song.'  McGregor has a charismatic screen presence, and in this role he really gets a chance to demonstrate his versatility as an actor.As Satine, Nicole Kidman is saucy and sensuous, bringing her character vividly to life, this woman who makes her living by being every man's fantasy as she sings and sashays her way through this world of the Moulin Rouge.  In her heart, she longs to be a serious actress, and if this new show is a success, she just may get her chance.  But first, the show needs someone to finance the lavish production.  They may have one-- the Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh), has expressed interest, but he has one condition.  If he pays for the show he wants something in return (besides a profit on his investment).  He wants Satine.  But so does Christian, who has nothing to offer the show but his talent, and nothing for Satine but his love.  Zidler, meanwhile, aware of the Duke's demands, urges Satine to turn her back on Christian, to `save him.'  And beyond and besides all that is happening, there is something else going on with Satine, something more personal, that ultimately will have an effect on the outcome of the dilemma for all concerned.The supporting cast includes John Leguizamo (Toulouse Lautrec), Kylie Minogue (The Green Fairy), Garry McDonald (Doctor), Jacek Koman (The Narcoleptic Argentinean), Matthew Whittet (Satie), Kerry Walker (Marie) and Laszlo Lukas (Conductor).  With an eye for detail and his imagination thrust into overdrive, Luhrmann has put together and delivered one of the brightest films to come along in quite awhile.  `Moulin Rouge' is an explosion of sights and sounds, a film laced with humor and visual largess that holds a poignant and dramatic story at it's heart.  Entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable, this is a memorable film and a satisfying movie-going experience. It's a story about love; a story told through the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

I think the 'Moulin rouge'is the most romantic film I have ever seen! I sat crying on the couch watching the movie. Nicole Kidman (Satine) acts if it's real. I was shocked when she died. I just couldn't believe it. Yes, I was crying and my boyfriend too. It was so a romantic film, it's just like 'Romeo and Juliet', just as beautiful.I hope there will come another movie just as exiting as this one because it's a beautiful story and then the music!The music, it is just the thing that makes the film and the story one! I can't describe it. It's amazing!You just have to see it!!!

This movie blew my mind. Watch it, then watch it again. 'Moulin Rouge' made me laugh, cry, and dream. It's boldness and confidence to produce something so original and different impressed me. At times the scenery was as surreal as something you would experience in a dream, which only makes this movie more amazing. 'Moulin Rouge' shows love from all angles. It includes the raw passion, infatuation, vehemence, intensity, ecstasy, jealousy, and pain that is found in true love. The acting was staggering. Ewan McGregor is unrealistically perfect, combining sweet innocence with masculinity. Kidman perfectly brings out the seductive side of Satine, yet never loses the vulnerable soul that lies behind it. Roxburgh(The Duke) and Leguizamo(Lautrec) bring out just the right amount of comic relief in this intense drama. There is nothing I would change about this movie. One warning, though: Moulin Rouge is not for the artistically deprived. It is quite a contemporary movie, so you may not like it if you prefer to watch simple movies(ex. 'American Pie', 'Scary Movie').

The bad commercial campaigns of the best movie of all time failed to give Moulin Rouge! worldwide recognition, but alas, this happens with many great movies (e.g. Requiem For A Dream, Donnie Darko). The whole comparison between this and the new musical blockbuster Chicago is useless since they are both great movies but not the same. Still, Moulin Rouge! remains in the first place on the Best Movies list. This musical, comical, dramatical and action packed hell of a movie will satisfy the whole audience. It just needs to be given a chance. Never have I seen an audience stand up and clap, with tears in their eyes, at the magnificent movie they have watched.
   The story is very simple but very complicated at the same time, giving enough music, action and laughs for everybody's taste. The characters are very easy to relate to and the edge-of-your-seat directing gives edge to this masterpiece. Christian, a young writer arrives in Paris, against the will of his father, to seek a career as a writer. He meets a group of bohemians who are planning to set up a musical play at the famous club Moulin Rouge and they invite him to rewrite the story of their play but at the same time to lure the famous courtesan Satine as to star in their play. Satine confuses Christian with the Duke, who on the contrary is expected to sleep with Satine to finance the upcoming play. The confusion continues and finally Satine and Christian convince the Duke to accept to finance the play. As the play is made, Christian and Satine fall in love, but the Duke's rights to the play also count for the body of Satine. She is his. And so the lovers try to keep their love a secret before everything is lost. On the way, jealousy, betrayal and trust is needed for their love to be contained.
   Satine is portrayed by the beautiful Nicole Kidman who delivers an astonishing performance. Her character has so much life inside her which makes you fall in love with her. Nicole was truly the one for Satine, for her beauty and character match like no other. She did, in fact, break two ribs during the making of Moulin Rouge! Ewan McGregor, one of the finest young actors on the Hollywood A-List, plays the writer Christian with success. Christian is a three-dimensional character with feelings and compassion. Both of these excellent actors' singing and dancing skills help in the portrayal of their characters.    The direction is simply amazing. With the best director there is, what can someone expect? Baz Luhrmann shows us his creative and brilliant ideas through his direction, cinematography, editing and camera work. All of these factors give you a dazzling effect. The editing gives you enough to be kept at the edge of your seat and also to feel those small goosebumps running up and down your back. The music is absolutely fantastic. The idea of mixing old songs together and forming this huge masterpiece is just amazing. The original music created by Craig Armstrong, one of the finest, also has atmosphere and is truly brilliant.    Mr. Luhrmann also takes us comprehend the importance of the visual world of movies with Moulin Rouge! The whole movie is a visual attack, giving you enough colours to come back begging for more. It dazzles you amazingly and twists you around. The costumes are excellent and the sets are simply fantastic. The mixture of all of these given to you by the editing will leave you speechless and coming back to watch it over and over again.
   Moulin Rouge! is a movie for the people. It has something everyone can relate to. It has been an instant classic ever since it came out in the cinemas. The more you watch Moulin Rouge!, the more you get addicted to it and the songs can even make you sing along. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor show off their acting and singing capabilities and at the same time director Baz Luhrmann mixes them together and forms his finest masterpiece up to date. Moulin Rouge! makes you proud for who you are and will make you fall in love with it. This is a movie about Truth, Beauty, Freedom and above all thing, Love...Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 10/10 - A True Masterpiece

If you're in love, this is the ultimate film for you. This is an emotional ride, not the kind you should watch with frowned foreheads trying to analyse it; but the kind you should watch with a light heart and an open mind. The whole film feels exactly like how the world looks when you're in love - everything's so dream-like, fabulous, spectacular, emotional.It's just utterly entertaining! It's touching at one time, funny at another....Firstly, the music is GREAT - there are the likes of David Bowie, Rufus Wainwright, Beck, Alka Yagnik... even just listening to the soundtrack CD alone is an ultimate emotional ride enough. Visually, the cinematography, costumes, sets, and choreography are just stunning. They work great as a whole and resulting in a dramatic eye candy. The plot, although simple, WORKS.So sit back, dim your lights, unplug your phones - and get ready for a fantastical, romantic 'dream' that is Moulin Rouge.

Favourable reaction to this movie is a good example of a common problem - audiences rewarding something because it's different, regardless of whether it's actually good.Luhrman has good intentions, but he sabotages his own movies by overloading the viewer's senses.The idea to make a period musical where the actors sing contemporary pop songs has great potential, but the storyline is incredibly simplistic, and Luhrmann seems completely incapable of dealing in genuine human emotions, which makes for a hollow movie-going experience.Still, there are a few inspired moments (the movie's high point is the 'Roxanne' number near the end, one of the only times the movie has any emotional power).

*Moulin SPOILERS!* Paris, France, 1900; young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) begins to write the story of his and Moulin Rouge's late star Satine (Nicole Kidman), nicknamed 'The Sparkling Diamond', both a showgirl and a courtesan in France's most famous nightclub-slash-bordello,'s love, which began almost by mistake and grew despite the presence of a big enemy, the childish and scary Duke (Richard Roxburgh), while rehearsing for the big production 'Spectacular, Spectacular' which was supposed to make a real actress out of Satine...Anyone who has seen this movie can attest that it's exuberant, exciting, not afraid of appearing ridiculous, going at a breakneck speed, brightly colored, exceptionally able to switch from comedy to tragedy, that the songs are exceptionally well chosen (even though I'd have liked to see that famous 'Father And Son' scene on the screen - the song is one of my favorites) and that the actors can sing - especially Nicole, Richard (even though he didn't get to sing a lot - only a few verses from 'Like A Virgin') and Ewan.One thing's for sure; this movie's not for everybody. But the people this movie is for will surely be able to appreciate it fully.Moulin Rouge!: 9/10.

Christian (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with Santine (Nicole Kidman) at the Moulin Rouge. She loves him too, but she's promised to the evil Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh). What will she do? Who cares? The film looks incredible but has quite a few major problems...virtually the whole movie is shot in extreme quick cuts making it difficult to know what's going on; the film veers wildly from comedy to satire to tragedy without ever finding a comfortable medium between them; it's too long; all the "songs" are just snatches of popular songs from the past--it's not cute or clever, just annoying (and confusing); Kidman (a very good actress) gives a very bad performance and that's no depth in any of the characters so it's really hard to give a damn. Also John Leguiziamo gives one of his worst performances (and that's saying something). The movie has just two pluses--the truly stunning visuals and McGregor gives out a very good performance--and what a beautiful singing voice! He ALMOST saves the movie. Not recommended.

Can you say "technicolor vomit?"  The idea for this film actually has a lot of potential:  Take a mish-mash of modern pop songs and blend them together in a creative way to create a romantic musical.  But what do we get here? An annoying nightmare of sound and sight that almost drove me from the theater.  This film is more chopped up than the vegetables in a Beni Hanna stir fry.  Luhrmann never focuses on one scene for more than a few seconds and when he does, the computer enhanced colors make the screen incredibly difficult to look at.  The music has moments of creativity, as when "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is blended together with "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend", but all of the scenes come across as little more than videos, not pieces creating a coherent whole.  With respect to the choice of songs: Gosh, can you get more random, Boz Luhrmann?  I mean, I actually feel like Luhrman put a couple hundred song titles in a hat and just chose them at random.  Very strange.  And I enjoyed Ewen McGregor's singing for about an hour (I found myself singing "Your Song" with him at the beginning of the film), but then it started to get annoying.  And Nicole Kidman...what can one say except, "Yuck."  Ever since I saw her in that Battman movie, she just bugs, bugs, bugs.  And I was listening to a PJ Harvey tape in my car on the way home from the theater thinking that Harvey would have been a great choice for the part of Seline.  But she probably wouldn't have been interested in such an artless film.  Finally, why o why does every big budget movie that is set in France have people speaking with British accents?  Is this some kind of unconscious Hollywood rule?  Or couldn't Luhrmann find anyone with French accents to play in this film?  Man, the French must have torn this thing up at Cannes.  "I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that put down in words how terrible this film is while it's in this world."

What an insane movie. For the most part, in a good way. That being said: there were moments in it, and some aspects, that I found incredibly frustrating... yet there was a lot that did work, and I found it growing on me as the movie went along.I tried watching this about 8 or 9 years ago and couldn't stomach the first fifteen minutes, and so shut it off. I think it was right around the time they started singing Nirvana; I just said 'nope,' not for me.Returning to it now, those first fifteen minutes were still a fairly tough sit. The editing and loudness is just ridiculous. I didn't know whether it was supposed to be funny or cool or what- I was overwhelmed and confused, whilst still recognising that technically it was at least interesting.Things got better slowly- an extended comedic sequence filled with innuendo felt like it was from an Austin Powers movie, and tonally the whole thing felt all over the place. Nothing was given room to breathe, and certain stunning shots would only last a second or so before a jarring cut to something else. There were a few brief moments here and there where I literally couldn't comprehend what was going on.I think the movie did slow down a little in its second hour, or maybe I just grew more used to the style... maybe both? I started to enjoy the music, bold colours, fast-paced musical numbers, and the acting more. The latter is quite good, honestly, especially when it comes to Ewan McGregor, who was excellent. I hated John Leguizamo in this movie though- his character was super irritating, even by Baz Luhrmann standards.And while the final act feels a little drawn out, it's got some stunning moments, and probably the best music in the whole film.Overall, it's exhausting and insane, but for me at least it mostly worked. I can understand people loving this movie. I can understand people hating this movie. And honestly, I can understand anyone being anywhere inbetween on this movie.

Moulin Rouge portrays a complicated, passionate and powerful love story, that is also incredibly moving. I am 17, and I thought the film was near-perfect, I mean I loved the overall look of the film with its gorgeous costumes, dazzling choreography and sumptuous cinematography. The script was very poetic, especially when Christian is comparing Satine, the beautiful courtesan to a "sparkling diamond", and when Toulouse exclaims "I hope the piano is tuned". The songs are wonderful, particularly "Come What May" and "The Show Must Go On", and everybody in the cast does their own singing, and I honestly didn't know Ewen MacGregor could sing, he has an amazing voice. I have heard too many complaints saying there are too many songs, but do bear in mind it is a musical, and to me, being an aspiring singer, music is like poetry, and very often is the best way to describe your mood. I thought the performances were brilliant. Ewen MacGregor is very earnest and likable as always as Christian, and Nicole Kidman is both fabulously sexy and wonderfully tragic as the consumptive Satine, and the character's death scene was quite heart-rending, and was very reminiscent of the Greta Garbo movie Camille(which I will admit I like more). I also liked the performances of Jim Broadbent as the sympathetic Ziegler and Richard Roxburgh as the wily duke. However there were one or two aspects that were extremely silly, like the hilarious Can Can scene as well as the duet between Ziegler and the Duke, and compared to Jose Ferrer's more poignant portrayal as Toulouse in the 1952 version, John Leguizamo as the character mayn't be to everyone's taste. Overall, a beautiful extravagant film with a 9/10. Bethany Cox

I wonder if that line from the Duke "I don't care about your ridiculous dogma" was directed to Lars Von Triar. It could be, the film is full of knowing lines "He could make you a star and you're dallying with the writer!" or "They dressed me with the Argentinean's best clothes and passed me for a famous English writer" There is something of Ken Russell's second period in "Moulin Rouge" Everything is emphasized, underlined and repeated at least three times for safety. Excess seem a rather feeble term to describe it and yet, it works. The film, for the most part, is a delight. Nicole Kidman, ravishing and spectacular, spectacular. Ewan McGregor, superb, and so charismatic that no one would blame me if I confess I had a had crush on him as soon as he broke into "The Hills are alive with the sound of music..." Kidman and McGregor, this film proves it, are the closest thing we've had in years to the big stars of yesteryear. They could make anything shine and they have. Another detail that shouldn't go amiss, "Moulin Rouge" opened the door again for musicals and that's always a good thing even if we're bound to be bombarded by some terrible stuff. I say it doesn't matter as long as it allows glorious film talents of the caliber of Kidman and McGregor to give us the pleasures they have even in a bag of wind such as "Moulin Rouge"

At the risk of sounding overly bombastic, "Moulin Rouge" is the best film I've seen all year, perhaps the best one I've seen in over a year.  It is operatic in the best sense of the word, being at once massively outlandish and deeply personal.  It is clear that a lot of people took career risks in choosing this film, and although "Moulin Rouge" may not rack up a huge box office, I think this film will become a classic alongside his other two films "Strictly Ballroom" and "Romeo + Juliet."In the showing of "Moulin Rouge" I saw last week, at least 5 people walked out.  At the same time I heard audience members audibly gasping at the films visuals and talking back to the screen.  The source of these strong reactions?  Baz Luhrmann's confidence in his garish cinematic vision and the commitment his actors have in him.  The cast fills their roles with relish, even when the entire scene totters on the edge of overkill--but oddly enough, it is the focus that sets "Moulin Rouge" apart from other films these days.  Whereas some actors sleepwalk through their roles as they collect their paychecks, everything about "Moulin Rouge" is done in earnest.This movie is the anti-"Pearl Harbor," because instead of being a hodgepodge of market-tested ideas, "Moulin Rouge" presents a bold vision and dares the audience to accept or reject it.  I, for one, accepted it with delight.  A telling comparison: Luhrmann has Nicole Kidman and Ewen MacGregor sing the film's love song.  Very daring.  For "Pearl Harbor" Michael Bay chose Faith Hill.  Very safe.  Too safe.  Can you imagine Ben Afleck belting out "There You'll Be"?"Moulin Rouge" glitters with such bold decisions.  It is a sumptuous feast for ear and eye featuring gorgeous costumes, intricate sets (Nicole Kidman's boudoir in a gigantic elephant is a case in point), and outlandishly choreographed dance numbers are paraded with frenetic relish.  And the music, the MUSIC!  As you probably know by now, Luhrmann has thrown into his period piece a collage of musical snippets from, among many bits, "The Sound of Music," Madonna, The Police, and Elton John.  In most cases, no one song gets performed without intersplicing.  Witness Luhrmann's audacity: the opening number includes a melding of Labelle's "Lady Marmalade" with Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit."  And here's the spooky part: it works.The entire movie plays this way, and for the most part it works.  Most surpising is that "Moulin Rouge" has a solid, deeply sincere emotional core. Although the film professes to be about love, I'd add that it is equally about loss.  The Moulin Rouge is a playground where adults pretend they are children with the added spice of sensuality.All the performances are excellent, but the hidden gem is Jim Broadbent as Zidler.  Broadbent for years has been doing majestically understated supporting work, from "Brazil" to "Enchanted April" to "Topsy-Turvy."  In "Moulin Rouge" he manages to be both repulsive and endearing.  His spirited rendition of "Like a Virgin" is classic.  Too bad it's not on the soundtrack.Expect to be overwhelmed by "Moulin Rouge" in the most unexpected, delightful ways.  It will make you wonder why other films can't or won't dare to be that bold.

I have seen Moulin Rouge at least 25 times.  I think it is the most extraordinary movie of my generation and breaks every limit set by the industry.  I have heard all the traditional complaints...people didn't like the music, the editing was too swift, or it wasn't "their taste".  Moulin Rouge took a risk.  A risk films like A Beautiful Mind and Shakespeare in Love don't.  It risked by being controversial.  To make a likeable movie isn't hard, follow the Hollywood mold and stick in a few attractive actors, some bland dialogue and viola you have a film.  Moulin Rouge was made knowing that not everyone would like it, but knowing everyone would at least appreciate it for its artistic ingenuity.  Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story.  The editing in the Roxanne scene rushes through your body and is the most incredible of any movie in history.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are the most passionate on-screen couple; entirely convincing as their voices meld them together into one.  Never has a movie done what Moulin Rouge did.  It realized that the world of film is only being represented in one small way, whereas Moulin Rouge uses a camera and screen to make something bigger and more extraordinary than has ever been made before.  It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless.

I have not ever felt for a movie the way I do about "Moulin Rouge."  It is not just a movie...it is a cinematic experience the likes of which I have never before seen. The story, the music, the acting, the visual imagery strikes emotion in me I never before thought possible from a film. It is without a doubt the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I have ever seen. It is dizzy, maddening, beautiful, and heartbreaking!  The music is rapturous, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices compliment each other and the story perfectly.  This movie takes its story to a mythic level and surrounds these two star-crossed lovers with music and imagery that simply will take your breath away.  The story is grand, huge, and operatic, as is the music. The brilliant score skillfully weaves many modern, popular songs, and rescores them as the libretto to this grand opera. There are some images in this film unlike anything you have ever seen. And the performances are absolutely incredible, particularly Nicole Kidman's.  I truly felt for these two people, and truly felt that they were in love.  My heart broke into a million pieces for them every time I saw this movie, and I've seen it 8 times. It's an absolutely breathtaking, visionary, masterpiece that did not get the credit it deserved by American critics, who seem to complain that every movie is the same. Yet when an original, daring, shocking film like this comes along, they don't know what to do with it. But then again, this really is not just a film. No mere film could strike me the way this one has, in a way that reaches to the very fibres of my being in a way only "The Wizard of Oz" ever has before. Yes, the story is sad, but what  a journey it takes you on! A journey I will be sure to repeat over and over and over again.

MOULIN ROUGE! / (2001) **** (out of four)By Blake French:	"Moulin Rouge!" revives our imagination and relives the musical era of Hollywood. The film is like an extravagant, expensive Broadway production on screen, with enough open courage, engrossing passion, and zesty energy for several motion pictures. It's one of the year's best films; "Moulin Rouge!" may be a cliché-ridden love triangle, but Baz Luhrmann, the film's director, shines a fresh, stunning originality on a familiar plot. He creates a candid, exuberant style for his characters-a mixture between a fast-paced music video and lush, exotic images. He uses a vast variety of camera placements and shooting angles. In several of the songs, he cuts on nearly every word. This does indeed make us dizzy, but it is the perfect approach to the material. 	From the opening moments, "Moulin Rouge!" plays full force, overpowering our senses. The film doesn't even wait for its opening credits to begin. The usual 20th Century Fox logo appears on the screen within a screen as a little bald musician rises from the bottom, and continues to frantically conduct the traditional Fox fanfare. From this, we cut to "The Sound of Music," where young writer morns over the loss of his true love. The film includes an interesting use of the bookend structure, and I like how it reveals the information about the main character's deadly disease early. This is the kind of movie that does not need to astonish us with sudden plot twists or unexpected character revelations. The joy of watching "Moulin Rouge!" is in the visual stimulation; the plot is more interested in its own character's discoveries than playing mind games with the audience.
	Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they can really sing. Most of the time, celebrity singers turn to the silver screen with a lot of star power but little acting ability. Look at LL Cool J, Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, and I just know Brittany Spears is going to turn up in a movie one of these days. "Moulin Rouge" may be one of the first movies to open musical doors for its leading performers. Even Jim Broadbent proves to be well cast in a crazy, intensified character that he really sinks his teeth into. I will never look at any of these stars in the same light again, even, to my great reluctance, John Leguizamo.The film takes place in the early 19th century, as Christian (McGregor) enters Paris hoping to write love stories. Several peculiar figures live above him, including the French artist Toulouse-Lautrec (Leguizamo) and his Bohemian troupe attempting to construct a play. After a freak accident, Christian is suddenly thrust into the middle of their play. The crew hires him as the star writer. He then takes a visit to the flirtatious Moulin Rouge night club, ran by the robust Harold Zinder (Jim Broadbent). It is here where he tries to persuade the club's popular, sexy lead performer and courtesan, Satine (Kidman), to work in their production.
	After mistaking Christian for a rich and powerful aristocrat, The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), Satine falls in love with Christian, much to the dismay of many. However, she believes herself to be a simple prostitute, who should never fall in love because it will get in the way of success. When the Duke agrees to produce a major production at the Moulin Rogue, but only under his circumstances, things become even more complicated. The Duke demands that Satine becomes his personal property if Harold and the others want his financial support. Obviously, the best thing in "Moulin Rouge!" is the music. Apart from the cast, the film's big list of musical artists includes David Bowe, Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink, Fatboy Slim, Beck, and many others. The kind of music that plays here does not account for a period epic at all, however. "Moulin Rouge!" doesn't try to be a historic depiction, but instead an expression of fantasy and passion. The elegant sets, eventful style, and powerful choreography scream modern day, post-pop-culture. I ran out to purchase the motion picture soundtrack. You should, too. But listening to the soundtrack on your CD player at home is nothing like experiencing the memorable singing and dancing, sexual energy, and relentless enthusiasm on the big screen.
As I say in very few film critiques, some movies are you watch, others you experience. "Moulin Rouge" is an experience not to be missed. It is a bizarre, unique blend of exhaustive energy and lively action-one of the bravest, most ambitious and entertaining movies of the year.

This was easily one of the best movies I've seen in years. Rarely do movies have a visual force capable of stunning you into rapt silence; and even more rare are films able to further this with a soundtrack that can move you and ensnare you as well, if not better, than the images. Yet some how, through genius, magic, luck, or some combination, Moulin Rouge has managed to do both. In truth Moulin Rouge is a fusion of two fabulous films into one. A film of images capable of conveying meaning without dialog or music, and a film which you could feel and understand with out needing to see it. Much effort was obviously spent on both the visual and audio aspects of this film, and by choosing not to focus on one over the other, and sacrifice the songs for the story or vice versa, the filmmakers were able to make a truly unique, modern musical which those of us who have hated musical since childhood could enjoy. Moulin Rouge is a blend of old, established techniques with innovative experimental ones, resulting in a movie which could only have been made in our time, yet which has a classic feel. The acting is wonderful, the mixture of modern songs is ingenious, and the cinematography is at times simply amazing. The end result is a stunning film with unbelievable performances; a cinematic experience that people will be loving, analyzing and trying to imitate for year.

Satine is a performer in the Notorious Moulin Rouge of 19th Century Paris. She performs on the stage, and for people with enough money, in bed too.But she falls in love with a penniless poet. Ummm...well that is the plot. Oh wait, I forget an evil duke.Baz Luhrmann, the crazy Aussie director, takes this simple plot and proceeds to hit the audience over the head with enough camera cuts, visual style and just plan Bazisms so that you are forced into feeling everything the characters feel in a way no other film maker does.Often I feel that Baz never has enough confidence to trust the audience to take the journey with him, but what what he does, only he does.From the first moment you are dragged into an amazing cinematic world where you should turn your brain off. This is not because the movie is stupid but because Baz and his film making team are going to do the thinking and feeling for you.Unique and amazing this movie uses things we are familiar with to transport us into a world that we don't really understand. A world where the can can is a notorious dance (actually women wore split crotch panties when they did this dance) and the electric light bulb was a modern wonder (people went to Moulin Rouge just to see this technological marvel...or so they told their wives).

I have now seen Moulin Rouge more times than I should say and I have noticed something new and unique every time.  This film is so intricate (and beautiful) that you cannot possibly absorb it all in one  viewing.  Luhrman (along with his Bazmark production team) really is a visionary and his films push the limits in such amazing ways.  The music, the sets, the choreography - all of it is awe-inspiring.  Ewan McGregor proves his versatility as an actor yet again by bringing such a heartfelt innocence to Christian - and  the man can sing!  Nicole Kidman went from being just another actress to me to one of my favorites - she takes on the role of Satine so honestly and proves that she not only has a comedic side but a great voice as well.  Together the two of them light up the screen.  In a year of mostly mediocre films (with a few notable exceptions) Moulin Rouge is totally refreshing.  It not only promotes truth, beauty, freedom, and love but is a perfect example of them as well.  Luhrman himself said that it was time for a new kind of storytelling and he was right!  Open your mind and enjoy one of the most original movie experiences in years.  A bohemian storm is brewing!

The Hindi song featured in the Indian musical within a musical at the end is Chama Chama from the Bollywood movie China Gate. Chama Chama is a show stopping song and dance number.The second song was of course the Marily Monroe classic Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.This should be a trivia AND a movie connection, but I could not place it there, so I am putting it under comments.Maybe IMDb could put a user submission trivia link, even links in other features for the movies.It is also difficult to correct more than one misspelled word per submission.

This is a story about life.  And about the artists who congregated in Paris in 1900, living a bohemian lifestyle and giving the world the fruits of their labor, of their art, for which they would gladly bleed and die.  But mostly this is a story about love.  Of a young man named Christian, a penniless writer, and a singer named Satine, who for a moment came together and tasted the nectar of the gods.  `Moulin Rouge,' written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, takes you into a world that is bright and brilliant, fast and flashy and filled with all of the things that make life worth living.  It's a fantasy world of song and color, of soaring hearts and aspirations-- but also of the reality upon which the illusion of it all is built.  And the effects of that reality on Christian and Satine, whose love has been forbidden by that same reality they seek to dispel by impaling it with the artistic endeavors that give them life.If Disney had commissioned a film to be written by Shakespeare, directed by Fellini and produced by Spielberg, this would be it.  It's a dizzying, whirling burst of lights, colors, music, drama and comedy that assails the senses and will hold you spellbound from beginning to end.  Like the bohemians he portrays, Luhrmann leaves convention behind and dips instead into his own inspired and highly imaginative formula to tell his story. The cinematography (by Donald McAlpine) and art direction (by Ann-Marie Beauchamp and Ian Gracie) are brilliant, as well as the production design (by Catherine Martin) and the sets (by Brigitte Broch).  One of the many inspired touches Luhrmann employs here, is the use of different film speeds throughout, which, when combined with the superlative, quick-cut editing (by Jill Bilcock), makes it all transporting and surreal.
Ewan McGregor turns is a terrific performance as Christian, the young man who arrives in Paris with nothing more than spirit and a head filled with ideas and ideals.  When artistic differences leaves Zidler (Jim Broadbent), proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, without a writer for a new show, `Spectacular, Spectacular,' Christian steps in.  And so does McGregor, who shines in the part.  And the boy can sing!  He may not have the greatest voice in the world, but it's a good `stage voice,' and most importantly, he can sell a song, as evidenced by the scene in which he puts across Elton John's `Your Song.'  McGregor has a charismatic screen presence, and in this role he really gets a chance to demonstrate his versatility as an actor.As Satine, Nicole Kidman is saucy and sensuous, bringing her character vividly to life, this woman who makes her living by being every man's fantasy as she sings and sashays her way through this world of the Moulin Rouge.  In her heart, she longs to be a serious actress, and if this new show is a success, she just may get her chance.  But first, the show needs someone to finance the lavish production.  They may have one-- the Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh), has expressed interest, but he has one condition.  If he pays for the show he wants something in return (besides a profit on his investment).  He wants Satine.  But so does Christian, who has nothing to offer the show but his talent, and nothing for Satine but his love.  Zidler, meanwhile, aware of the Duke's demands, urges Satine to turn her back on Christian, to `save him.'  And beyond and besides all that is happening, there is something else going on with Satine, something more personal, that ultimately will have an effect on the outcome of the dilemma for all concerned.The supporting cast includes John Leguizamo (Toulouse Lautrec), Kylie Minogue (The Green Fairy), Garry McDonald (Doctor), Jacek Koman (The Narcoleptic Argentinean), Matthew Whittet (Satie), Kerry Walker (Marie) and Laszlo Lukas (Conductor).  With an eye for detail and his imagination thrust into overdrive, Luhrmann has put together and delivered one of the brightest films to come along in quite awhile.  `Moulin Rouge' is an explosion of sights and sounds, a film laced with humor and visual largess that holds a poignant and dramatic story at it's heart.  Entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable, this is a memorable film and a satisfying movie-going experience. It's a story about love; a story told through the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

I think the 'Moulin rouge'is the most romantic film I have ever seen! I sat crying on the couch watching the movie. Nicole Kidman (Satine) acts if it's real. I was shocked when she died. I just couldn't believe it. Yes, I was crying and my boyfriend too. It was so a romantic film, it's just like 'Romeo and Juliet', just as beautiful.I hope there will come another movie just as exiting as this one because it's a beautiful story and then the music!The music, it is just the thing that makes the film and the story one! I can't describe it. It's amazing!You just have to see it!!!

I have read so many posts on this message board concerning the adoration and delight people have expressed for "MOULIN ROUGE", for both its usage of creativity and for its stars, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I skipped seeing this film when it was playing at the movies but my curiosity was spiked by the time it hit the video rental shelves at my local video store."MOULIN ROUGE" has indeed garnered much favoritism from critic's circles, award panels and esteemed film reviewers alike. Unfortunately, the only award I would hand this film would be a Golden Raspberry.The opening sequence of "MOULIN ROUGE" was interesting enough. I enjoyed the camera sequence going through the city of old Paris as we are introduced to Ewan McGregor's character... and then the film pretty much falls flat on its face from thereon in.I am not Nicole Kidman's biggest fan. I did enjoy her in "THE OTHERS", but I have to say that her performance in this film would be about on par as that in "BMX BANDITS" or "BUSH CHRISTMAS". I thought the musical pieces in "MOULIN ROUGE" were 'ear-bleedingly' awful, especially the sequence where both Ewan and Nicole are serenading each other with snippets of songs such as "I Was Made For Loving You" and "Silly Love Songs". There is one truly awful moment in the film that involves a man screeching out an unforgivable horrendous rendition of The Police's "Roxanne".It was about the scene where John Leguizamo and his side-kicks gate-crash Ewan McGregor's personal home-warming to have him join their performing art troupe where Ewan finds himself bellowing out a sonnet of "The Hills Are Alive" from "THE SOUND OF MUSIC" that I found myself losing patience for this movie. My nerves and patience at that point were already at razor's edge. A special appearance by Kylie Minogue as 'The Green Fairy' in a 'Tinkerbell'-type role was the final straw for me.I shifted myself to the next room to work on the computer and for the next two hours, all I heard was non-stop 'yahooing' and music that resembled the sound a tin bucket would make after it was kicked down an endless flight of stairs. Towards the end, I was wondering aloud, "Please! Make the hurting stop!" The two other people I live with had already secretly exited the living room behind my back to escape the noise.I know that Nicole Kidman's main professional talent is targeted mainly towards acting. It is not a fair suggestion on my behalf to opine that she should work harder on the acting and leave the 'singing' thing alone altogether.I was very disappointed with this movie. For all the fabulous write-up it has been receiving from famous reviewers and everyday people like you and I, I was expecting a great deal more from "MOULIN ROUGE". I really REALLY wanted to like "MOULIN ROUGE", but I just couldn't get into it. Please don't accuse me of having a narrow mind because I am a very open-minded person when it comes to film projects. I am sure that Baz Luhrmann had a well-planned artistic dream when he put this film together. Unfortunately for me, it turned out to be one long nightmare. One reviewer on this web-site mentioned that they are "in love" with Moulin Rouge. I guess my motto would be, "I hate Moulin Rouge".My Rating: 1 out of 10

This movie blew my mind. Watch it, then watch it again. 'Moulin Rouge' made me laugh, cry, and dream. It's boldness and confidence to produce something so original and different impressed me. At times the scenery was as surreal as something you would experience in a dream, which only makes this movie more amazing. 'Moulin Rouge' shows love from all angles. It includes the raw passion, infatuation, vehemence, intensity, ecstasy, jealousy, and pain that is found in true love. The acting was staggering. Ewan McGregor is unrealistically perfect, combining sweet innocence with masculinity. Kidman perfectly brings out the seductive side of Satine, yet never loses the vulnerable soul that lies behind it. Roxburgh(The Duke) and Leguizamo(Lautrec) bring out just the right amount of comic relief in this intense drama. There is nothing I would change about this movie. One warning, though: Moulin Rouge is not for the artistically deprived. It is quite a contemporary movie, so you may not like it if you prefer to watch simple movies(ex. 'American Pie', 'Scary Movie').

The bad commercial campaigns of the best movie of all time failed to give Moulin Rouge! worldwide recognition, but alas, this happens with many great movies (e.g. Requiem For A Dream, Donnie Darko). The whole comparison between this and the new musical blockbuster Chicago is useless since they are both great movies but not the same. Still, Moulin Rouge! remains in the first place on the Best Movies list. This musical, comical, dramatical and action packed hell of a movie will satisfy the whole audience. It just needs to be given a chance. Never have I seen an audience stand up and clap, with tears in their eyes, at the magnificent movie they have watched.
   The story is very simple but very complicated at the same time, giving enough music, action and laughs for everybody's taste. The characters are very easy to relate to and the edge-of-your-seat directing gives edge to this masterpiece. Christian, a young writer arrives in Paris, against the will of his father, to seek a career as a writer. He meets a group of bohemians who are planning to set up a musical play at the famous club Moulin Rouge and they invite him to rewrite the story of their play but at the same time to lure the famous courtesan Satine as to star in their play. Satine confuses Christian with the Duke, who on the contrary is expected to sleep with Satine to finance the upcoming play. The confusion continues and finally Satine and Christian convince the Duke to accept to finance the play. As the play is made, Christian and Satine fall in love, but the Duke's rights to the play also count for the body of Satine. She is his. And so the lovers try to keep their love a secret before everything is lost. On the way, jealousy, betrayal and trust is needed for their love to be contained.
   Satine is portrayed by the beautiful Nicole Kidman who delivers an astonishing performance. Her character has so much life inside her which makes you fall in love with her. Nicole was truly the one for Satine, for her beauty and character match like no other. She did, in fact, break two ribs during the making of Moulin Rouge! Ewan McGregor, one of the finest young actors on the Hollywood A-List, plays the writer Christian with success. Christian is a three-dimensional character with feelings and compassion. Both of these excellent actors' singing and dancing skills help in the portrayal of their characters.    The direction is simply amazing. With the best director there is, what can someone expect? Baz Luhrmann shows us his creative and brilliant ideas through his direction, cinematography, editing and camera work. All of these factors give you a dazzling effect. The editing gives you enough to be kept at the edge of your seat and also to feel those small goosebumps running up and down your back. The music is absolutely fantastic. The idea of mixing old songs together and forming this huge masterpiece is just amazing. The original music created by Craig Armstrong, one of the finest, also has atmosphere and is truly brilliant.    Mr. Luhrmann also takes us comprehend the importance of the visual world of movies with Moulin Rouge! The whole movie is a visual attack, giving you enough colours to come back begging for more. It dazzles you amazingly and twists you around. The costumes are excellent and the sets are simply fantastic. The mixture of all of these given to you by the editing will leave you speechless and coming back to watch it over and over again.
   Moulin Rouge! is a movie for the people. It has something everyone can relate to. It has been an instant classic ever since it came out in the cinemas. The more you watch Moulin Rouge!, the more you get addicted to it and the songs can even make you sing along. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor show off their acting and singing capabilities and at the same time director Baz Luhrmann mixes them together and forms his finest masterpiece up to date. Moulin Rouge! makes you proud for who you are and will make you fall in love with it. This is a movie about Truth, Beauty, Freedom and above all thing, Love...Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 10/10 - A True Masterpiece

I went to see 'Moulin Rouge' with high expectations: I was not disappointed. On a big screen, in a traditional 'red curtain' cinema, it enveloped me in colour, music, dancing and dazzling visual fantasy. I laughed, I cried, I went out and bought the soundtrack!The plot is simple: 'La Dame aux Camélias', with added vitality from a colourful crew of comic supporting players. Behind the modernity of the visual effects and use of familiar pop songs in the soundtrack (each prompting a delighted gasp or laugh of recognition from my friends and myself), this is an old-fashioned musical with a warm, uncynical heart. It's just over 2 hours of romantic escapism - which we all need a shot of, from time to time.Our ingénu hero Christian (Ewan McGregor) arrives in Paris, fleeing his strict father, to become a writer. With echoes of 'La Bohème', he falls in with a motley crew of bohemians, or rather, *they* fall in on him. Literally. Through the ceiling. In an attempt to obtain financial backing for his friends' new play, he falls in love with the beautiful and ambitious cabaret singer and courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). Their romance is threatened by the scheming Duc de Monroth (pronounce it French-style - and remember 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend'!), who holds the deeds of the Moulin Rouge as security on gaining Satine's favours. But a still greater danger is lurking, as Satine begins to suffer fainting fits and cough blood when she comes off stage...Where Baz Luhrmann and his team have worked wonders is in revitalising the musical - a genre which has been fading in the West - by looking to the East, to Bollywood, where it has never died. 'Moulin Rouge' is essentially a westernised Bollywood film, blending comedy and tragedy with stunning visual style and lively song-and-dance numbers. The climactic scene from the Indian-themed show Christian has written, 'Spectacular Spectacular!' acknowledges the film's key stylistic influence.Meanwhile, Christian's public humiliation of Satine, hurling money at her feet, is straight from the original Dumas novel. The carpet of scattered red and white petals which surround the lovers at the tragic end - long anticipated, but still heart-wrenching when it comes - are surely a nod to Marguerite Gautier's camellias. If the modernity of approach has jarred some ears, well, a previous, less humorous musical version had similar problems in the 1850s: but Verdi's 'La Traviata' nevertheless has been a great hit ever since!There are also nods to other influences: the Méliès-inspired 'magic lantern slide' vistas of Paris, lit by a smiling, singing moon; and 'La Fée Verte' - Kylie Minogue's red-eyed Absinthe Fairy - zipping over the city and illuminating it with her wand in a cheeky parody of the Disney version of Tinker Bell!The songs have been used effectively, to advance the story and illuminate character. 'El Tango de Roxanne' is a particularly striking piece, underscoring the tensions and jealousies when Satine is on the point of sacrificing herself to the Duc. The 'Elephant Love Medley' is delightful - funny and romantic, while 'On with the Show' makes the most of the dramatic power inherent in so many 'Queen' songs. And I will never hear 'Like a Virgin' again without thinking of its use as a comedy number by the endearing Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler...!'Moulin Rouge' is an enchanting way to spend an evening. It glitters and shimmers like Art Nouveau favrile glass. The costumes, sets, photography and choreography deserve every award going! I can see this film becoming a standard Christmas classic when it reaches TV, or becoming a cult movie, with sing-along audiences dressing up as the characters. Certainly joining in with boos, cheers, and laughs is an essential part of the fun! To be watched with a shot of 'Green Fairy' close at hand! I cannot wait to see what Baz Luhrmann - the cinematic 'Wizard of Oz' - will do next!

Another reviewer on IMDb describes the picture as a musical for people who don't like musicals. I think I can say that pretty much sums it up for me. I found the movie to be colorful, clever, whimsical, absurd, bawdy and ultimately triumphant. What I wasn't expecting following an introduction of a 1900 Paris setting was the overly anachronistic use of song snippets from a vast array of sources ranging from 'The Sound of Music' to the Beatles, Madonna, Elton John, and U2, with an homage of sorts thrown in to Bowie's Diamond Dogs. It all works to add up to an entertaining couple of hours marked by an explosive use of color that's simply dazzling. If you need to know about the story, it's all about freedom, beauty, truth and love, emphasis on love with an accent provided by entrepreneur Zidler (Jim Broadbent) punching out The Duke (Richard Roxburgh). Prepare to be surprised by actors who can sing, as Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman handle their tunes skillfully as star crossed lovers coming to terms with impending disaster. I'd say more but other reviewers have done so more competently. I'm just surprised by how much I liked this picture, and if you're of a similar frame of mind, I'd offer the advice of the showman ringmaster who said at one point - "...if you can hunk-hunk, you can hunkadoodle with them". I couldn't have said it better.

If you're in love, this is the ultimate film for you. This is an emotional ride, not the kind you should watch with frowned foreheads trying to analyse it; but the kind you should watch with a light heart and an open mind. The whole film feels exactly like how the world looks when you're in love - everything's so dream-like, fabulous, spectacular, emotional.It's just utterly entertaining! It's touching at one time, funny at another....Firstly, the music is GREAT - there are the likes of David Bowie, Rufus Wainwright, Beck, Alka Yagnik... even just listening to the soundtrack CD alone is an ultimate emotional ride enough. Visually, the cinematography, costumes, sets, and choreography are just stunning. They work great as a whole and resulting in a dramatic eye candy. The plot, although simple, WORKS.So sit back, dim your lights, unplug your phones - and get ready for a fantastical, romantic 'dream' that is Moulin Rouge.

I watched this on DVD with my boyfriend, it was rather a case of not being able to agree on any other to rent. To be honest by the time we got home I was starting to think I would have a bath and wash my hair instead.Gosh my hair can go dirty. This film was Fab, Terrific, Super Duper. At 40something years of age I was laughing and crying at a musical the worrying thing is so was my boyfriend.I dont know where to start, it was visually sensational, the music was Fab. We were delighted each time another song came along that we knew (must buy the sound track), the casting fantastic, direction superb it even had a good story......well ok it was one big fantasy that I was happy to be taken into and given an emotional ride.

I am a bit late in writing a review for this movie (like 18 years) but I don't really normally write reviews. But I'm watching it this evening and I just feel like I have to say that I have loved this film ever since I first saw it back in 2002, I wore out a DVD copy because I watched it that much.Everything about it is sheer perfection, the sets, the lighting, the music, the costumes, the actors, the script, the coloring, the camera work...literally everything is just perfect to me. I cannot ever describe how much I love this movie but Come What May (had to slip in a song title somewhere) it will remain in my movie library for the rest of my life!!

Favourable reaction to this movie is a good example of a common problem - audiences rewarding something because it's different, regardless of whether it's actually good.Luhrman has good intentions, but he sabotages his own movies by overloading the viewer's senses.The idea to make a period musical where the actors sing contemporary pop songs has great potential, but the storyline is incredibly simplistic, and Luhrmann seems completely incapable of dealing in genuine human emotions, which makes for a hollow movie-going experience.Still, there are a few inspired moments (the movie's high point is the 'Roxanne' number near the end, one of the only times the movie has any emotional power).

*Moulin SPOILERS!* Paris, France, 1900; young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) begins to write the story of his and Moulin Rouge's late star Satine (Nicole Kidman), nicknamed 'The Sparkling Diamond', both a showgirl and a courtesan in France's most famous nightclub-slash-bordello,'s love, which began almost by mistake and grew despite the presence of a big enemy, the childish and scary Duke (Richard Roxburgh), while rehearsing for the big production 'Spectacular, Spectacular' which was supposed to make a real actress out of Satine...Anyone who has seen this movie can attest that it's exuberant, exciting, not afraid of appearing ridiculous, going at a breakneck speed, brightly colored, exceptionally able to switch from comedy to tragedy, that the songs are exceptionally well chosen (even though I'd have liked to see that famous 'Father And Son' scene on the screen - the song is one of my favorites) and that the actors can sing - especially Nicole, Richard (even though he didn't get to sing a lot - only a few verses from 'Like A Virgin') and Ewan.One thing's for sure; this movie's not for everybody. But the people this movie is for will surely be able to appreciate it fully.Moulin Rouge!: 9/10.

Christian (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with Santine (Nicole Kidman) at the Moulin Rouge. She loves him too, but she's promised to the evil Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh). What will she do? Who cares? The film looks incredible but has quite a few major problems...virtually the whole movie is shot in extreme quick cuts making it difficult to know what's going on; the film veers wildly from comedy to satire to tragedy without ever finding a comfortable medium between them; it's too long; all the "songs" are just snatches of popular songs from the past--it's not cute or clever, just annoying (and confusing); Kidman (a very good actress) gives a very bad performance and that's no depth in any of the characters so it's really hard to give a damn. Also John Leguiziamo gives one of his worst performances (and that's saying something). The movie has just two pluses--the truly stunning visuals and McGregor gives out a very good performance--and what a beautiful singing voice! He ALMOST saves the movie. Not recommended.

Gag me with a giant MTV spoon! This was like watching MTV for 3 hours without a break. If you like that sort of thing then go see this movie. If however you like movies to have an interesting plot, authentic acting, characters you can care about and a camera that stays still for a few seconds at least, then save your money. Nicole looks good but the sex-appeal is just not there. The music is silly. I felt sorry for the actors. The supporting cast is forced to do the worst acting of their lives. The whole thing is just an expensive failure in film making.
