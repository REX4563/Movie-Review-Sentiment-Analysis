I'll be first to admit that I hate teen comedies in general and typically frown upon most of them - I didn't even like "There's Something About Mary" too much, although I'm not sure it's really a "teen" film.I own all three "American Pie" films on DVD because they are one of the few teen series whose characters seem real and you actually feel empathy for. They're not awkward characterizations of real people without emotions - the movie takes time setting up their personalities, quirks, etc., and then places them in embarrassing situations. For example, the movie "Swingers." That telephone call Favreau makes is a painful experience for the viewer. Would it have been so painful if we hadn't gotten to know him throughout the movie? "American Pie" is kinda like that. It works well because of the characters. It's crude, yes. It's crass, very. It's sexist, maybe. But that's how guys are. It doesn't exploit these elements as many teen sex comedies do - some are moderately entertaining (like the Johnny Depp film "Private Resort") but unbelievable and basically just lots of skin. "American Pie" is better, one of the best of its genre.Everyone seems to hate the first sequel, which was released in 2001, a couple years after the original. Jim (Biggs) returns from college and hangs out for the summer at a beach house with his best pals. But with Stiffler (Seann William Scott) there, it's not too easy because they soon end up in more embarrassing situations.This movie is very similar to the original and normally I have a problem with this. Basically all the scenes are "updates" on scenes that existed in the original. E.g. the lesbian strip over the walkie-talkies, the incident with the glue, the whole thing with Stiffler's mom and Finch.Nevertheless it is effective, entertaining and funny. The characters are given more room to develop and believe it or not, I think I like this better than the first film. (The third is probably my favorite, if only for the focus on Stiffler and the introduction of Fred Willard, one of the great character actors of our time.) "American Pie 2" is somewhat recycled and some people may find it one of those "pointless" sequels, but I liked it, and this is coming from a guy who typically loathes these films - so considering I'm giving this seven stars, that says quite a lot. Either I'm out of my mind or there's something about these films that's just more accessible and likable than others in their genre.

I saw the movie in theaters and laughed out loud.  Now, I rented the DVD. I can't say I got as many laughs as the first time, though, and I started to notice more flaws.  At first I thought this movie was better than the original.  Now I'm not sure.  They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale.The two films movie at a similar rhythm.  In the original, we opened with Jim's Dad walking in on him while masturbating.  In the sequel, he walks in on him while he's having sex, only it's taken to the next level with the girlfriend's parents walking in as well.  And we have the keg party, with a Steadicam shot following Stiffler around, who yet again gets into a mishap with bodily fluids.  And of course, in homage of the famous Nadia scene from the original, we have the guys walking in on two lesbians.
The laughs are still there, and there are some genuinely funny moments.  I don't want to give them away, though the previews and some of the other reviewers probably already did.The cast still got it.  Eugene Levy steals the show yet again as Jim's Dad. I do have to say, Stiffler's character got a little too obnoxious at times. It's often funny to hear his foul-mouthed insults, but by the hundredth time you hear him use the word "f**kface" it gets kinda old.
I'm always going to hold the "American Pie" movies several notches above the standard gross-out teen comedies, because they have zest and originality. Not to mention they're done in a professional manner.  The gags are as intelligent as they are crude, and delivered with exquisite timing.  And to top it off, it's a heartfelt film that is not literally all about getting laid.  I thought the original had more heart to it, but the sequel also has its heart in the right place.The music is great.  The soundtrack is full of really cool songs, including "Smooth Criminal" by Alien Ant Farm.  And be sure to check out the unrated DVD special edition.  The commentary is cool and--unlike with the first "American Pie" unrated edition--there is some bonus footage worth checking out.  The lesbian scene is extended significantly.  In the theatrical version, there was only a brief nudity, but you get to see much more in this version.I'm still not sure if I would consider this movie better than the first, but it is one sequel that lives up to the original--and that's saying a lot!My score:  7 (out of 10)

Raunch used to be so simple! You'd go see Porky's, you knew you were gonna see some T&A. Oh, and maybe a small heartfelt lesson about how people are generally good, even those who are different from us, as long as we have the same goal of getting laid in mind. Those were such wonderful days! Now, everyone's more jaded, even (especially) the kids. You show a kid the shower scene from Porky's, and he'll love it, but I bet after the first few viewings it won't be as much fun. Kids need something new all the time. Now, American Pie is an R-rated film, so at least the intended audience isn't the teen crowd, exactly, but then neither was Porky's (or any of its knock offs). The cast from the original American Pie is reunited. The time is now one year later, and the gang's home from college for the summer. Jim (Jason Biggs) still has his sexual hang-ups. Remember Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), the band-camp girl? Jim went to the prom with her, and she didn't talk to him after that. But don't worry, she's at band camp again and figures prominently in this movie. It seems Nadia, the exchange student whose escapades with Jim made the Internet, is back in the country and is ready to hook up with our hapless lead character. What to do! Jim still has no experience. The guys try to help him out by renting a lakeside cottage for the summer. Meanwhile, Stifler's (Seann William Scott) still trying to hump everything in sight; Oz (Chris Klein) is remaining celibate while his girlfriend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in France; Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still lusting after the legendary mother of Stifler, after their much-talked-about union at the party in the first movie; and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is aching after his breakup with Vicky (Tara Reid). There have been no drastic character changes, either; everyone's as you'd expect after a year of college. Which means, of course, that all the guys are hornier than a sex addict in a penny whorehouse. But that's what drives raunch comedies - the testosterone of single-minded males.   As in real life, although the males in the movie have grown up, they still think like high school kids. (And someday this nubile cast will learn that that particular characteristic never really leaves the male of the species!) But while the theme of the movie is sex, sex, and sex, hidden under the layer of bombast and teenage oversexdrive is a theme of tenderness and fallibility. When kids graduate high school, they think they know it all. "Bring life on!" they chortle with glee. "We know it all!" But there's a certain vulnerability that everyone feels at some point, and that's the issue of sexual conduct for the first time. And here's where American Pie 2 deviates from other raunch films. In those yesteryear movies, there was always tremendous pressure for one schlub to get lucky once and for all. I'm talking huge peer pressure! But in this movie, while all of Jim's friends want him to get laid, they never, ever make him feel like he's below average or beneath them because he's not experienced what they have. And that, to me, makes this a very special movie - although, rest assured, it's still as raunchy as the first one.   In addition, the ending is so unlike those earlier raunchfests that you actually sit there and admire the screenwriters for not, for once, pandering to the least common denominator.   But hold on! Don't look at me like that! You're thinking that if it has good intentions and good messages, how much fun could it really be? Trust me, if you enjoyed the pastry coitus in the first movie, you'll get a kick out of Jim's misadventures in this one, too. The writing is way above par for movies in this genre, and the cast is both lovely to look at more than capable in their deliveries and actions.

I liked this movie and got a lot of laughs out of it. It wasn't as good as the original, but then again, most sequels aren't.   This movie is basically several funny skits all thrown together.  And some of the jokes are just repeats from the original, but others are new. So, that's why this comedy works.
But, why did they even bring the girls back from the original except for Michelle.  Vicky, Nadia, Heather, Jessica added nothing to this movie. Each one of them only had a couple of lines.  The guys are what makes it work. Jim and Stifler are the funniest of them all.  And Jim's dad is great too.
FINAL VERDICT: It's funny. It's raunchy. Its got lesbian and porn scenes. What more could you ask for from a comedy!

Sure the old saying is that sequel can never measure up its predecessor can be held true to this sequel of the 'American Pie" sequel with the same characters and roughly the same jokes and gags repeat themselves which means that the surprises are gone and the shocks are not as fresh. When Stifler's (Seann William Scott) mom (Jennifer Coolidge) showed up it was heaven send. In "American Pie" her presence has been reduced as an inside joke. In the first film Jim (Jason Biggs) and Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) are oblivious in that they were having sex while being streamed on the Internet. In the sequel, strangers caught onto a sex scene by way of CB radios.In spite of the eat, sleep, conquer, repeat scenario we get in "American Pie 2", it's still an enjoyable raunchy comedy in which the characters are the perfect comic archetypes and they all play their respected roles like I would've expected in a movie like this. Aside from the raunchy comedy elements with a plethora of sexual innuendo used for humour, the characters depicted here offer sympathy due to their overall likable nature. It's great that Eugene Levy is back as the world's most level-headed father of Jim who always has his son's back no matter what sticky situation he's in (pun intended). There are so many memorable scenes that you wish you were part of the action and taking part in the gang's many sexual misadventures just for the thrills.It was refreshing that the gang was back for the second serving of pie. Not because they were all obligated to return due to their contractual stances, but simply because they all enjoyed the first outing and because the film needed a bit of continuation of closure to some of the subplots. So after a year of graduating from high school, the gang just finished a year of college so they decide to get a sigh of relief by spending their summer hiatus partying at a summer cottage by the lake in Grand. Haven, Michigan.We can take a great deal of empathy for Jim due to the many disasters he encountered in his last outing. Getting his sex scenes exploited on the Internet, his fist sexual encounter was one major miscalculation after another, and his prom was a night he'll never forget, though he wished he would. When he gets the news that Nadia is returning for the summer, he hires Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) to offer him some types on getting proper intercourse with her. Sure she might be a little wacky at times, but has a good heart and takes it upon herself to teach him the basics.The biggest flaw was that the most fleshed out scene is not the most interesting. It involves the gang imprisoned in the cottage and are now subservient by the.two occupants of the house who may or may not be lesbians, though the gang thinks they are. The girls (Denise Faye and Lisa Arturo) blackmail the boys by putting on show for them if the guys engage in uncompromising activities in exchange to watch them engage in sexual activity. There are some funny moments, but this scene wears out its welcome progressively. There's some poor taste in humour when Jim enters band camp pretending that he's a special needs trombone player.Even though with the exception of Michelle, the female characters play smaller roles than their male co-stars, they're not just vulnerable sex kittens used as trophy prizes for the guys. They have just as much raunchiness too like Heather (Mena Suvari) gets her boyfriend, Oz (Chris Klein) to engage in phone sex while she's studying overseas in Spain. Meanwhile Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and ex-girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) lie to each other about the myriad of sex partners they encountered while in college. Sure after this movie, they launched two more installments after this one, with the gang now married with kids and then almost a decade later, they reunited for a reunion. And through the wrinkle, receding hairlines, and progressively growing grey hairs, the one thing that had never changed all those years, their hunger for sex. As long as the dessert is not served with a slice of pie.

The first film was a big box office hit and a highly successful teen movie, and many of the fans must have been thrilled that every member of the cast of the original were coming back for a sequel, from director J.B. Rogers (Say It Isn't So). Basically Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have all returned to their hometown in East Great Falls, Michigan after finishing their first year of college, and naturally they attend the party hosted by still oversexed Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott), but this is cut short by the police. With nowhere to party because of the police Kevin finds out that there is a beach house in Grand Harbor, Michigan, so the four friends, plus Stifler for rent, pack their bags and make themselves comfortable, finding work as painters and decorators to pay the rent and prepare for the big party. Kevin is feeling awkward with ex-girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) back in town and he feels may want to get back with her. Oz is missing girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari) who is away in Spain and they keep their relationship going with attempted phone sex. Finch have discovered the sexual art of Tantra to keep in his desires as he waits patiently for the opportunity to possibly get with his goddess, Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). Jim is worried because Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) will be returning, and he feels his lack of sexual experience will put her off, so he seeks sex tips and advice from his prom date Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan). Stifler is fascinated to see that the painted house owners Danielle (Denise Faye) and Amber (Lisa Arturo) may be lesbians, and with Jim and Finch he breaks in to find his proof, and they return and catch them they decide to mess with the boys, giving them homosexual acts in exchange for them doing it, e.g. the girls kiss if the boys kiss, and for a while they go with it. Jim's confidence problems only get worse when Stifler provides him lubricant, and distracted by pornography he unintentionally grabs super glue he used earlier to masturbate, and he ends up with his hand glued to his penis, the other to the porn video, at hospital, supported by his Dad (Eugene Levy) he is told there will be swelling for a while, and he is shocked to see Nadia arriving early. While preparations for the big party get underway, Jim has Michelle pretend to be his girlfriend until everything is ready and he has all the tips he needs, and with his penis back to normal they fake breaking up on the day of the party. So the party gets underway, Kevin is crushed Vicky has a boyfriend, Finch disappointed earlier that his goddess was not coming spends his time talking philosophically to various women, Oz has Heather surprise him having taken an early flight, and Jim lets Nadia down saying that he realises he has feelings for Michelle. The party is a big success, all the guests drinking and dancing with joy, with Jim and Michelle becoming boyfriend-girlfriend, Kevin and Vicky happy as friends, Oz and Heather still happy together, and Stifler ecstatic in bed with Danielle and Amber who turned out to be bisexual, even Chuck 'The Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) scoring with Nadia. The end sees the boys packed and ready to go home, promising that if they can they will do the same again every summer, and Finch is happy to say Stifler's Mom, real name Janine, pop by and pick him up to go and have sex again. Also starring Natasha Lyonne as Jessica, Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom, Justin Isfeld as Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1, John Cho as John - 'MILF' Guy #2, Eli Marienthal as Stifler's Brother, Casey Affleck as Tom Myers, Joelle Carter as Natalie, Bean's Larry Drake as Natalie's Dad, Lee Garlington as Natalie's Mom and Austin Powers' Kevin Cooney as Doctor. The cast are still as likable as ever, Biggs more foolish than before, Thomas weirder with his holding in of an orgasm, Scott much more foul-mouthed and sex-obsessed, and Levy in his moments still amusing and embarrassing. The story is simple, just teens getting back together to drink a lot, have sex and party hard, but the slapstick and dialogue jokes still work when they need to, the highlights are Stifler being peed on, the terrible trumpet playing, the phone sex scene, the lesbian fun and the super gluing, it is a fun comedy. Good!

I love revisiting movies I haven't seen in years, as it's like a whole new experience. I have forgotten so much about this movie, but remembered enough to have an old friend feeling when watching. Picks up the summer after their first year of college and they guys, along with Stifler, get a lake house to have one big huge Summer end party. All sorts of hijinks, raunchy sexcapades, and fantastic heartfelt humor fill this sequel. Great movie, full of laughs, and an absolute must for anyone who likes the first, or just like to laugh in general.
This movie is almost true to life as the expectation of high school friends after the first year of college.

American Pie 2 (2001, Dir. James B. Rogers) The whole gang are back and shows that they are as close as ever. They decide to get even closer, by spending the summer together at a beach house. They decide to hold the biggest party ever to be seen, even if the preparation doesn't always go to plan. Especially when Stifler, Finch and Jim become more close to each other than they ever want to be and when Jim mistakes super glue for lubricant.When the 'American Pie' gang returns, everyone knows that they will be expecting gross out humour and wild characters, and this movie doesn't disappoint. All the wonderful characters are back, including Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad, who steals every scene he is in. Stifler is his usual self and Finch is more entertaining this time. A lot of the female side of cast have a reduced role in this movie. Alyson Hannigan's role is expanded, whilst the others only appear in a few scenes. The jokes again are well written, but like the first film, are not the most cleanest of jokes. If you saw the first movie, then you would know what kind of adult material is found in this film. Although, the film holds up well alongside it's predecessor, it had a slight decrease in the comedy. Still, it's a fun and entertaining movie to watch."The force is strong with that one." - Stifler (Seann William Scott)

Good as the first one American Pie this sequel in my opinion is the best party sequel about college guys ever. This was my favorite movie of the first two movies in high school at the time. I was in senior year before I transher to other school. This in my opinion is good as the first one. All the gangs are back and they decied to make their own party since Stifler party was busted by cops. Great comedy, sexy, friendship, intelligent and smart. It is my third favorite in the "American Pie" franchise.American Pie 2 pick's off where the first one left off it is been one year since the guys loose their virginty and they attendet collage. Some couples are together some broke up. The first year of college is over for Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Reuniting back in East Great Falls to trade stories about sexual escapades and university life, the boys find themselves having to deal with the women (Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan, Mena Suvari, and Shannon Elizabeth) they rudely left behind. Determined to make the most out of the promising summer, the guys, along with their revolting but affluent friend Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), decide to rent a beach house to help sort out their confused, combustible lives. Running into mischievous lesbians, masturbation sessions stymied by Krazy Glue, the wonders of band camp, Jim's Dad (the invaluable Eugene Levy), Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge), and parties galore, the four young men learn valuable life lessons as they awkwardly navigate all the tomfoolery of their summer break.This movie is about party on the beach house and the boys decide to make one of the best summer ever. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Vicky (Tara Reid) are no longer together weird, I did not like that. Jim (Jason Biggs) is still deeply in love with Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), but asks Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) the band geek to help him out, so he could get better in sex. Oz (Chris Klein) and Heather (Mena Suvari) are still together but they are MILES seperated because Heather goes to study to Europe. Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still horny about Stifler's mom MILF (Jennifer Coolidge). Stifler (Seann William Scott) is still a dick and he is brother Matt (Eli Marienthal) is funny.The film is outrages laughable I have the VHS home and I do have to Blu-ray disc which contains Unrated version of the movie diffrent from the teacrical cut I used to had. The movie has jokes like Jim glues him self, I really like Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) defending his son after a older woman attacks JIm about his sex orientation, when he had a VHS tape glue on his hand. I would stick up for my son that way too. Shannon Elizabeth is still gorgeous in this movie she is great and sexy as Nadia. Gorgeous Tara Reid is awesome in this movie. Mena Suvari is hot. Sherminator (Chfris Owen) is back in this movie and he lands up with Nadia funny. We have two lesbians in this movie who force the boys to jerk off Stifler's private part. Denise Fey and Lisa Arturo were great as Danielle and Amber as two lesbians.Love the soundtracks: Blind Spot by Transmatic, Want You Bad by The Ofspring, Blink 182 - Every Time I Look For You, Good For a Woman by Alien ant farm-smooth criminal and more songs. James B. Rogers directed well this sequel so it is one of the best comedy's of 2000's. They don't make em like this anymore. My third favorite "American Pie" movie.

I liked this movie and got a bunch of laughs out of it. I couldn't say it was as good as the original, most sequels aren't. This movie is basically several funny skits all thrown together. And some of the jokes are just repeats from the original student life, but others are new. It works.But, why did they even study the girls back from the original except for Michelle. Vicky, Nadia, Heather, Jessica added nothing to learn something new. Each one of them only had a couple of lines as we learn it in school. No special things. The scholars are what makes it work. Jim and Stifler are the funniest of them all. And Jim's dad is awesome.FINAL VERDICT: It's funny. It's raunchy. To get and learn more it can work as it definitely helps you to get more knowledge about not ideal adult and college life.

First of all, this is (of course) a film for people who want to laugh (mainly at others screwing up). Especially Jim (Jason Biggs) seems to get himself in the most embarrassing situations over and over again. But there are other funny moments too, with the Stifmeister (Sean William Scott), Ozzy (Chris Klein), Kev (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finchy (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Mainly the film is about what moves people my age and any other age most, the opposite sex. All that obsessing and wondering about the other (does he / she like me, do I love him / her?) is really greatly portrayed and realistic. Of course the people in the film are all not too shabby looking and there are some sick and perverted moments in the film, but you really have to look at the bigger picture. You have to look past the objectification of women, the booze and the parties. You have to look past that 'every guy's 'perfect summer' and see that this film is not about sex, it is not about being sexy and cool. This film is about being whoever you are, being true to yourself and your friends, but most of all it is about love. I mean the latter thing may not be true for all characters in the film (e.g. Steve Stifler), but it sure concerns the 'main characters' life (Jimbo's life). The rest of the film is however pure fun and freedom, that any college student hopes to get. I sure hope my first summer of being in college will rock like that. Can't wait to see the sequel. And again, I do not think I have to force someone to make a sequel.8 out of 10Note: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time. Apologies for any offence caused. I was young and stupid at the time, thinking I was being 'cool'.

Well here we are, back for more of the same antics we got in American Pie. There may be a sense we've seen this all before but somehow American Pie 2 really works. All the characters we know and love (or hate) from the original are back and they're constantly being placed into outrageous situations which will inspire gut-busting laughs. Even though we're going back over much of the same territory, the sequel is more consistently and explosively funny than the original. What could have easily been a pointless, unnecessary sequel actually manages to be something fresh, funny and appealing.As with the original the Jason Biggs character of Jim is the glue holding the film together. Everything revolves around him in one way or another. Where in the original film each of the main male characters came with his own romantic storyline this time around Jim takes center stage. Most of the female characters have been shunted to the sidelines here with Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne being mere bit players. Their absence doesn't hurt at all and may actually help by making the story more focused. This one's all about the boys with Jim and friends renting a summer home following their first year of college. Back for more hilarity are Chris Klein as Oz, Eddie Kaye Thomas as the increasingly bizarre Finch and Thomas Ian Nicholas as the comparatively dull Kevin. And even though none of the others like him the script finds a way to contrive to get Seann William Scott's juvenile, vulgar, obnoxious Stifler tossed into the mix. Where the other guys might go to the edge of what is appropriate Stifler is always willing to go careening over the edge and his antics are a hoot.If you thought nothing could be more embarrassing than what happened to Jim in the original film, just wait. And along to heighten the embarrassment is Jim's father, played wonderfully by Eugene Levy, who in trying to help inevitably just makes things worse. And the one female from the original who actually has a major role here, Alysson Hannigan as Michelle, also does a great job. Oh, the wacky things that go on at band camp. With a slew of familiar characters moving from one hilarious situation to the next, all backed by a winning soundtrack, American Pie 2 succeeds in equaling and even surpassing the original.

The story is none existent but there was never surposed to be one. Group of guys that want to have sex end of story. The first one was good but this one is just as funny.I was the right age in 2001 for this movie so it will always hold a special place in my heart. If you want a laugh, some blink 182 / sum 41 tunes in the background then watch it.It's not the greatest film ever made but it's getting a 7/10 for laughs and the related subject in every boys life growing up.Their all on Now TV binge watch them all, you wont be disappointed.

Caution: spoilers.Before I begin, a few points about taste and suitability. Firstly, this film is crude, childish, and by many people's standards obscene: it features bare breasts, swearing and numerous attempts at pre-marital sex. Secondly, if you were expecting Citizen Kane, they you have bought the wrong video. Direction and cinematography are not the main aims of this work of art. Humour, however, is.And it is funny. Puerile, base, vulgar and unkind, but funny. Characters get things jammed up their bottoms, glue hands to genitals, and more. It is like a Donald McGill seaside postcard, enlarged and moved to America.The plot is simple: five friends sit in a beach-house planning a party, each with his own girl problems to solve come party time. Next door are two pretty, tactile ladies who might be lesbians. Comedy ensues.The film divides itself between our hero, Jim, preparing for the arrival of a Russian girl who he believes to be a "sure thing", and the others in the house. There are two serious subplots: one of the friends has a girlfriend who lives far away, and another is trying to get back with his ex.Much of the comedy relies on whether you can stand the characters and stomach what happens to them. The odious Stifler, for instance, seems too much a bully to be likable, and the scenes where he is humiliated gain something from this. Jim, on the other hand, is basically decent, and whilst laughable, we want him to succeed.I found the two serious subplots of little interest: I am older than the ideal age-group, and they don't really seem very applicable to me now. Were I 18, they might well do, although they do weigh the comedy down. Also, perhaps deliberately, the character chasing his ex appears simply wretched rather than likable. Still, viewers may learn something.Which brings me onto the fact that this film is, basically, moral. Forget the sex and farting jokes: at base, the film is broadly correct about the way men and women behave, and falls on the side of decency. The central relationship between Jim and Michelle (an excellent turn from Alyson Hannigan, at once weird, funny and sympathetic) is sweetness with a thin veneer of crudity, and shows the real heart of the film. Excellent also is Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad, embarrassing and hilarious, but protective and sincere. For silly, throwaway entertainment, this scores highly. If you are a vicar or Pauline Kael, don't bother, but if you are looking for a film that is simple fun, this does well. The characters and subplots make it uneven - I often ended up waiting for the action to switch to better characters - but there are moments of real hilarity so long as you can tolerate the rudeness that comes with them. This film will inevitably offend and disgust more prudish viewers, but for someone willing to watch silly vulgarity without throwing all moral sense to the wind, it is one of the classics of its type. Besides, morality is what you make it. To my mind, compared to the gross, gloating, sado-masochistic excess of The Passion of The Christ, it seems wholesome indeed.

I loved the original film and had pretty high expectations going into this one. While I enjoyed it all the way through, something just felt off, and the lesbian scene felt unnecesary. The characters stayed the same for the most part and I ain't complaining, I loved how relatable they were from the first one and they felt real, so I didn't mind how this was a 'characters get into weird scenarios the movie'. The refrences were nice I guess and the soundtrack too..I haven't got much to say.

Considering how great the first one was, I'm a little disappointed over this movie. It just seemed like they pretty much remade the first, just taking it a little further, making it more gross and more extreme, which may work for some fans of the first, but I honestly enjoyed the realness and laid-back feeling of the first far more than the gross scenes and stereotypes. Now, the stereotypes and the gross scenes are multiplied, to a point where it just gets a little tiresome. The apparent lack of any real original ideas, rather than just rehashes of the first, was a bit annoying too. But, all in all, it's an OK sequel, and a reasonably good teen comedy. The plot is OK, but it just seems too much like it was made up just in order to make a sequel to the first. The characters are a little too stereotypical, and not as well-written and real as they were the in first one. The humor is more or less the same, too much the same, in fact, as many of the jokes are just reused from the same formula as the first, like several of the scenes. Overall, the movie is not as good as the first, but it's OK. It's worth watching, if you want to see the characters again. I recommend this to fans of the first, and fans of teen comedies in general. 7/10

The five "lovable" morons from "American Pie" are back.  This movie is about their first summer after freshman year in college.  They all get together and rent a beautiful cottage to throw parties and have sex.  Naturally supposedly hilarious sexual hijinks occur.  I'm no fan of the first film (I thought it was pretty sick and I don't find sexual humiliation funny), but this is actually better.  The humor is toned down (although Jason Biggs' character gets in some pretty sick situations) and I admit I laughed out loud a few times.  It looks better than the first film and the performances are slightly (only slightly) better.  Unfortunately the film is incredibly sexist (no shock there) and there's an ugly homophobic sequence.  Still, I'd lie if I said I didn't enjoy myself.  It's also kind of admirable for a sequel to actually tone down its raunchiness instead of trying to outdo the original.  And Alyson Hannigan is absolutely wonderful (again) in this film. She was one of the sole saving graces in the first and is again.  As for the guys--Jason Biggs still can't act and seems destined to make a career out of being humiliated; Seann William Scott is absolutely appalling and unfunny; Chris Klein is given the thankless good guy role but pulls it off; Thomas Ian Nicholas hardly registers and Eddie Kaye Thomas actually is a worse actor than Biggs and very annoying.  So, if you like the first one you'll probably love this.

American pie 2 succeeds because all the soppy, sentimental slop from the first is absent. But one of the main problems with this film is that all the ridiculous, poorly developed character who serve as nothing but filler are still very much in place,. I mean, what on earth is Nadia doing in this film? She was a one dimensional character to begin with, and the ringed every possible gag from her already, so why bother to include her in the movie? A lot of the film is filled with problems like that, but at the end of the day it has enough funny bits still included to actually be very funny! The scene where the two girls make the guys kiss is the best in this average film!

American Pie 2 is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and my personal favorite from the series. Not only does it deliver great comedy, but also showcases the evolution of the characters and how they face their first summer back from college. This is something that I think resonates with a lot of people and it was one of the reasons why I loved it. So 1 year later, we see Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch & Stifler get back to hanging out and looking to spend the perfect summer by partying their asses off. For this they will have to move to the lakeside and rent a beach house in order to end their holidays with a memorable farewell party. Friendships will be tested, realizations will arise, as well as love, and in the end we get to find out if these group's bond was made stronger from the experience. For starters, this movie once again delivers in its trademark raunchiness with hilarious moments mainly involving Jim, but also Stifler. Storywise, we see the maturity most of these characters have garnered. I think the one that truly sees this in the best way is Kevin, as he is still clinging on to his old life, trying to be with Vicki and hanging out with his group. But Vicki only wants to be friends, and so Kevin learns that he must not live in the past, while also accepting the promising future he has. For me American Pie 2 is a great sequel to an already great movie. In fact, for me, it eclipses the original and makes for an even better experience. It's funny, disgusting and most of all entertaining in every aspect. Rating: 10/10

A slightly more over the top and over glamorous sequel to the pie humping original. Pie 2 is still packed with great one liners and jokes. There are few better teen comedies than the American Pie series.

A lot of people will argue over sequels, trying to decide which is better. In this case, they're equal.  They are both worthless wastes of time and money.We come back to the same group of morons we watched in the first movie, only to see that graduating High School has somehow made them stupider.  I mean, glueing your hand to your dick is unfunny enough, but managing to wander outside, naked in this condition?  Come on.  I can't believe Hollywood has the nerve to put this in theaters.  I also can't believe how many people find this garbage funny.Other acts of idiocy include breaking into a house, and mistaking urine for champagne.  And everyone wonders why this country seems to be falling apart.

I don't think this movie would work, if you haven't seen the first. It relies too much on characters and story from the first encounter set one year earlier. This said it is a great sequel that simply picks up where the last film left off, it retains all the characters from the first film and places them in equally embarrassing and hilarious situations.Slick, funny and entertainingIf you've missed it, then check it out, but see American Pie firstIf you like it then see 'Road Trip' and 'Old School' as well8/10

American Pie 2 reunites the main characters from the first film into another funny go at the "pie". While the first film was plain original, this one is a bit of a rehash, which is to be expected considering the main characters are doing almost exactly what they did in the first film. The only difference is that they are returning from their first year at college instead of graduating high school. Regardless, it's nice to see Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, and especially Seann William Scott as Stifler and of course Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad! If are going to watch this film, watch the original first and then American Wedding immediately after this one. A funny 7 out of 10.

This has to be one of the worst "major" releases in recent memory.  This should have gone straight to video.  I can enjoy gross out humour ala Something About Mary.  I can find redeeming qualities in teen movies like the excellent 10 Things I hate About You.  There was nothing enjoyable or redeemable in this boring and unfunny thud.  (I must admit to chuckling at a couple of technical gaffes though).  This movie can only be enjoyed by people who are on medication, are self medicating, or are suffering from withdrawal symptoms of American Pie.

I'll be first to admit that I hate teen comedies in general and typically frown upon most of them - I didn't even like "There's Something About Mary" too much, although I'm not sure it's really a "teen" film.I own all three "American Pie" films on DVD because they are one of the few teen series whose characters seem real and you actually feel empathy for. They're not awkward characterizations of real people without emotions - the movie takes time setting up their personalities, quirks, etc., and then places them in embarrassing situations. For example, the movie "Swingers." That telephone call Favreau makes is a painful experience for the viewer. Would it have been so painful if we hadn't gotten to know him throughout the movie? "American Pie" is kinda like that. It works well because of the characters. It's crude, yes. It's crass, very. It's sexist, maybe. But that's how guys are. It doesn't exploit these elements as many teen sex comedies do - some are moderately entertaining (like the Johnny Depp film "Private Resort") but unbelievable and basically just lots of skin. "American Pie" is better, one of the best of its genre.Everyone seems to hate the first sequel, which was released in 2001, a couple years after the original. Jim (Biggs) returns from college and hangs out for the summer at a beach house with his best pals. But with Stiffler (Seann William Scott) there, it's not too easy because they soon end up in more embarrassing situations.This movie is very similar to the original and normally I have a problem with this. Basically all the scenes are "updates" on scenes that existed in the original. E.g. the lesbian strip over the walkie-talkies, the incident with the glue, the whole thing with Stiffler's mom and Finch.Nevertheless it is effective, entertaining and funny. The characters are given more room to develop and believe it or not, I think I like this better than the first film. (The third is probably my favorite, if only for the focus on Stiffler and the introduction of Fred Willard, one of the great character actors of our time.) "American Pie 2" is somewhat recycled and some people may find it one of those "pointless" sequels, but I liked it, and this is coming from a guy who typically loathes these films - so considering I'm giving this seven stars, that says quite a lot. Either I'm out of my mind or there's something about these films that's just more accessible and likable than others in their genre.

I saw the movie in theaters and laughed out loud.  Now, I rented the DVD. I can't say I got as many laughs as the first time, though, and I started to notice more flaws.  At first I thought this movie was better than the original.  Now I'm not sure.  They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale.The two films movie at a similar rhythm.  In the original, we opened with Jim's Dad walking in on him while masturbating.  In the sequel, he walks in on him while he's having sex, only it's taken to the next level with the girlfriend's parents walking in as well.  And we have the keg party, with a Steadicam shot following Stiffler around, who yet again gets into a mishap with bodily fluids.  And of course, in homage of the famous Nadia scene from the original, we have the guys walking in on two lesbians.
The laughs are still there, and there are some genuinely funny moments.  I don't want to give them away, though the previews and some of the other reviewers probably already did.The cast still got it.  Eugene Levy steals the show yet again as Jim's Dad. I do have to say, Stiffler's character got a little too obnoxious at times. It's often funny to hear his foul-mouthed insults, but by the hundredth time you hear him use the word "f**kface" it gets kinda old.
I'm always going to hold the "American Pie" movies several notches above the standard gross-out teen comedies, because they have zest and originality. Not to mention they're done in a professional manner.  The gags are as intelligent as they are crude, and delivered with exquisite timing.  And to top it off, it's a heartfelt film that is not literally all about getting laid.  I thought the original had more heart to it, but the sequel also has its heart in the right place.The music is great.  The soundtrack is full of really cool songs, including "Smooth Criminal" by Alien Ant Farm.  And be sure to check out the unrated DVD special edition.  The commentary is cool and--unlike with the first "American Pie" unrated edition--there is some bonus footage worth checking out.  The lesbian scene is extended significantly.  In the theatrical version, there was only a brief nudity, but you get to see much more in this version.I'm still not sure if I would consider this movie better than the first, but it is one sequel that lives up to the original--and that's saying a lot!My score:  7 (out of 10)

Raunch used to be so simple! You'd go see Porky's, you knew you were gonna see some T&A. Oh, and maybe a small heartfelt lesson about how people are generally good, even those who are different from us, as long as we have the same goal of getting laid in mind. Those were such wonderful days! Now, everyone's more jaded, even (especially) the kids. You show a kid the shower scene from Porky's, and he'll love it, but I bet after the first few viewings it won't be as much fun. Kids need something new all the time. Now, American Pie is an R-rated film, so at least the intended audience isn't the teen crowd, exactly, but then neither was Porky's (or any of its knock offs). The cast from the original American Pie is reunited. The time is now one year later, and the gang's home from college for the summer. Jim (Jason Biggs) still has his sexual hang-ups. Remember Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), the band-camp girl? Jim went to the prom with her, and she didn't talk to him after that. But don't worry, she's at band camp again and figures prominently in this movie. It seems Nadia, the exchange student whose escapades with Jim made the Internet, is back in the country and is ready to hook up with our hapless lead character. What to do! Jim still has no experience. The guys try to help him out by renting a lakeside cottage for the summer. Meanwhile, Stifler's (Seann William Scott) still trying to hump everything in sight; Oz (Chris Klein) is remaining celibate while his girlfriend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in France; Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still lusting after the legendary mother of Stifler, after their much-talked-about union at the party in the first movie; and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is aching after his breakup with Vicky (Tara Reid). There have been no drastic character changes, either; everyone's as you'd expect after a year of college. Which means, of course, that all the guys are hornier than a sex addict in a penny whorehouse. But that's what drives raunch comedies - the testosterone of single-minded males.   As in real life, although the males in the movie have grown up, they still think like high school kids. (And someday this nubile cast will learn that that particular characteristic never really leaves the male of the species!) But while the theme of the movie is sex, sex, and sex, hidden under the layer of bombast and teenage oversexdrive is a theme of tenderness and fallibility. When kids graduate high school, they think they know it all. "Bring life on!" they chortle with glee. "We know it all!" But there's a certain vulnerability that everyone feels at some point, and that's the issue of sexual conduct for the first time. And here's where American Pie 2 deviates from other raunch films. In those yesteryear movies, there was always tremendous pressure for one schlub to get lucky once and for all. I'm talking huge peer pressure! But in this movie, while all of Jim's friends want him to get laid, they never, ever make him feel like he's below average or beneath them because he's not experienced what they have. And that, to me, makes this a very special movie - although, rest assured, it's still as raunchy as the first one.   In addition, the ending is so unlike those earlier raunchfests that you actually sit there and admire the screenwriters for not, for once, pandering to the least common denominator.   But hold on! Don't look at me like that! You're thinking that if it has good intentions and good messages, how much fun could it really be? Trust me, if you enjoyed the pastry coitus in the first movie, you'll get a kick out of Jim's misadventures in this one, too. The writing is way above par for movies in this genre, and the cast is both lovely to look at more than capable in their deliveries and actions.

I liked this movie and got a lot of laughs out of it. It wasn't as good as the original, but then again, most sequels aren't.   This movie is basically several funny skits all thrown together.  And some of the jokes are just repeats from the original, but others are new. So, that's why this comedy works.
But, why did they even bring the girls back from the original except for Michelle.  Vicky, Nadia, Heather, Jessica added nothing to this movie. Each one of them only had a couple of lines.  The guys are what makes it work. Jim and Stifler are the funniest of them all.  And Jim's dad is great too.
FINAL VERDICT: It's funny. It's raunchy. Its got lesbian and porn scenes. What more could you ask for from a comedy!

Sure the old saying is that sequel can never measure up its predecessor can be held true to this sequel of the 'American Pie" sequel with the same characters and roughly the same jokes and gags repeat themselves which means that the surprises are gone and the shocks are not as fresh. When Stifler's (Seann William Scott) mom (Jennifer Coolidge) showed up it was heaven send. In "American Pie" her presence has been reduced as an inside joke. In the first film Jim (Jason Biggs) and Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) are oblivious in that they were having sex while being streamed on the Internet. In the sequel, strangers caught onto a sex scene by way of CB radios.In spite of the eat, sleep, conquer, repeat scenario we get in "American Pie 2", it's still an enjoyable raunchy comedy in which the characters are the perfect comic archetypes and they all play their respected roles like I would've expected in a movie like this. Aside from the raunchy comedy elements with a plethora of sexual innuendo used for humour, the characters depicted here offer sympathy due to their overall likable nature. It's great that Eugene Levy is back as the world's most level-headed father of Jim who always has his son's back no matter what sticky situation he's in (pun intended). There are so many memorable scenes that you wish you were part of the action and taking part in the gang's many sexual misadventures just for the thrills.It was refreshing that the gang was back for the second serving of pie. Not because they were all obligated to return due to their contractual stances, but simply because they all enjoyed the first outing and because the film needed a bit of continuation of closure to some of the subplots. So after a year of graduating from high school, the gang just finished a year of college so they decide to get a sigh of relief by spending their summer hiatus partying at a summer cottage by the lake in Grand. Haven, Michigan.We can take a great deal of empathy for Jim due to the many disasters he encountered in his last outing. Getting his sex scenes exploited on the Internet, his fist sexual encounter was one major miscalculation after another, and his prom was a night he'll never forget, though he wished he would. When he gets the news that Nadia is returning for the summer, he hires Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) to offer him some types on getting proper intercourse with her. Sure she might be a little wacky at times, but has a good heart and takes it upon herself to teach him the basics.The biggest flaw was that the most fleshed out scene is not the most interesting. It involves the gang imprisoned in the cottage and are now subservient by the.two occupants of the house who may or may not be lesbians, though the gang thinks they are. The girls (Denise Faye and Lisa Arturo) blackmail the boys by putting on show for them if the guys engage in uncompromising activities in exchange to watch them engage in sexual activity. There are some funny moments, but this scene wears out its welcome progressively. There's some poor taste in humour when Jim enters band camp pretending that he's a special needs trombone player.Even though with the exception of Michelle, the female characters play smaller roles than their male co-stars, they're not just vulnerable sex kittens used as trophy prizes for the guys. They have just as much raunchiness too like Heather (Mena Suvari) gets her boyfriend, Oz (Chris Klein) to engage in phone sex while she's studying overseas in Spain. Meanwhile Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and ex-girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) lie to each other about the myriad of sex partners they encountered while in college. Sure after this movie, they launched two more installments after this one, with the gang now married with kids and then almost a decade later, they reunited for a reunion. And through the wrinkle, receding hairlines, and progressively growing grey hairs, the one thing that had never changed all those years, their hunger for sex. As long as the dessert is not served with a slice of pie.

The first film was a big box office hit and a highly successful teen movie, and many of the fans must have been thrilled that every member of the cast of the original were coming back for a sequel, from director J.B. Rogers (Say It Isn't So). Basically Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have all returned to their hometown in East Great Falls, Michigan after finishing their first year of college, and naturally they attend the party hosted by still oversexed Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott), but this is cut short by the police. With nowhere to party because of the police Kevin finds out that there is a beach house in Grand Harbor, Michigan, so the four friends, plus Stifler for rent, pack their bags and make themselves comfortable, finding work as painters and decorators to pay the rent and prepare for the big party. Kevin is feeling awkward with ex-girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) back in town and he feels may want to get back with her. Oz is missing girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari) who is away in Spain and they keep their relationship going with attempted phone sex. Finch have discovered the sexual art of Tantra to keep in his desires as he waits patiently for the opportunity to possibly get with his goddess, Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). Jim is worried because Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) will be returning, and he feels his lack of sexual experience will put her off, so he seeks sex tips and advice from his prom date Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan). Stifler is fascinated to see that the painted house owners Danielle (Denise Faye) and Amber (Lisa Arturo) may be lesbians, and with Jim and Finch he breaks in to find his proof, and they return and catch them they decide to mess with the boys, giving them homosexual acts in exchange for them doing it, e.g. the girls kiss if the boys kiss, and for a while they go with it. Jim's confidence problems only get worse when Stifler provides him lubricant, and distracted by pornography he unintentionally grabs super glue he used earlier to masturbate, and he ends up with his hand glued to his penis, the other to the porn video, at hospital, supported by his Dad (Eugene Levy) he is told there will be swelling for a while, and he is shocked to see Nadia arriving early. While preparations for the big party get underway, Jim has Michelle pretend to be his girlfriend until everything is ready and he has all the tips he needs, and with his penis back to normal they fake breaking up on the day of the party. So the party gets underway, Kevin is crushed Vicky has a boyfriend, Finch disappointed earlier that his goddess was not coming spends his time talking philosophically to various women, Oz has Heather surprise him having taken an early flight, and Jim lets Nadia down saying that he realises he has feelings for Michelle. The party is a big success, all the guests drinking and dancing with joy, with Jim and Michelle becoming boyfriend-girlfriend, Kevin and Vicky happy as friends, Oz and Heather still happy together, and Stifler ecstatic in bed with Danielle and Amber who turned out to be bisexual, even Chuck 'The Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) scoring with Nadia. The end sees the boys packed and ready to go home, promising that if they can they will do the same again every summer, and Finch is happy to say Stifler's Mom, real name Janine, pop by and pick him up to go and have sex again. Also starring Natasha Lyonne as Jessica, Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom, Justin Isfeld as Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1, John Cho as John - 'MILF' Guy #2, Eli Marienthal as Stifler's Brother, Casey Affleck as Tom Myers, Joelle Carter as Natalie, Bean's Larry Drake as Natalie's Dad, Lee Garlington as Natalie's Mom and Austin Powers' Kevin Cooney as Doctor. The cast are still as likable as ever, Biggs more foolish than before, Thomas weirder with his holding in of an orgasm, Scott much more foul-mouthed and sex-obsessed, and Levy in his moments still amusing and embarrassing. The story is simple, just teens getting back together to drink a lot, have sex and party hard, but the slapstick and dialogue jokes still work when they need to, the highlights are Stifler being peed on, the terrible trumpet playing, the phone sex scene, the lesbian fun and the super gluing, it is a fun comedy. Good!

I love revisiting movies I haven't seen in years, as it's like a whole new experience. I have forgotten so much about this movie, but remembered enough to have an old friend feeling when watching. Picks up the summer after their first year of college and they guys, along with Stifler, get a lake house to have one big huge Summer end party. All sorts of hijinks, raunchy sexcapades, and fantastic heartfelt humor fill this sequel. Great movie, full of laughs, and an absolute must for anyone who likes the first, or just like to laugh in general.
This movie is almost true to life as the expectation of high school friends after the first year of college.

American Pie 2 (2001, Dir. James B. Rogers) The whole gang are back and shows that they are as close as ever. They decide to get even closer, by spending the summer together at a beach house. They decide to hold the biggest party ever to be seen, even if the preparation doesn't always go to plan. Especially when Stifler, Finch and Jim become more close to each other than they ever want to be and when Jim mistakes super glue for lubricant.When the 'American Pie' gang returns, everyone knows that they will be expecting gross out humour and wild characters, and this movie doesn't disappoint. All the wonderful characters are back, including Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad, who steals every scene he is in. Stifler is his usual self and Finch is more entertaining this time. A lot of the female side of cast have a reduced role in this movie. Alyson Hannigan's role is expanded, whilst the others only appear in a few scenes. The jokes again are well written, but like the first film, are not the most cleanest of jokes. If you saw the first movie, then you would know what kind of adult material is found in this film. Although, the film holds up well alongside it's predecessor, it had a slight decrease in the comedy. Still, it's a fun and entertaining movie to watch."The force is strong with that one." - Stifler (Seann William Scott)

Good as the first one American Pie this sequel in my opinion is the best party sequel about college guys ever. This was my favorite movie of the first two movies in high school at the time. I was in senior year before I transher to other school. This in my opinion is good as the first one. All the gangs are back and they decied to make their own party since Stifler party was busted by cops. Great comedy, sexy, friendship, intelligent and smart. It is my third favorite in the "American Pie" franchise.American Pie 2 pick's off where the first one left off it is been one year since the guys loose their virginty and they attendet collage. Some couples are together some broke up. The first year of college is over for Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Reuniting back in East Great Falls to trade stories about sexual escapades and university life, the boys find themselves having to deal with the women (Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan, Mena Suvari, and Shannon Elizabeth) they rudely left behind. Determined to make the most out of the promising summer, the guys, along with their revolting but affluent friend Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), decide to rent a beach house to help sort out their confused, combustible lives. Running into mischievous lesbians, masturbation sessions stymied by Krazy Glue, the wonders of band camp, Jim's Dad (the invaluable Eugene Levy), Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge), and parties galore, the four young men learn valuable life lessons as they awkwardly navigate all the tomfoolery of their summer break.This movie is about party on the beach house and the boys decide to make one of the best summer ever. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Vicky (Tara Reid) are no longer together weird, I did not like that. Jim (Jason Biggs) is still deeply in love with Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), but asks Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) the band geek to help him out, so he could get better in sex. Oz (Chris Klein) and Heather (Mena Suvari) are still together but they are MILES seperated because Heather goes to study to Europe. Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still horny about Stifler's mom MILF (Jennifer Coolidge). Stifler (Seann William Scott) is still a dick and he is brother Matt (Eli Marienthal) is funny.The film is outrages laughable I have the VHS home and I do have to Blu-ray disc which contains Unrated version of the movie diffrent from the teacrical cut I used to had. The movie has jokes like Jim glues him self, I really like Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) defending his son after a older woman attacks JIm about his sex orientation, when he had a VHS tape glue on his hand. I would stick up for my son that way too. Shannon Elizabeth is still gorgeous in this movie she is great and sexy as Nadia. Gorgeous Tara Reid is awesome in this movie. Mena Suvari is hot. Sherminator (Chfris Owen) is back in this movie and he lands up with Nadia funny. We have two lesbians in this movie who force the boys to jerk off Stifler's private part. Denise Fey and Lisa Arturo were great as Danielle and Amber as two lesbians.Love the soundtracks: Blind Spot by Transmatic, Want You Bad by The Ofspring, Blink 182 - Every Time I Look For You, Good For a Woman by Alien ant farm-smooth criminal and more songs. James B. Rogers directed well this sequel so it is one of the best comedy's of 2000's. They don't make em like this anymore. My third favorite "American Pie" movie.

The story is none existent but there was never surposed to be one. Group of guys that want to have sex end of story. The first one was good but this one is just as funny.I was the right age in 2001 for this movie so it will always hold a special place in my heart. If you want a laugh, some blink 182 / sum 41 tunes in the background then watch it.It's not the greatest film ever made but it's getting a 7/10 for laughs and the related subject in every boys life growing up.Their all on Now TV binge watch them all, you wont be disappointed.

First of all, this is (of course) a film for people who want to laugh (mainly at others screwing up). Especially Jim (Jason Biggs) seems to get himself in the most embarrassing situations over and over again. But there are other funny moments too, with the Stifmeister (Sean William Scott), Ozzy (Chris Klein), Kev (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finchy (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Mainly the film is about what moves people my age and any other age most, the opposite sex. All that obsessing and wondering about the other (does he / she like me, do I love him / her?) is really greatly portrayed and realistic. Of course the people in the film are all not too shabby looking and there are some sick and perverted moments in the film, but you really have to look at the bigger picture. You have to look past the objectification of women, the booze and the parties. You have to look past that 'every guy's 'perfect summer' and see that this film is not about sex, it is not about being sexy and cool. This film is about being whoever you are, being true to yourself and your friends, but most of all it is about love. I mean the latter thing may not be true for all characters in the film (e.g. Steve Stifler), but it sure concerns the 'main characters' life (Jimbo's life). The rest of the film is however pure fun and freedom, that any college student hopes to get. I sure hope my first summer of being in college will rock like that. Can't wait to see the sequel. And again, I do not think I have to force someone to make a sequel.8 out of 10Note: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time. Apologies for any offence caused. I was young and stupid at the time, thinking I was being 'cool'.

Well here we are, back for more of the same antics we got in American Pie. There may be a sense we've seen this all before but somehow American Pie 2 really works. All the characters we know and love (or hate) from the original are back and they're constantly being placed into outrageous situations which will inspire gut-busting laughs. Even though we're going back over much of the same territory, the sequel is more consistently and explosively funny than the original. What could have easily been a pointless, unnecessary sequel actually manages to be something fresh, funny and appealing.As with the original the Jason Biggs character of Jim is the glue holding the film together. Everything revolves around him in one way or another. Where in the original film each of the main male characters came with his own romantic storyline this time around Jim takes center stage. Most of the female characters have been shunted to the sidelines here with Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne being mere bit players. Their absence doesn't hurt at all and may actually help by making the story more focused. This one's all about the boys with Jim and friends renting a summer home following their first year of college. Back for more hilarity are Chris Klein as Oz, Eddie Kaye Thomas as the increasingly bizarre Finch and Thomas Ian Nicholas as the comparatively dull Kevin. And even though none of the others like him the script finds a way to contrive to get Seann William Scott's juvenile, vulgar, obnoxious Stifler tossed into the mix. Where the other guys might go to the edge of what is appropriate Stifler is always willing to go careening over the edge and his antics are a hoot.If you thought nothing could be more embarrassing than what happened to Jim in the original film, just wait. And along to heighten the embarrassment is Jim's father, played wonderfully by Eugene Levy, who in trying to help inevitably just makes things worse. And the one female from the original who actually has a major role here, Alysson Hannigan as Michelle, also does a great job. Oh, the wacky things that go on at band camp. With a slew of familiar characters moving from one hilarious situation to the next, all backed by a winning soundtrack, American Pie 2 succeeds in equaling and even surpassing the original.

I loved the original film and had pretty high expectations going into this one. While I enjoyed it all the way through, something just felt off, and the lesbian scene felt unnecesary. The characters stayed the same for the most part and I ain't complaining, I loved how relatable they were from the first one and they felt real, so I didn't mind how this was a 'characters get into weird scenarios the movie'. The refrences were nice I guess and the soundtrack too..I haven't got much to say.

Caution: spoilers.Before I begin, a few points about taste and suitability. Firstly, this film is crude, childish, and by many people's standards obscene: it features bare breasts, swearing and numerous attempts at pre-marital sex. Secondly, if you were expecting Citizen Kane, they you have bought the wrong video. Direction and cinematography are not the main aims of this work of art. Humour, however, is.And it is funny. Puerile, base, vulgar and unkind, but funny. Characters get things jammed up their bottoms, glue hands to genitals, and more. It is like a Donald McGill seaside postcard, enlarged and moved to America.The plot is simple: five friends sit in a beach-house planning a party, each with his own girl problems to solve come party time. Next door are two pretty, tactile ladies who might be lesbians. Comedy ensues.The film divides itself between our hero, Jim, preparing for the arrival of a Russian girl who he believes to be a "sure thing", and the others in the house. There are two serious subplots: one of the friends has a girlfriend who lives far away, and another is trying to get back with his ex.Much of the comedy relies on whether you can stand the characters and stomach what happens to them. The odious Stifler, for instance, seems too much a bully to be likable, and the scenes where he is humiliated gain something from this. Jim, on the other hand, is basically decent, and whilst laughable, we want him to succeed.I found the two serious subplots of little interest: I am older than the ideal age-group, and they don't really seem very applicable to me now. Were I 18, they might well do, although they do weigh the comedy down. Also, perhaps deliberately, the character chasing his ex appears simply wretched rather than likable. Still, viewers may learn something.Which brings me onto the fact that this film is, basically, moral. Forget the sex and farting jokes: at base, the film is broadly correct about the way men and women behave, and falls on the side of decency. The central relationship between Jim and Michelle (an excellent turn from Alyson Hannigan, at once weird, funny and sympathetic) is sweetness with a thin veneer of crudity, and shows the real heart of the film. Excellent also is Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad, embarrassing and hilarious, but protective and sincere. For silly, throwaway entertainment, this scores highly. If you are a vicar or Pauline Kael, don't bother, but if you are looking for a film that is simple fun, this does well. The characters and subplots make it uneven - I often ended up waiting for the action to switch to better characters - but there are moments of real hilarity so long as you can tolerate the rudeness that comes with them. This film will inevitably offend and disgust more prudish viewers, but for someone willing to watch silly vulgarity without throwing all moral sense to the wind, it is one of the classics of its type. Besides, morality is what you make it. To my mind, compared to the gross, gloating, sado-masochistic excess of The Passion of The Christ, it seems wholesome indeed.

I liked this movie and got a bunch of laughs out of it. I couldn't say it was as good as the original, most sequels aren't. This movie is basically several funny skits all thrown together. And some of the jokes are just repeats from the original student life, but others are new. It works.But, why did they even study the girls back from the original except for Michelle. Vicky, Nadia, Heather, Jessica added nothing to learn something new. Each one of them only had a couple of lines as we learn it in school. No special things. The scholars are what makes it work. Jim and Stifler are the funniest of them all. And Jim's dad is awesome.FINAL VERDICT: It's funny. It's raunchy. To get and learn more it can work as it definitely helps you to get more knowledge about not ideal adult and college life.

Considering how great the first one was, I'm a little disappointed over this movie. It just seemed like they pretty much remade the first, just taking it a little further, making it more gross and more extreme, which may work for some fans of the first, but I honestly enjoyed the realness and laid-back feeling of the first far more than the gross scenes and stereotypes. Now, the stereotypes and the gross scenes are multiplied, to a point where it just gets a little tiresome. The apparent lack of any real original ideas, rather than just rehashes of the first, was a bit annoying too. But, all in all, it's an OK sequel, and a reasonably good teen comedy. The plot is OK, but it just seems too much like it was made up just in order to make a sequel to the first. The characters are a little too stereotypical, and not as well-written and real as they were the in first one. The humor is more or less the same, too much the same, in fact, as many of the jokes are just reused from the same formula as the first, like several of the scenes. Overall, the movie is not as good as the first, but it's OK. It's worth watching, if you want to see the characters again. I recommend this to fans of the first, and fans of teen comedies in general. 7/10

The five "lovable" morons from "American Pie" are back.  This movie is about their first summer after freshman year in college.  They all get together and rent a beautiful cottage to throw parties and have sex.  Naturally supposedly hilarious sexual hijinks occur.  I'm no fan of the first film (I thought it was pretty sick and I don't find sexual humiliation funny), but this is actually better.  The humor is toned down (although Jason Biggs' character gets in some pretty sick situations) and I admit I laughed out loud a few times.  It looks better than the first film and the performances are slightly (only slightly) better.  Unfortunately the film is incredibly sexist (no shock there) and there's an ugly homophobic sequence.  Still, I'd lie if I said I didn't enjoy myself.  It's also kind of admirable for a sequel to actually tone down its raunchiness instead of trying to outdo the original.  And Alyson Hannigan is absolutely wonderful (again) in this film. She was one of the sole saving graces in the first and is again.  As for the guys--Jason Biggs still can't act and seems destined to make a career out of being humiliated; Seann William Scott is absolutely appalling and unfunny; Chris Klein is given the thankless good guy role but pulls it off; Thomas Ian Nicholas hardly registers and Eddie Kaye Thomas actually is a worse actor than Biggs and very annoying.  So, if you like the first one you'll probably love this.

A slightly more over the top and over glamorous sequel to the pie humping original. Pie 2 is still packed with great one liners and jokes. There are few better teen comedies than the American Pie series.

American Pie 2 is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and my personal favorite from the series. Not only does it deliver great comedy, but also showcases the evolution of the characters and how they face their first summer back from college. This is something that I think resonates with a lot of people and it was one of the reasons why I loved it. So 1 year later, we see Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch & Stifler get back to hanging out and looking to spend the perfect summer by partying their asses off. For this they will have to move to the lakeside and rent a beach house in order to end their holidays with a memorable farewell party. Friendships will be tested, realizations will arise, as well as love, and in the end we get to find out if these group's bond was made stronger from the experience. For starters, this movie once again delivers in its trademark raunchiness with hilarious moments mainly involving Jim, but also Stifler. Storywise, we see the maturity most of these characters have garnered. I think the one that truly sees this in the best way is Kevin, as he is still clinging on to his old life, trying to be with Vicki and hanging out with his group. But Vicki only wants to be friends, and so Kevin learns that he must not live in the past, while also accepting the promising future he has. For me American Pie 2 is a great sequel to an already great movie. In fact, for me, it eclipses the original and makes for an even better experience. It's funny, disgusting and most of all entertaining in every aspect. Rating: 10/10

American pie 2 succeeds because all the soppy, sentimental slop from the first is absent. But one of the main problems with this film is that all the ridiculous, poorly developed character who serve as nothing but filler are still very much in place,. I mean, what on earth is Nadia doing in this film? She was a one dimensional character to begin with, and the ringed every possible gag from her already, so why bother to include her in the movie? A lot of the film is filled with problems like that, but at the end of the day it has enough funny bits still included to actually be very funny! The scene where the two girls make the guys kiss is the best in this average film!

A lot of people will argue over sequels, trying to decide which is better. In this case, they're equal.  They are both worthless wastes of time and money.We come back to the same group of morons we watched in the first movie, only to see that graduating High School has somehow made them stupider.  I mean, glueing your hand to your dick is unfunny enough, but managing to wander outside, naked in this condition?  Come on.  I can't believe Hollywood has the nerve to put this in theaters.  I also can't believe how many people find this garbage funny.Other acts of idiocy include breaking into a house, and mistaking urine for champagne.  And everyone wonders why this country seems to be falling apart.

I don't think this movie would work, if you haven't seen the first. It relies too much on characters and story from the first encounter set one year earlier. This said it is a great sequel that simply picks up where the last film left off, it retains all the characters from the first film and places them in equally embarrassing and hilarious situations.Slick, funny and entertainingIf you've missed it, then check it out, but see American Pie firstIf you like it then see 'Road Trip' and 'Old School' as well8/10

American Pie can't shake a stick at at the original, the original was one of my favorite films of all time, and this one is just funny, and kinda sweet. The story is very good, but also very similar to the original. The screenplay is good, the dialogue is great, as are the jokes, but the story is still very similar to the original and that could have been changed. The acting is great, just as good as the original. This is one of the best acted stupid comedies ever. The direction is good, but I really wish the directors from the original had come back. This director is still pretty good. The visual effects are good, some of the effects look very good, some very fake, but that could be on a way to get more jokes, I laughed at them. Not as good as the first, but still worth your time.

This has to be one of the worst "major" releases in recent memory.  This should have gone straight to video.  I can enjoy gross out humour ala Something About Mary.  I can find redeeming qualities in teen movies like the excellent 10 Things I hate About You.  There was nothing enjoyable or redeemable in this boring and unfunny thud.  (I must admit to chuckling at a couple of technical gaffes though).  This movie can only be enjoyed by people who are on medication, are self medicating, or are suffering from withdrawal symptoms of American Pie.
