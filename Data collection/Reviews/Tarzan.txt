From its dramatic opening sequence, to its jubilant, high-five finale, Disney's "Tarzan" is, without question, a very entertaining re-telling of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tale of a helpless, human baby reared to adulthood, in the jungle, by a band of gorillas.Featuring some excellent action sequences (mixed generously with moments of slapstick comedy and the excitement of adventure), 1999's "Tarzan" certainly turned out to be a mighty fine example of first-rate story-telling that actually tugged on this viewer's heartstrings, occasionally.In this animated feature film, the lean and athletic Tarzan (as the story's hero) comes across as being a truly likable and endearing character.Punctuated by songs (which seemed a bit out of place) from pop star, Phil Collins, "Tarzan" is still a delightful movie-experience that can definitely be enjoyed by all ages, young and old.

Tarzan (1999) - is the final movie in the Disney Renaissance and it certainly was a great note to leave on. The story is very basic and easy to follow but they allow so much to happen when it comes to character development and showing off the incredible surroundings of the jungle. All the characters are very memorable and I especially love the way they work Tarzan and Jane's relationship. I love how each of them work of each other and how Jane helps Tarzan understand the ways of the human life. The gorillas also have their moments of tenderness and I do like how each of their views of Tarzan are well understandable. I kinda will admit that the villain is sort of weak but he still acts as a major threat to Tarzan even though it's kinda obvious how Disney is hiding the fact that he's really a villain and not a good guy. The way they work the animation is absolutely incredible. it is just mind blowing and how they manage to combine hand-drawn animation with CGI effects. It makes the look of the jungle feel so immersive and lifelike. The action scenes definitely are proof of how great the animation is and it moves at such a fast and steady pace. it's probably some of the most action pack stuff I've ever seen in a hand drawn film. The overall music score is great for setting the mood and any type of scene. Whether there's a heartfelt scene or an action-packed sequence, the music is always there to accompany whatever is happening on screen. Phil Collins wrote and performed a few songs for the movie and I think all of them are heartfelt and catchy. They are all greatly separated from one another and they play their part whenever the moment is right. I love this movie for a lot of reasons but overall, it's just an outstanding piece of magic to behold.

Tarzan is considered to be the final film of the 'Disney Renaissance'. It's hard to argue with that, as it was the studios last big box office hit and widely acclaimed film for a number of years. It is also a story that is perfectly tailored to Disney's style given its strong underlying themes and emotive characters. Importantly it understands the key aspects within the story as it provides a lot of feeling and intrigue to what is a straight-forward story. Tarzan's parents are killed in the jungle, he is raised by apes and he later battles the feelings that he doesn't belong with them. It is rather bare when you look at it like that, but Disney knows that what is important is seeing these characters grow and change through the challenges put in their way. Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn) himself is near perfect. He's kind, he's curious, he's smart, but he is also very much human and makes mistakes in realising that. He is someone that we can get behind and care about. Seeing him grow throughout the film and become more ape- like whilst becoming less human is really engaging. You do feel for him and connect with his struggle of getting his adoptive father to accept him as his own. I wasn't a fan of the stuff with the young Tarzan, but once he gets older the story keeps on becoming more interesting as we see Tarzan questioning who he is.The other characters are good too. Jane is just fantastic. She takes such joy from the little details, has plenty of funny moments and Minnie Driver does a superb job. Plus I found the romance between her and Tarzan very believable, more than I can say for many Disney efforts. Kala (Glenn Close) is nicely sympathetic and her bond with Tarzan is well developed, while Karchak has legitimate reasons for his hostility and Lance Henriksen is excellent as always. Clayton is a slightly weak villain and another who is just after money (which is a bit of a cop-out), but Brian Blessed's booming voice gives the character something of an edge. The professor (Nigel Hawthorne) gets some funny lines too. The animation is just spectacular. To see Tarzan effectively surf across the trees and vines is wonderful to see. What impresses me is how well the animation flows because at times it moves so quickly, especially in those surfing scenes. The jungle setting lends itself to some creative visuals too. There's some fabulous action sequences too that are always full of energy and really suspenseful, especially with the climax. The story is told relatively serious which is a suitable for a story like this. The comic relief can feel out of place but it is mostly kept to a minimum and most of the humour simply comes from the situations.The music is simply brilliant. I'm not a big fan of Phil Collins, but the songs here are really good songs and the lyrics perfectly convey the emotions that Tarzan is going through like they should. 'Two Worlds' and 'Strangers Like Me' are especially good. They might get in the way for some, but for me they were really impressive and never felt out of place. Of course the film isn't without flaws. Though Tarzan's dilemma is addressed, I would have liked to see the film look deeper into his problems. I also found characters like Terk (Rosie O'Donnell) rather annoying and not really needed. Plus I wish the cheetah that killed Tarzan's parents was given more of a story, he could have been a great obstacle for Tarzan to overcome given the personal history.Tarzan is a very impressive piece from Disney and it knows exactly where to keep its focus. It crafts a character that the audience cares about and puts him through a journey that we want to see the outcome of. I enjoyed how serious the story was kept and how the relationships between the characters felt real. It isn't perfect and stumbles at times, but its heart is always in the right place and when it works it is frequently brilliant. I like the characters, the animation is just great and the music is really effective. Tarzan is a worthy take on a well-known story, frequently striking a chord and doing what Disney do best.

A family is shipwrecked and stranded in the jungle. Sabor the leopard kills the parents and Kala the gorilla rescues the baby. Despite leader Kerchak's disapproval, Kala raises the baby naming him Tarzan. Brash gorilla Terk befriends him and they meet fearful elephant Tantor. When Sabor attacks, Tarzan saves Kerchak and the group with his spear. Professor Porter and his daughter Jane are studying the gorillas led by their hunter guide Clayton. Jane is chased by a pack of baboons and Tarzan rescues her. Tarzan becomes torn between the jungle and going with Jane to England.The animation is terrific and very energetic. Tarzan swinging in the trees is exciting. The traditional tale is a bit stale and I don't think the montage sequences are that compelling. The Phil Collins music may not be a great fit for a Disney kids movie. Nevertheless this is a good animated movie for the whole family. It has enough excitement and maintains the interest of the audience.

Based on the famous series of novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 – March 19, 1950), Disney has come up with a pretty entertaining adaptation of the beloved literary character.The first thing I must talk about is the animation. Disney has perfectly blended classic animation with computer animation. The computer animation enhances the classic animation with movement drawings couldn't do. In many scenes, "Tarzan" (child voiced by Alex D. Lintz; adult voiced by Tony Goldwyn) is sliding on large tree branches rapidly. In the classic animation style, they would not have been successful in "following" "Tarzan" through the trees as well as they could with computer animation due to the rapid movement.There are very few dark colors in the scenery. In fact, the only dark colors were used for the gorillas, shadowing and human hair. Most of the colors are light gray, lots of green (it is in a jungle) and other brighter colors.There are some pretty good performances in this film. However, none really stood out in my opinion. I was not that impressed with some supporting characters, as they had little screen time and thus had no time to develop. Rosie O'Donnell was a delight as "Terk," who was "Tarzan's" best gorilla friend.If you ask me, they really missed the mark to make a memorable villain in this film. They had two chances, but killed one, and just did a horrible job making a human villain.As for music, which Disney is known for, there isn't a lot performed on screen by characters like in previous movies. In fact, characters burst into two songs. The rest of the soundtrack is done mainly by Grammy and Academy Award-winning Phil Collins. The songs by Collins is easily a lot more memorable than the rest of the musical score. In fact, all I really can remember is Collins songs. However, the Collins songs, which he wrote and performed, is not as memorable as some of the classic songs Disney is known for. Therefore, if you hear the songs by Collins, you won't be catching yourself singing these tunes, nor will you think of the movie when you hear the songs. The songs did fit well into scenes though.The movie is well paced, however I did think the story was really rushed due to the 89 minute length of the film. They really rushed the part where "Jane" (voiced by Minnie Driver) and the team she was with tried to bring "Tarzan" back to civilization with some of the animal characters as prizes. They also did a pretty good job with the famed relationship between "Jane" and Tarzan. If this movie was a little longer, they really could have worked on many scenes, character development and the relationships between the characters. After seeing this movie, I am almost certain they made the animated television series based on this movie to better explore the relationships in the movie.If you ask me, this is almost a Disney classic. But, in my opinion, it barely misses the mark to be up there with "Snow White" and others touched by Disney's magic.

Tarzan is officially the final film in the Disney Renaissance, made in a time when CGI movies were becoming the hottest thing since the founding of Disney parody sites on the internet (okay, maybe that didn't happen in 1999, but you should see my point), continuing to be strong at the box office like the films before it. There are a good amount of reasons as to why, such as having some unsettlingly awesome action between Tarzan, Sabor, and Clayton, one of the most horrifying and scarring villain deaths, and plenty of emotion. The sad thing is, most of it is in the prologue and epilogue acts, with Tarzan's childhood (which spawned one of the cartoon universe's most unwarranted sequels) and adolescence being rather ho-hum. There is some humor to lighten it all up, but it once again works about half the time and, wisely, comes during child Tarzan scenes when we know that Tarzan is still puerile. Check it out, but expect to be affected more by the drama and action than the comedy.

Imagine six 50-something and 60-something men and women watching this version of "Tarzan" (Disney, animated)on DVD and at the end, some of them saying "that is the best movie I have ever seen." Well, I can't personally say it was *the best* I've ever seen, but for sheer entertainment there haven't been many better.The story is very familiar to most of us, and this version sticks to the tried and true (!) very well.  The novelty are in the eye-popping Disney animation, the humorous script, and the "delivery" of the lines by the various celebrity voices. I bought the DVD because I want to watch it periodically, and also with my grandchildren as they grow up.The "extras" on the DVD are really fine. Recording of the "Trashing the Camp" music is featured, plus a few other equally interesting features.  The best being a film "short" of the animated Disney feature "Dinosaur" slated for release in May 2000.  I'm going to buy that one too!I gave this movie a solid "9" of "10" for sheer enjoyment.

A different but brilliantly adapted version of Borough's classic novel. From the get go Tarzan will have you wide eyed and waiting to see what will happen next. The opening sequence is one of the most impressive I have ever seen in film. The opening sequence is just so powerful as it shows the contrast of the human family (infant Tarzan with his parents) and the gorilla family living happily before tragedy strikes both families which leads Kala to finding the baby Tarzan. All done without dialog, all done with the great song "Two Worlds" in the background.Changing Tarzan's adoptive family to gorillas worked well because it showed a more gentle side to these great apes, which are often depicted as savage bruits in such films as King Kong and Planet of the apes. Tony Goldwyn did a great job as Tarzan; he hit the right balance of fun loving, relaxed and also emotional when it was required. However, Glen Close gave a soft, angelic voice to Kala that only a mother could have and her bond with both the child and adult Tarzan was at the emotional soul of the film. This was contradicted perfectly by Henriksen's performance as the un-accepting and judgmental ape leader Kurchack. Jane, Tantor, Turk were all great characters that all did well with adding humor at the appropriate times and what I liked about Driver's performance was that she was neither the defiant heroine nor the damsel in distress but rather she was simply a girl who had come to an untamed land and became enchanted with the world of a man she would later fall in love with. I would even go as far as to say that Jane is one of Disney's best female leads.I also give the movie points for the animations, most adaptations would have Tarzan swinging through the trees, but here he actually surfs through the trees.However, I do feel that the villain (voiced by Brian Blessed) was slightly weak in comparison to other characters, Clayton is not very interesting in terms of motivation but I do feel he could have been more unique if he had been made to look younger, I would have preferred to see him have the looks of say John Smith from Pocahontas, he just seemed quite forgettable but held up in the film's final third. I also feel the film would have been more effective if Sabor was given a speaking part. Simply having the leopard growl and roar seemed to make him a brainless carnivore as opposed to an enemy and in my humble opinion Sabor would have been more intimidating if the had a speaking role to match his ferocity.The film's strongest point was it's music and Phil Collins and Mark Mancina joined forces to create one of the greatest soundtracks I have heard in a very long time. With the exception of "Trashing the camp" which was sung by Turk, Collins used his actual voice for all of the songs and tunes such as "Son of Man" or "Strangers like me" or the Oscar winning "You'll be in my heart" will all go down as classics and give the film for being original and not sticking to the traditional musical tone.As one of the final traditionally animated films to be considered a hit, and is probably the greatest depiction of the story of Tarzan ever put on the big screen. An absolute must see.

Tarzan is a very good film indeed, and is without doubt the last great Disney movie. It only has one flaw, that's it, and in comparison to Hercules (weakest Disney of the 90s)that's saying something. The animation is just gorgeous. I have been to Africa, and never have I seen the African Jungle look so beautiful. The songs, performed by Phil Collins mostly, are very pleasant, though I must confess, that I did get annoyed once when my sister played "Two worlds" at loud volume on the computer, for what felt like an eternity. The characters are great, Tarzan is a wonderfully charismatic lead. My favourite character was Jane, thanks to a brilliant characterisation from the underrated Minnie Driver. Terk and Tantor provide great comic relief, and the gorillas provide plenty of quite emotional scenes. The weakest character, was the aforementioned Clayton. Although Brian Blessed voiced him with enthusiasm, Clayton wasn't particularly likable. The main reason why I like this movie as much as I do, is the thoroughly human portrayals of the characters, and it was also the first time in a Disney since Beauty and the Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame when I cried at the very end of the movie. Who would, it's really emotional. Tarzan is a must-see for Disney fans. It's not perfect, but it's miles better than the trash out today. 9/10 Bethany Cox

The world of Tarzan and the world of Jane.Killer soundtrack by Collins,veteran voice cast,wonderful drawing.

I take away the first point partly for killing off the villain (yet again) and partly because the villain was ridiculous in the first place, taking up time that could have been used to expand the usual quick-cut musical montage.Hence the reason for the removal of the second point: having a musical montage take the place of an emotional or important event (two actually: tarzan growing up and Tarzan learning about civilization).  Is it really so much to ask for them to be expanded?  Despite what people think about the attention span of children, they are often enthralled when things they know are turned on their heads (when I was a kid, I loved that bird in the Little Mermaid whose explanations of forks and pipes were so far off base).The final point I remove is for the allegedly hip side characters, who speak like kids from the 1990's instead of the 1890's.  It really bugs me, but I'm not sure why.  I guess it's partly because ten years from now, kids will be laughing "at" lines like "That one hurt 'em," just like people today laugh at Jimminy Cricket's antiquated idioms.  It dates the movie, and not in a good way.

Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr That is the main phrase of what Tarzan uses when trouble is about to  come. I did enjoy this movie, every minute of it, it was made in 1999,  i think it was is the first ever tarzan movie to be made into a catoon  and to be made by Disney. I you like this movie then i am pretty sure  you will like Tarzan and Jane because that concludes the next part of  Tarzan of what he gets up to this time in the jungle and what missions  he does. I give this movie 10 out of 10 because i think it's brilliant.  I hope they will make a 3rd Tarzan movie, it would be great to see  Tarzan as a daddy. Who know what the future will hold, i hope there  will be another movie because Tarzan is so cool.

God I wish this movie was perfect.Course it has a lot of things going for it that I really like. Characters I love, good themes, music, animation all of these aspects are incredible, but I think it´s the tempo and conclusion on the themes that needed that little more to make Tarzan pure perfection.Tarzan is found as a child by gorillas after his parents were killed by a leopard. He struggles to find out what he really is, until humans start to investigate the island he lives on.A thing I appreciated more this time around was the incredible animation. This is the way I want 2D and 3D animation to blend. The scenery looks incredible, and the outside is more in the 3D realm while inside and additions to scenes seems 2D. It never gets jarring for me to see the blend and the nature and Tarzans family hut are scenes that look stunning. There are so many nature and wide frames highlighting the beauty of 3D animation and something like the ending shot is incredible to look at. The movie looks very unique to me, it´s been a while since I have seen a movie mix the 2D and 3D elements and just in general seeing anything in 2D which I have missed. It works wonders for this movie having the characters look and feel a little cartoony yet serious, as it makes the feats the character does feel more believable and grounded. The action and movements feel so fluent and fast, creating this fast tempo that I really enjoyed.This movie has some amazing themes carried by incredible characters. The themes of belonging and finding your identity among a species that look different to you creates a touching and understandable dilemma for Tarzan when humans are introduced. Tarzan is such an endearing character that is fun and moving to follow. His romance with Jane feels real and Jane is such a fun character together with her dad. The gorillas has some great guidance characters for Tarzan and no character feels perfect. They are all flawed and make understandable mistakes in a confusing time where Tarzan as the mediator, has to find out what he really wants and who he really is. This is also backed by some incredible voice acting from every single character. My only gripe is the comic relief duo that I personally just found to be filler here. They aren't bad or anything jut fluff.The soundtrack in this movie is incredible as well as the score. The camp song could have been removed in my opinion, but I will always have an infinity for the Phil Collins soundtrack. The incredible "Two Worlds" setting up the core themes, "You´ll be in my heart", an underlaying song about who once true family is that also is scored beautifully, "Strangers like me" that fits so well with the montage and my favorite "Son of man" that is so energetic. There was one time where I found the music too much, but other than that it feels incredibly solid.I forgot how violent and bloody this movie is. It feels like the stakes and damages really have an impact and scenes like seeing dead bodies, bloody footprints, wounds and the ending really added to the seriousness of the movie.The biggest problem the movie runs into is it´s overall tempo. The movie feels too fast for it´s own good with the story and themes it wants to tell. The ending feels rushed, the jump from boy to man felt rushed, the romance was believable but rushed and the relationship between characters was, again, believable, but really needed more time in my opinion. This movie could have been perfect Disney movie, if it wasn't hurrying itself along and adding padding instead of character dynamics.But I still love Tarzan. It´s an incredibly solid movie with so many things to love and only some structural problems to really take away from it. I really wished this movie was perfect.

I'm so tired of the Disney formula. They just go through the motions. The story was bland and empty and the characters stock. And then there's those hideous, soaring Phil Collins songs.

From its dramatic opening sequence, to its jubilant, high-five finale, Disney's "Tarzan" is, without question, a very entertaining re-telling of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tale of a helpless, human baby reared to adulthood, in the jungle, by a band of gorillas.Featuring some excellent action sequences (mixed generously with moments of slapstick comedy and the excitement of adventure), 1999's "Tarzan" certainly turned out to be a mighty fine example of first-rate story-telling that actually tugged on this viewer's heartstrings, occasionally.In this animated feature film, the lean and athletic Tarzan (as the story's hero) comes across as being a truly likable and endearing character.Punctuated by songs (which seemed a bit out of place) from pop star, Phil Collins, "Tarzan" is still a delightful movie-experience that can definitely be enjoyed by all ages, young and old.

The true measure of a family film is to watch a child's reaction. My (normally jumpy) three-year-old sat with enraptured glee through this movie and was able to articulate the plot back to me with amazing detail. That's not a parent's rambling, its a credit to a brilliant movie. Tarzan ranks just below Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid in the list of the best of Disney's new films.Disney formula (rogue orphan, evil villain pretending to be a friend, whacky sidekick, neurotic friend and lots a snappy tunes) has never been more apparent, but it works perfectly. But the real joy of this movie is its breathtaking beauty and the message of living without prejudice.Don't expect anything new from Disney, and do not expect a detailed retelling of the original novel. But do expect to see their product refined even further and at its best since Beauty and the Beast. This is a kid's movie, but any grown-up can like it. Minnie Driver and Wayne Knight provide the best voice overs.As my six-year-old daughter told me once, "I like movies with scary beginnings, silly middles and happy endings." Needless to say, she loved Tarzan.  **** out of ****.

Well, being the big animation fan that I am, I went to see Tarzan this afternoon.  Wow.When I first heard that Disney was doing a version of the Tarzan story, I was hesitant.  I mean who wants to hear an ape man spouting out show tunes? Hakuna Matata!  The only songs are some of the best work Phil Collins has done in many years.  He ventures into the Peter Gabriel territory, but does a great job especially with the rhythms since he IS a drummer.  The open number (and sequence) is best albeit Lion King-esque.  It seems he was very inspired by the material and has rediscovered his love of music.  It's very uplifting.  Don't misunderstand me, the characters do sing, but it's more Rosie O'Donnell doing scat with the other apes as they destroy a camp and a very welcome singing cameo by Glenn Close doing the beginning of a lullaby that Phil takes over.As for the picture itself:  wow!  This is the most beautiful Disney animation ever:  lush, detailed, quick and smooth.  Tarzan moves like liquid, filling the screen with gymnastic ease especially the scene where he fights a leopard to save his ape family.And family is what this film is all about.  Disney's Tarzan makes a different decision that Edgar Rice Burroughs' and I think it works better, but it's the decision I would make in the same situation.  Some of the situations are a little contrived, but it is mostly Disney sticking with a winning formula.  (Tarzan does have nipples unlike Aladdin).  :-)  What surprised me was the dramatic tilt of the film. Rosie O'Donnell's ape and the elephant are the only comic relief and don't have much of it.  The film is very skewed towards adults; HOWEVER, as I was surrounded by a mob of kids there was dead silence right after the main gorillas lose their baby and Tarzan loses his parents to the leopard at the beginning.  All the questioning ceased and I got to enjoy the film in complete "adult-like" silence.  The kids were just as wrapped up in the movie as the adults.The voice talent was well cast, too.  Minnie Driver is great as the strong, yet proper British lady of the time.  Her father is a stereotypical egghead professor who is as clumsy as he is smart.  And then there is Brian Blessed as the villain, Clayton.  Man, do I love his voice! It's the Voice of God!  The deep, rich tones always give me a chill.  I wish he worked in more films other then Kenneth Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare films, but alas.... (well, I guess he WAS in The Phantom Menace)This truly is one of Disney's classics.  I felt the same way walking out of this one as I did from Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.Oh, look for a cameo from Mrs. Potts and Chip from Beauty and the Beast!  I thought it was funny, but I don't think anyone else in the theater got it since I seemed to be the only one laughing.   I always embarrass myself at the movies it seems.

From 1989 to 1999, Walt Disney studios created some of the most amazing, mind-blowing animated movies of all time. From the little mermaid to beauty and the beast, from Aladdin to the lion king, from Pocahontas to Hercules, and finally, Mulan to Tarzan, these movies still hold their staying power to today. However, Tarzan was the last of these films, from the period known as the Disney Renaissance. Disney remains a popular animation studio in the public eye, but no one could deny how popular they were throughout the 1990s.Tarzan itself is based upon the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and the movies from the 1930s. Tarzan is a baby who loses his parents, and is adopted by a family of gorillas, who raise him up as their own.For a Disney film, this one is one of the best. For a renaissance film, It's not the best of them. I still like to say that the first 2 (The Little Mermaid & Beauty and the Beast) were the best. I know that some Disney fans would chew on me for not saying The Lion King, but that's just my personal preference.I still think it's a great movie, worthy of being part of the collection of Disney's best.9/10

Jane is chased by a pack of baboons and Tarzan rescues her. Tarzan becomes torn between the jungle and going with Jane to England.The animation is terrific and very energetic. Tarzan swinging in the trees is exciting. The traditional tale is a bit stale and I don't think the montage sequences are that compelling. The Phil Collins music may not be a great fit for a Disney kids movie. Nevertheless this is a good animated movie for the whole family. It has enough excitement and maintains the interest of the audience.

... or no, a 15, maybe.This is right up there with 'The Lion King' and 'Mulan'.  I had the treat to see this last night, and through it all, even the toddlers in the theater loved it!  People have said this is a breakthrough animation-wise, but story-wise, this is like mind-blowing.  Tarzan himself is the first truly deep Disney male character since ... I can't think of a really deep Disney male character, except perhaps Simba from The Lion King.  Tarzan has everything that makes you realize that, though he's raised by apes, he's truly human, and even his upbringing can't hide that (C'mon, if you were raised your whole life thinking you were an ape, and then suddenly find out you're really something else, wouldn't you also be disturbed?)From the first to the last scene was awesome.  Tarzan and the ape Kala's backgrounds were told briefly, poignantly, and emotionfully.  There's (intelligent) humor and love, which only add to the film, and there's an obvious love between Tarzan and Jane.  Someone here said they're not in love, that it's obvious, but I have to strongly disagree.  The scenes between them are funny and give you a feeling that there's a strong attraction (and not just because Jane's interested in studying apes).  And even Jane's father, though he's a small background character, he helps the plot along, and while you'd describe him as "dithering", he has his own funny bone (When Jane is describing Tarzan to him by drawing a picture on a blackboard, she starts to go on about his 'wonderful eyes', and in the midst of her daydream, her father comments, "Would you like me to give you and the blackboard some private time?" Riot!).No, Clayton's not a Jafar or a Gaston, but he's not really the enemy here; he's just an antagonist to help along Tarzan's inner conflict.  The real enemy would be Tarzan's battling against his 'true' world (the one with humans) and the one he's grown up with (the one with apes).  Clayton just resembles a threat to Tarzan's ape family.  In the past, villains were a direct challenge to the hero; here, he is a threat, sure, but he's not the whole movie here.  I like it better this way.  In real life, there's rarely a big evil soul against you, and Clayton seems like a realistic greedy, nasty guy, rather than the cliche megolamincal weirdos of most animated features.I loved Phil Collins.  And while it's great hearing Ariel sing, I think background music was better for this particular movie.  I couldn't see Jane or Tarzan singing; it makes the whole thing almost unrealistic.Tarzan himself was wonderful!  Charismatic, emotional, outgoing, and at the same time, goofy and boyish.  The scenes between him and his ape mother, Kala, were so tender.  I haven't seen such wonderful emotions in live-action movies.  And even Kerchak ... let me tell you something about him.  Even my mom said he was real.  I don't think he was too mean.  He felt threatened by Tarzan's presence.  It wasn't out of superiority.  When Kala first shows baby Tarzan to him, Kerchak is worried about the existence of other humans in the jungle, which might endanger his family of apes.  He only worries about his family, too, and I suspect that, while he keeps a stoic face over the death of his own baby ape in the beginning of the movie, he's not ready to adopt another baby (if one of your kids died, would you be so willing to adopt another right away?  I know I wouldn't).The Lion King, Mulan, and Tarzan all have the same thing in common; they all show true emotion and character, unlike the basic fairy tale fluff like Cinderella and Bambi (nothing against fairy tales, but I like to see true-to-life stuff, you know?).This is a must-see.  If Disney keeps this up, adults may start to change their views of animated stuff.  It ain't just for lil' kids anymore! :)

Based on the famous series of novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 – March 19, 1950), Disney has come up with a pretty entertaining adaptation of the beloved literary character.The first thing I must talk about is the animation. Disney has perfectly blended classic animation with computer animation. The computer animation enhances the classic animation with movement drawings couldn't do. In many scenes, "Tarzan" (child voiced by Alex D. Lintz; adult voiced by Tony Goldwyn) is sliding on large tree branches rapidly. In the classic animation style, they would not have been successful in "following" "Tarzan" through the trees as well as they could with computer animation due to the rapid movement.There are very few dark colors in the scenery. In fact, the only dark colors were used for the gorillas, shadowing and human hair. Most of the colors are light gray, lots of green (it is in a jungle) and other brighter colors.There are some pretty good performances in this film. However, none really stood out in my opinion. I was not that impressed with some supporting characters, as they had little screen time and thus had no time to develop. Rosie O'Donnell was a delight as "Terk," who was "Tarzan's" best gorilla friend.If you ask me, they really missed the mark to make a memorable villain in this film. They had two chances, but killed one, and just did a horrible job making a human villain.As for music, which Disney is known for, there isn't a lot performed on screen by characters like in previous movies. In fact, characters burst into two songs. The rest of the soundtrack is done mainly by Grammy and Academy Award-winning Phil Collins. The songs by Collins is easily a lot more memorable than the rest of the musical score. In fact, all I really can remember is Collins songs. However, the Collins songs, which he wrote and performed, is not as memorable as some of the classic songs Disney is known for. Therefore, if you hear the songs by Collins, you won't be catching yourself singing these tunes, nor will you think of the movie when you hear the songs. The songs did fit well into scenes though.The movie is well paced, however I did think the story was really rushed due to the 89 minute length of the film. They really rushed the part where "Jane" (voiced by Minnie Driver) and the team she was with tried to bring "Tarzan" back to civilization with some of the animal characters as prizes. They also did a pretty good job with the famed relationship between "Jane" and Tarzan. If this movie was a little longer, they really could have worked on many scenes, character development and the relationships between the characters. After seeing this movie, I am almost certain they made the animated television series based on this movie to better explore the relationships in the movie.If you ask me, this is almost a Disney classic. But, in my opinion, it barely misses the mark to be up there with "Snow White" and others touched by Disney's magic.

Okay. They rewrote the whole legend. But Disney has an unerring way of doing that. Anyone remember Pocahontas? They even changed Cinderella, Snow White, and every other Disney Masterpiece sitting on your shelves, so why does it matter that this, too, was changed?It matters on several different levels, but the most important reason it matters is because Disney, in their positioning among the children's entertainment market, is in the unique position to actually teach these legends, these snippets of history, these morals and ethics, to the children of their audiences, rather than proffering sugar-coated, merchandized over-glorifications in exchange for the great American dollar. That having been said, this is still an entertaining introduction to the legend, but I highly suggest "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes," (1984), directed by Hugh Hudson. It is the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen, and a highly enjoyable adventure, which carries a PG rating and is safe for most ages to view.A lot has been said about the deep canvas effect used throughout the jungle scenes, and I must admit that I found the technique highly effective and extremely well done. I do computer graphics myself, and I was very impressed with the 3D effects throughout, including the water variants and textures used in the ship scenes, the fire effects used in the jungle, and the smoke effects from the guns used by the poachers. The textures and backgrounds were absolutely stunning, and for me, as a graphics artist, that's what I look for when I view a quality animation.Very good endeavor.It rates an 8/10 from...the Fiend :.

Tarzan brings to the screen song great animation to a usual Disney feature. The tale of Tarzan (now animated) shows a abandoned boy who is raised by gorillas and one day, finds a trio of humans who change his world forever. Much of the animation (mainly when Tarzan is flying in the trees, literally) reminded me of air surfers who swing on the ropes.  Great fun for all, mainly for kids, and some other stuff for animation fanatics (and some might find a connection to this to anime).  One of the better film of the year (that means it is in the top 20).  A+

This is a tremendous film for everyone to watch. The cast selection was outstanding. This film reveals to viewers a real insight of the world and story of what life and survival can be about. I enjoyed watching this film. The storyline of this film could have been created better. There was some room for improvement. It is still entertaining for everyone who is a Disney fan to watch. There were some parts that did not make any sense to me. The crew could have worked better on those parts. Other parts of this film were unnecessary and could have been taken out. This film is fun to watch. It is one that viewers would enjoy.

Normally, I don't go see animated films in the theater, because of the whiny-kid problem.  But Tarzan looked like it had such fun animation that I wanted to go see it.  But let's not worry too much about why I went to see it, let's instead worry about what it was like.I'll start with the good points:  First, the animation was fantastic.  Not a single moment in the movie fails to live up to the high standards the preview leads you to expect.  I would say the animation was not quite up to the level of The Lion King - mostly because the jungle canopy world of Tarzan is inherently confusing, so evoking it well gives a sense of magic, but not of realism.  9.5 / 10.Music?  Well, the songs were good and I like Phil Collins, so that was a plus.  They didn't fit as well into the movie, though.  I wouldn't classify Tarzan as a musical the same way I would classify most of the recent Disney movies as musicals, because the fact of the matter is, all the songs are background music to certain action sequences.  The characters, for the most part, don't sing.  Also there was less music than the other movies, or at least it seemed that way...  Let me put it this way: this was nowhere near The Little Mermaid in musical quality - the songs seemed to be a gesture rather than central to the movie.  7/10.Humor.  Truth be told, Disney Animated movies haven't been comedies for a long time.  But there are enough funny sight gags and such to keep the tone of the movie light even at serious moments.  Kind of what you would expect. 8/10.Lastly, we come to the plot.  The plot is actually important in this kind of movie - the Lion King wouldn't have worked at all without its plot. However, Tarzan falls significantly short of the excellent mark we have come to expect from Disney.  The story is pretty simple to start - A mother and father with their baby get shipwrecked, and live in a home on the shore. Unfortunately, the parents are killed.  At the same time, a gorilla loses her baby to a leopard.  The gorilla finds the baby human, and takes him back to the family to raise him.  The boy, of course, is Tarzan.  As he grows up, he has problems fitting in - the other youngsters don't accept him, and neither does the head of the family, Kerchak.  Eventually, he learns that he's human, when he meets Jane and her father and their guide, Clayton. Then, he struggles to decide whether he belongs with his family or with the humans that are clearly more like him.Up until this point, the story is nothing short of charming.  Then, Disney adds a gratuitous bad-guy (Clayton, of course, and anyone will see it coming) which completely ruins everything.  Tarzan rushes headlong into the fight which proves what?  He's brave?  He cares about his family?  We knew that already.  There was a point in the movie, right before the bad-guy part of the plot comes in, where I was actually interested.  After that, I just wasn't interested anymore.  Plot: 4 / 10.Oh yeah, one note I wanted to add - this movie should have been rated PG. Three scenes of note (that justify this comment) - at least twice in the movie, we see blood, once, we see the moment of death, not directly but directly enough that I would consider it violence.  Also, Tarzan touches Jane's breasts at one point - in an innocent way, but still.Of course, this is Disney and They Wouldn't Dare Give It A PG Rating.Overall - I enjoyed the movie, but because the thing they did with the plot was so annoying, I'm not going to be seeing it again.  I'd give it a 7/10. Disappointing for Disney, but still a good movie.

Imagine six 50-something and 60-something men and women watching this version of "Tarzan" (Disney, animated)on DVD and at the end, some of them saying "that is the best movie I have ever seen." Well, I can't personally say it was *the best* I've ever seen, but for sheer entertainment there haven't been many better.The story is very familiar to most of us, and this version sticks to the tried and true (!) very well.  The novelty are in the eye-popping Disney animation, the humorous script, and the "delivery" of the lines by the various celebrity voices. I bought the DVD because I want to watch it periodically, and also with my grandchildren as they grow up.The "extras" on the DVD are really fine. Recording of the "Trashing the Camp" music is featured, plus a few other equally interesting features.  The best being a film "short" of the animated Disney feature "Dinosaur" slated for release in May 2000.  I'm going to buy that one too!I gave this movie a solid "9" of "10" for sheer enjoyment.

A different but brilliantly adapted version of Borough's classic novel. From the get go Tarzan will have you wide eyed and waiting to see what will happen next. The opening sequence is one of the most impressive I have ever seen in film. The opening sequence is just so powerful as it shows the contrast of the human family (infant Tarzan with his parents) and the gorilla family living happily before tragedy strikes both families which leads Kala to finding the baby Tarzan. All done without dialog, all done with the great song "Two Worlds" in the background.Changing Tarzan's adoptive family to gorillas worked well because it showed a more gentle side to these great apes, which are often depicted as savage bruits in such films as King Kong and Planet of the apes. Tony Goldwyn did a great job as Tarzan; he hit the right balance of fun loving, relaxed and also emotional when it was required. However, Glen Close gave a soft, angelic voice to Kala that only a mother could have and her bond with both the child and adult Tarzan was at the emotional soul of the film. This was contradicted perfectly by Henriksen's performance as the un-accepting and judgmental ape leader Kurchack. Jane, Tantor, Turk were all great characters that all did well with adding humor at the appropriate times and what I liked about Driver's performance was that she was neither the defiant heroine nor the damsel in distress but rather she was simply a girl who had come to an untamed land and became enchanted with the world of a man she would later fall in love with. I would even go as far as to say that Jane is one of Disney's best female leads.I also give the movie points for the animations, most adaptations would have Tarzan swinging through the trees, but here he actually surfs through the trees.However, I do feel that the villain (voiced by Brian Blessed) was slightly weak in comparison to other characters, Clayton is not very interesting in terms of motivation but I do feel he could have been more unique if he had been made to look younger, I would have preferred to see him have the looks of say John Smith from Pocahontas, he just seemed quite forgettable but held up in the film's final third. I also feel the film would have been more effective if Sabor was given a speaking part. Simply having the leopard growl and roar seemed to make him a brainless carnivore as opposed to an enemy and in my humble opinion Sabor would have been more intimidating if the had a speaking role to match his ferocity.The film's strongest point was it's music and Phil Collins and Mark Mancina joined forces to create one of the greatest soundtracks I have heard in a very long time. With the exception of "Trashing the camp" which was sung by Turk, Collins used his actual voice for all of the songs and tunes such as "Son of Man" or "Strangers like me" or the Oscar winning "You'll be in my heart" will all go down as classics and give the film for being original and not sticking to the traditional musical tone.As one of the final traditionally animated films to be considered a hit, and is probably the greatest depiction of the story of Tarzan ever put on the big screen. An absolute must see.

I found this surprisingly good because not only was animation well done - which they all seem to be in the past decade - but an involving, action-packed story that was interesting start-to-finish. The action is not overdone, however. The color in here is magnificent and it looks spectacular on DVD.The film turned out to be a good combination of drama, action, comedy and romance. I would think this would be a little too frightening, however, for little kids, for those wondering about that. The only negative I had was listening to the grating voice of Rose O'Donnell. That, and her New York City, accent, is definitely not appealing. Otherwise, I have nothing but good things to say about this film.

Tarzan has never moved like this before.  Not even Johnny Weismuller could execute the moves that the animated Tarzan does, and Weismuller is the best Tarzan!  Disney's version of the Edgar Rice Burroughs story brings a grand, lush visual splendor to the jungle that can only be seen in animation.  What's nice about this Disney adventure is the fact that the characters do not break out into song.  Phil Collins' songs reinforce the images on the screen and do not intrude on the narrative.  The film is light on its feet and hits all the right buttons.  The vocal casting is good.  Lance Henrikson brings the right amount of menace to Kerchek and Minnie Driver was perfectly cast as Jane.  As stated before, the film is animated in a lush manner that no live action film could accomplish easily.  The deep canvas technique that was employed moves the action so effortlessly, you might get a little dizzy from all the twists and turns.  All in all, a fine adventure from the folks at Disney.

Tarzan is a very good film indeed, and is without doubt the last great Disney movie. It only has one flaw, that's it, and in comparison to Hercules (weakest Disney of the 90s)that's saying something. The animation is just gorgeous. I have been to Africa, and never have I seen the African Jungle look so beautiful. The songs, performed by Phil Collins mostly, are very pleasant, though I must confess, that I did get annoyed once when my sister played "Two worlds" at loud volume on the computer, for what felt like an eternity. The characters are great, Tarzan is a wonderfully charismatic lead. My favourite character was Jane, thanks to a brilliant characterisation from the underrated Minnie Driver. Terk and Tantor provide great comic relief, and the gorillas provide plenty of quite emotional scenes. The weakest character, was the aforementioned Clayton. Although Brian Blessed voiced him with enthusiasm, Clayton wasn't particularly likable. The main reason why I like this movie as much as I do, is the thoroughly human portrayals of the characters, and it was also the first time in a Disney since Beauty and the Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame when I cried at the very end of the movie. Who would, it's really emotional. Tarzan is a must-see for Disney fans. It's not perfect, but it's miles better than the trash out today. 9/10 Bethany Cox

I have to say I was quite dissapointed by Tarzan. It just didn't hold up to Disney's standards. Instead of an interesting, original story like in classics such as The Lion King, or Mulan. Tarzan was merely a copy of every "jungle-boy" movie ever made.I must however hand it to this movie for being the best Tarzan I've ever seen. The music was average, but if nothing else watch it for the spectacular animation.Overall 7/10, not outrageously terrible but not bewildering.

The soundtrack to Tarzan is unmatched, Phil Collins made each song unique and the right vibe. The storyline is expected and there are few good heartfelt and comedic moments.

Certainly one of the best Disney movies of the last twenty years. The character design is quite good, animation are kinda perfect or - better - futuristic for the year, the dubbing works well and the "pop-ing" soundtrack is not that bad as well, this added to the funny moments makes of this movie freely inspired to Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes a nice media for kids and easy romance lovers.Now you're going to say wow this movie is perfect, right? And I'll reply you ABSOLUTELY NOT. This movie is far from perfection for quotes to movies that '99 kids wouldn't be able to understand like the baboons scene that mention Birds from Hitchcocks; on another side the easy happy ending, which is a great difference from the book, brutally cut the pathos on the last scene. OK it's Disney and it's a family movie but a little bitter never killed anyone. Speaking of the difference from Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel, Jane and prof. Porter teach Tarzan about civil life out of the jungle using a series of slides when in the book, Tarzan learn himself due to his intelligence. Don't know you but to me this scene looks like Clockwork Orange's brainwash scene where scientists works on Alex's mind to rebuilt it, or if you prefer like "your own study with books is less meaningless let us tell you what about the world" which is such a bad lessons for kids that personally I kinda hate that.In conclusion, if you're looking for a classic kid movie with nice drawing and animation you're quite welcome but if you're looking for a good book transposition or a quality and wise movie keep seeking.

Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr That is the main phrase of what Tarzan uses when trouble is about to  come. I did enjoy this movie, every minute of it, it was made in 1999,  i think it was is the first ever tarzan movie to be made into a catoon  and to be made by Disney. I you like this movie then i am pretty sure  you will like Tarzan and Jane because that concludes the next part of  Tarzan of what he gets up to this time in the jungle and what missions  he does. I give this movie 10 out of 10 because i think it's brilliant.  I hope they will make a 3rd Tarzan movie, it would be great to see  Tarzan as a daddy. Who know what the future will hold, i hope there  will be another movie because Tarzan is so cool.

TARZAN  (1999)   * * *     What's good about it: incredible animation, great voice characterization by Minnie Driver.  What's bad about it: generic music by Phil Collins, very distracting voice work by a tiresomely obnoxious Rosie O'Donnell.  What's so-so about it: standard, formulaic Disney story which pretty much writes itself by now.

I'm so tired of the Disney formula. They just go through the motions. The story was bland and empty and the characters stock. And then there's those hideous, soaring Phil Collins songs.
