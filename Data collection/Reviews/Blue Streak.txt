Blue StreakStarring: Martin Lawrence, Dave Chappelle and Luke WilsonGenre: Action/Comedy/CrimeRated: PG-13Another great Action/Comedy buddy movie! The movie is about a bank robber named Miles Logan (Martin Lawrence) who steals a crafty jewel and then hides it in a construction site where his $20 Million heist went awry. Now that he is out of jail, he wants to get the loot back! But the problem was that the place where he hid it was now the new Los Angeles Police Station. So Miles goes in as a member of the LAPD and works with Carlson (Luke Wilson) a rookie at the LAPD. So now Miles gives up being a thief and becomes a detective. One of my most favorite Martin Lawrence movies ever! One of my favorite parts was when Miles was disguising as a wacky pizza delivery man. This is one of the most successful Martin Lawrence movies plus another one of the best movies of 1999! One of the best Martin Lawrence movies ever!

Blue Streak is exactly what you think it is. A fun, explosion filled action comedy from the 90s. It gives you exactly what it promises, no more no less. A solid, sit back and relax with your feet up movie.I have a serious soft spot for films like this. They put you in a good mood, letting you forget your troubles for an hour and a half. Nothing game changing, but 100% as advertised. Really enjoyed this one.Have a good one.

Martin Lawrence and Luke Wilson are very funny, I loved some of the scenes like the interrogation and Wilson's character trying to be respected, quite funny.However, the villain was quite poor and not nearly fun enough for such a film. Also, the camerawork wasn't very good in my opinion and the plot was quite poor.5/10: All in all quite a funny film, not amazingly well made and I won't view it a second time but has its moments nonetheless

Personally I enjoyed this.  I often just want to sit down, relax, ad watch a film that I don't have to think about and will make me laugh.  This fits the bill perfectly and I throughly enjoyed it.A lot of people wold put down this film, mostly in my opinion to make themselves look sophisticated. I think if most people were honest they would say they had liked this film, at least to a certain extent.

BLUE STREAK (1999) ***Starring: Martin Lawrence, Luke Wilson, Peter Greene, David Chappelle, Graham Beckel Director: Les Mayfield   93 minutes    Rated PG-13 (for language and violence) By Blake French:	Martin Lawrence was born to star in movies like "Blue Streak," a film with much energy and wit, both elements he has coming out of his ears. The film has no major flaw in it. There are no structural problems, dialogue issues, disruptive subplots, characterization uncertainty or tedious nuggets found in it. The filmmakers take advantage of Lawrence being in the movie, and have lots of fun with both him and the plot--things that make this comedy worthy of a minimal recommendation. The film opens with four jewel thieves, Miles Logan, Deacon, Eddie, and Tulley, constructing a heist in the middle of a dark, cold night attempting to steal a large diamond worth millions. Miles and Eddie sneak in the building, that beholds the valuable rock, from the roof using a steady rope to lure them down through the elevator shaft to their destination: a security safe, located a few floors down. Deacon stays above assuring Eddie and Miles' safely, while Tulley stands watch below in the getaway car.
Then, something goes wrong. While the team of bandits do indeed succeed in breaking through the buildings security and swindle the diamond, when Miles and Eddie reach Deacon on the roof, however,  he states that he is too greedy to spilt the value of the gem four ways, thus killing Eddie, and attempting to finish off Miles, who is holding on to the jewel, but before Deacon has the chance, the police arrive, and off goes Tulley in the getaway car, leaving Deacon and Miles no way to escape except to flee to a construction site nearby. There, Deacon manages to avoid being arrested by the cops, but never gets his hand on the gem. However, Miles keenly hides the jewel in the duct of this developing building, and makes note of where he hides it. As he arrested by the police, he vows to return for the secret treasure after his prison sentence is up--whenever that may be.
Two years pass. Miles is happy to once again be a free citizen. He returns to his girlfriend, who, after never visiting him once in the two years he spent in jail, dumps him without a second thought. Miles is not too depressed, however, for he still has seventeen million dollars waiting for his arrival at the old contraction site where he hid it. The problem: that exact constriction site is now finished. It is a brand spanking new police headquarters! Miles tries desperately to enter the building, only to be rejected by security every time. That is, however, until one of his old buddies manufactures a false police identification for him, thus allowing him to break into the building, and search for his beauty.  This is when he becomes involved with a crime bust that leads the police chief to believe that Miles is a professional, experienced cop, who is then partnered up with novice detective Carlson (Luke Wilson) to solve a criminal case. From here on out, the film runs from high energy and action packed excitement to clumsy and funny stunts of Logan trying to undercover the dream he once had located in what is now his office building. Director Les Mayfield lets the film's  writers have a lot of fun with the plot. The setup is at shaky  and first a bit ridiculous, but then propels the entire story following it though the problems it faces; when the plot stumbles at times and forgets its purpose, the Logan character still has reason to continue on: the 17 million dollar jewel. The filmmakers do rely a bit much on that concept, but for the most part, the film stays clear from too many troubles. Just a few days ago, I screened the horror thriller "Stigmata," and ended up not recommending it due to the fact that the film's scenes did not fit together to create a story possible to follow. While "Blue Streak" does fit together evenly and is distributive, if the truth be know, I would choose to see something with a little more depth, like "Stigmata," than something as shallow as "Blue Streak." But I feel that the majority of an audience goes to the movies for entertainment, not for some deep, disturbing message--if you're that kind of a moviegoer, then "Blue Streak" is for you.

Really decent film and Martin Lawrence is really good in this role. Some good comedy with a good story, not every film is a classic but it can still be really enjoyable.

I really thought this movie would be another lame comedy movie but I was laughing a lot and at some moments i was at the edge of my seat. I didn't think comedy movies would have great action scenes but this one was actually decent. Even though I'm not a fan of Martin Lawrence at all he was great in this movie.If you're a kinda person who only watches movie that touches you and just has no sense of humor then this movie isn't for you! But it's a good movie to watch with your friends and family for a great laugh.Grade: 7/10

This caper film opens with thief Miles Logan leading a raid to steal a massive diamond; it goes wrong when gang member Deacon gets greedy and shots another of the gang leaving his body to fall from the building onto a police car parked below. Logan manages to get out and stashes the diamond in a ventilation duct of a building under construction before being arrested. Two years later he is released from jail and returns to the building and is horrified to learn that it is now a police station! In order to get into the building he steals a pass then gets a friend to change the picture. His friend also provides paperwork suggesting that Logan is a cop being transferred to the station. Unfortunately his friend is a bit too complimentary the paperwork suggests that he is some sort of super-cop! His plan to be in and out quickly go wrong and he finds himself doing actual police work and even getting promoted during this time his sole priority is getting his hands on the diamond.When I sat down to watch this I wasn't expecting too much; it was just the 'third film' in a triple pack where I wanted to watch the other two as it turned out I enjoyed it the most of the three. The story is fairly basic but it is a lot of fun. Martin Lawrence does a fine job as Logan; sometimes he crosses into silliness but he also delivers some genuine laugh out loud moments. He also manages to do the action and straighter moments in a solid manner. The rest of the cast are solid as well; most notably Luke Wilson as the rookie detective Logan is partnered with and Peter Greene who is suitably unpleasant as Deacon. As well as the comedy there are some impressive action sequences including the opening heist and the shootout followed by a race to the Mexican border in the final scene. Overall I wouldn't call this a must see film but if you are looking for ninety minutes of comedy action with little in the way of offensive material you could do a lot worse than this.

I dont know why this movie is hated by so many people.  It's funny, action packed and Martin Lawrence and the rest of the cast give good performances. Sure it's pretty unbelievable but so are most movies out there.  Also, the film has a solid car chase scene at the end which is a solid way to end a fine film.  The opening heist scene is also pretty good as well, a good way to start the film.  Also the shootout at the grocery store is very funny, as well as several other scene's.  Highly Recommended,  for anyone who likes action-comedies.  4/5

A pretty good Martin Lawrence comedy, with some great one liners and a decent plot. Comedy was there throughout and the storyline was fairly well developed.

"Blue Streak" stars Martin Lawrence as a thief, who for some complicated reasons (complicated for him - not for the film viewers!) must disguise himself as a police officer and infiltrate police headquarters. With an uninspired premise, decent acting talent, and a bad script, "Blue Streak" offers few laughs, and a predictably stupid finale. "Blue Streak" is one to be missed.2/5 stars-John Ulmer

This film made me laugh from beginning to end only because of the great actor and comic, Martin Lawrence(Miles Logan),"Bad BoysII",'03, who is a bank robber, winds up hiding a large diamond gem in the heating ventilation of the LAPD Headquarters.  Miles is very comical getting into jail and getting out and then trying to find this diamond gem after spending two(2) years in prison.  Words cannot completely describe this great entertaining film.    Luke Wilson, (Carlson),"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle",'03, is a great supporting straight man for Miles and the two of them made this a great worth viewing.  Martin Lawrence is destined to become a great Super Star of the Future!

In one of the few movies where Martin Lawrence's humor doesn't become seriously racist and xenophobic he plays Miles Logan, a jewel thief, after a $20 million diamond. But one of his team betrays him (Peter Greene, once again playing a bad guy) and they're plan is thrown all out of whack. After hastily stashing the diamond in a nearby construction site he is soon arrested sent away for 2 years. Upon release he heads back to the construction site only to find it's turned into a police station. No luck getting back in unless you're a cop then. A series of disguises fail and Logan ends up impersonating a cop in order to get to the diamond. But he's so good at the impersonation that police duty gets in the way and he's partnered with Carlson (Luke Wilson).Mild plot complications ensue and it becomes increasingly difficult for Logan to get to the diamond. Though the trouble really starts when Deacon (Peter Greene) comes back to get him. It's all brainless stuff but it makes for enjoyably silly viewing. Lawrence's improv isn't all that funny but the rest of his performance is strangely tolerable. Wilson isn't his usual self in the wimpy cop role but it's weird watching him pronounce 'real OLD SCHOOL' 4 years before said movie was released. And Dave Chappelle is hilarious Tulley, the amateur liquor store robber.There was supposed to be a sequel but plans for it fell through. It would have been a hundred times better than the awful Bad Boys sequel regardless of script quality.The DVD is in bright, clean 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with a lively Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. There are some extras but nothing groundbreaking.

Certainly makes the L.A.P.D. look bad.   Another film to be filed in my movies to avoid folder.  First class trash which underlinesthe second rate comedy purveyed by Martin Lawrence.   Anyone who likes this movie is in serious trouble (mentally).

"Blue Streak" is an enjoyable film that stars one of the funniest comedians in the business, Martin Lawrence. Lawrence is teamed with Luke Wilson as they take on the bad guys using humor. From the very beginning, I knew that "Blue Streak" would be funny and interesting. The only requirement was to sit back and relax so the movie can carry me through. The story was quite unique having a thief pretend to be a police detective determined to collect a jewel left behind from a previous heist. To make the plot better and more interesting the writers make Lawrence's character in charge of the burglary division. Wilson didn't really add to the story and seemed to fill a role of sidekick. It was a pleasure to see William Forsythe in a role that did not have playing a villain. Overall, "Blue Streak" worked for me.

Always enjoyed this good-hearted 90's action Cop-Comedy with Martin Lawrence at his best.
This is the best of Martin Lawrence's own films, way better than the over-the-top & too silly Big Momma's House & way better than the Annoying & Racist National Security, here it's the best Martin has been since his team-up with Will Smith in Bad Boys.
This is a nice, easy & simple comical story about a Jewel theif named Miles Logan (Lawrence) who hides a Diamond in an empty building after after a robbery & is then captured by the police & does a 2 year stretch. Back out as a Free man, Logan finds out the empty building is now an L.A police department building, so Logan now has to impersonate a Cop in order to get in & find his Diamond he hid in the air vents.This hilarious & feel good Buddy Cop Comedy has an Awesome cast with Luke Wilson (Vacancy) as Lawrence's new partner, Carlson who is great fun as the easy going & loyal but timid cop & we have one of my personal favourite Actors the always great William Forsythe (Out For Justice) as the tough but very funny Detective HardCastle & he steals every scene he's in with his Cool rugged voice & Old school style Cop Moustache, there's also Graham Beckel (C.h.u.d) who plays the excitable police Captain Rizzo, also we get the hilarious Dave Chappell as Tulley (The Nutty Professor) who is one of Logan's Criminal friends & we get one of the greats of playing movie villains, Peter Greene (Pulp Fiction, Judgment Night) as Deacon, one of Logan's Criminal friends who turned Enemy & there's more that all make an Awesome & big cast of talent.There's lots of very funny scenes such as Lawrence's disguise as a pizza delivery man & the hilarious scenes of with Lawrence in the interrogation room with Dave Chappell, comic genius stuff right there lol!!! All the fun buddy cop interactions between Lawrence & Wilson are all good fun too. There's lots of Action & shootouts & just the good old 90's Cop Action Comedy stuff.Blue Streak is good solid fun, late night Cop Comedy Action

This Martin Lawrence film is really pretty good, because the story is original and the acting is good (most of the time). The only thing that really bothered me was that Martin Lawrence had to play one of those over the edge black criminals. Take for instance the way he tries to pizzaman his way into the LAPD at the beginning. Is all that stupid singing and dancing necessary?? There are some other examples like that which are like cliché stuff when there is a film about a black guy. Like the music has to be loud and hip hop and they swing on it while driving. Also why is he eating snacks during that robbery when he is not alone? Does he have to wait until he hears his partner calling. Apart from those parts (some major, some minor) this is a good film, those scenes though make it only pretty good. There are some really good scenes here though too and I especially liked the whole ending in New Mexico.
7 out of 10

Well, "Blue Streak" is the kind of comedy that worked well in 90's, but nowadays doesn't work that good anymore. It's the famous funny action movie with a famous Hollywood comedian-- which isn't really the case, since Martin Lawrence isn't that famous and never was.The plot of this film is something creative that deliver some smiling moments, but never truly invokes the laughter. I didn't expect to laugh a lot, so I am not disappointed at all. If you give this a chance, be prepared to see a naive and silly action comedy without many achievements, but entertaining enough to give you a good time. And I just don't give it a 7 because it makes fun of American Police Departments-- thought I'm not a cop even in my country, I'm well informed of all the problems that a disrespected police can cause to a whole country.

This movie really delivers in the laughter department and succeeds as a vehicle for star Martin Lawrence. In the film, Lawrence plays a thief who steals a diamond and manages to hide it in a building structure before being caught and sent to prison for two years. Upon his release, he finds that the building is now a police station, and he has to impersonate a cop to get in and claim his prize. That is where the real fun stuff begins. The movie is funny.*** out of ****

Lets be under no illusions here, if Martin Lawrence gets on your nerves then it's very safe to suggest one stays away from this piece. His brand of comedy ranges from the pratfall antics of Jerry Lewis to the more vibrant delivery of someone like Richard Pryor, yet asking him to carry a movie on his own is still risky at best. He has achieved a level of success by having the knack to raise a laugh out of the most moronic of situations, and here in Blue Streak he milks it for all he is worth, and I personally find the film a good cure for the blues.Miles Logan (Lawrence) gets caught post a diamond robbery, luckily for him he has hidden the diamond in an air vent at a building that is under construction, unluckily for him tho, is that when he gets out of prison two years later, he finds that the building under construction is now a police station! This sets us up for the splendid plot of criminal wise cracker Logan having to fake being a police officer to hopefully get his hands back on the diamond! Naturally things don't go to plan and things steadily spiral out of control.The film is fun, it doesn't have an overlong running time, so with that the viewer doesn't feel a sense of too much Lawrence overacting, some solid support from Luke Wilson & William Forsythe adds to the merriment, and the action junkies are suitably catered for as well, so all in all a very solid 6.5/10 from me.

Logan (Lawrence) is a thief amongst thieves and as you know there's no honor amongst 'em. They make a score, snatch a huge diamond. Which parlays into a predictable betrayal and before he's caught by police, Logan is able to hide it in a building under construction. Simple enough, right? Here's the rub. Years later after getting out of the joint, he comes to find out the building he hid the diamond in is now a police station.Sure the setup sounds unique, but believe me when I say nothing fresh ever comes of it. This is predictable filmmaking in every sense. One-liners, shoot-outs, an explosion or two and a side cast virtually wasted. That's Blue Streak. Lawrence mugs for the camera. William Forsythe gets the forgettable gruff "Nick Nolte" role. Luke Wilson gets to play the straight laced green second banana to Martin Lawrence. Peter Greene gets to play another heavy. It's cookie cutter product the likes of which we've been being feed forever.Whenever or not you buy into the fake cop act doesn't even seem to matter when the film can't sustain the funny. Logan bumbles his way through never raising an eye as the movie plays dumb for the sake of being dumb. A lot of people like this movie for reasons I don't quite understand. Then again, Blue Streak features an ending where we're supposed to feel good about a convicted thief escaping to Mexico with a stolen multi-million dollar diamond too.

I know that many people may not like this movie, but I thought it was very good. The plot was very simple and unique, the characters performed well, and the movie itself was very entertaining. There were some funny and memorable parts, including the famous oodles of noodles scene. In my opinion the funniest character in Blue Streak was Sulley. All of his parts were funny, and I feel he expressed his part very well. I recommend that you see this movie before Blue Streak 2 comes out in 2002. Overall, 8 of 10.

This movie reminded me of the "Police Academy" series, but with better action scenes, and Martin Lawrence as an improvement over Steve Guttenberg. It's a little lame, and the cops are a little too dumb, but it manages to walk home with out falling down. Martin Lawrence kind of makes it work, and Luke Wilson makes do as a gullible partner that, hey...Steve Guttenberg could have had fun with.

Simplistic, moronic, what word best describes this inane piece of garbage? Gee, I knew the LAPD had troubles, but are you telling me that every officer in it is this freaking stupid? Man, I do like Martin Lawrence, but the collective IQ of the writers of this film must be as high as the same group that crapped out "Black Knight." This movie is not just dumb, it transcends dumb and takes us to a new level of dumb. For those that do not know the story, here it is. Martin needs to get a diamond he hid in a police station, so he just walks in and pretends to be a cop. He does not act, talk or do anything like a cop. Yet, for some reason, there is no doubt that he is one. You know what, who cares? 0 out of ****.

"Blue Streak" is an enjoyable film that stars one of the funniest comedians in the business, Martin Lawrence. Lawrence is teamed with Luke Wilson as they take on the bad guys using humor. From the very beginning, I knew that "Blue Streak" would be funny and interesting. The only requirement was to sit back and relax so the movie can carry me through. The story was quite unique having a thief pretend to be a police detective determined to collect a jewel left behind from a previous heist. To make the plot better and more interesting the writers make Lawrence's character in charge of the burglary division. Wilson didn't really add to the story and seemed to fill a role of sidekick. It was a pleasure to see William Forsythe in a role that did not have playing a villain. Overall, "Blue Streak" worked for me.

Always enjoyed this good-hearted 90's action Cop-Comedy with Martin Lawrence at his best.
This is the best of Martin Lawrence's own films, way better than the over-the-top & too silly Big Momma's House & way better than the Annoying & Racist National Security, here it's the best Martin has been since his team-up with Will Smith in Bad Boys.
This is a nice, easy & simple comical story about a Jewel theif named Miles Logan (Lawrence) who hides a Diamond in an empty building after after a robbery & is then captured by the police & does a 2 year stretch. Back out as a Free man, Logan finds out the empty building is now an L.A police department building, so Logan now has to impersonate a Cop in order to get in & find his Diamond he hid in the air vents.This hilarious & feel good Buddy Cop Comedy has an Awesome cast with Luke Wilson (Vacancy) as Lawrence's new partner, Carlson who is great fun as the easy going & loyal but timid cop & we have one of my personal favourite Actors the always great William Forsythe (Out For Justice) as the tough but very funny Detective HardCastle & he steals every scene he's in with his Cool rugged voice & Old school style Cop Moustache, there's also Graham Beckel (C.h.u.d) who plays the excitable police Captain Rizzo, also we get the hilarious Dave Chappell as Tulley (The Nutty Professor) who is one of Logan's Criminal friends & we get one of the greats of playing movie villains, Peter Greene (Pulp Fiction, Judgment Night) as Deacon, one of Logan's Criminal friends who turned Enemy & there's more that all make an Awesome & big cast of talent.There's lots of very funny scenes such as Lawrence's disguise as a pizza delivery man & the hilarious scenes of with Lawrence in the interrogation room with Dave Chappell, comic genius stuff right there lol!!! All the fun buddy cop interactions between Lawrence & Wilson are all good fun too. There's lots of Action & shootouts & just the good old 90's Cop Action Comedy stuff.Blue Streak is good solid fun, late night Cop Comedy Action

This Martin Lawrence film is really pretty good, because the story is original and the acting is good (most of the time). The only thing that really bothered me was that Martin Lawrence had to play one of those over the edge black criminals. Take for instance the way he tries to pizzaman his way into the LAPD at the beginning. Is all that stupid singing and dancing necessary?? There are some other examples like that which are like cliché stuff when there is a film about a black guy. Like the music has to be loud and hip hop and they swing on it while driving. Also why is he eating snacks during that robbery when he is not alone? Does he have to wait until he hears his partner calling. Apart from those parts (some major, some minor) this is a good film, those scenes though make it only pretty good. There are some really good scenes here though too and I especially liked the whole ending in New Mexico.
7 out of 10

In one of the few movies where Martin Lawrence's humor doesn't become seriously racist and xenophobic he plays Miles Logan, a jewel thief, after a $20 million diamond. But one of his team betrays him (Peter Greene, once again playing a bad guy) and they're plan is thrown all out of whack. After hastily stashing the diamond in a nearby construction site he is soon arrested sent away for 2 years. Upon release he heads back to the construction site only to find it's turned into a police station. No luck getting back in unless you're a cop then. A series of disguises fail and Logan ends up impersonating a cop in order to get to the diamond. But he's so good at the impersonation that police duty gets in the way and he's partnered with Carlson (Luke Wilson).Mild plot complications ensue and it becomes increasingly difficult for Logan to get to the diamond. Though the trouble really starts when Deacon (Peter Greene) comes back to get him. It's all brainless stuff but it makes for enjoyably silly viewing. Lawrence's improv isn't all that funny but the rest of his performance is strangely tolerable. Wilson isn't his usual self in the wimpy cop role but it's weird watching him pronounce 'real OLD SCHOOL' 4 years before said movie was released. And Dave Chappelle is hilarious Tulley, the amateur liquor store robber.There was supposed to be a sequel but plans for it fell through. It would have been a hundred times better than the awful Bad Boys sequel regardless of script quality.The DVD is in bright, clean 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with a lively Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. There are some extras but nothing groundbreaking.

This movie really delivers in the laughter department and succeeds as a vehicle for star Martin Lawrence. In the film, Lawrence plays a thief who steals a diamond and manages to hide it in a building structure before being caught and sent to prison for two years. Upon his release, he finds that the building is now a police station, and he has to impersonate a cop to get in and claim his prize. That is where the real fun stuff begins. The movie is funny.*** out of ****

Lets be under no illusions here, if Martin Lawrence gets on your nerves then it's very safe to suggest one stays away from this piece. His brand of comedy ranges from the pratfall antics of Jerry Lewis to the more vibrant delivery of someone like Richard Pryor, yet asking him to carry a movie on his own is still risky at best. He has achieved a level of success by having the knack to raise a laugh out of the most moronic of situations, and here in Blue Streak he milks it for all he is worth, and I personally find the film a good cure for the blues.Miles Logan (Lawrence) gets caught post a diamond robbery, luckily for him he has hidden the diamond in an air vent at a building that is under construction, unluckily for him tho, is that when he gets out of prison two years later, he finds that the building under construction is now a police station! This sets us up for the splendid plot of criminal wise cracker Logan having to fake being a police officer to hopefully get his hands back on the diamond! Naturally things don't go to plan and things steadily spiral out of control.The film is fun, it doesn't have an overlong running time, so with that the viewer doesn't feel a sense of too much Lawrence overacting, some solid support from Luke Wilson & William Forsythe adds to the merriment, and the action junkies are suitably catered for as well, so all in all a very solid 6.5/10 from me.

Logan (Lawrence) is a thief amongst thieves and as you know there's no honor amongst 'em. They make a score, snatch a huge diamond. Which parlays into a predictable betrayal and before he's caught by police, Logan is able to hide it in a building under construction. Simple enough, right? Here's the rub. Years later after getting out of the joint, he comes to find out the building he hid the diamond in is now a police station.Sure the setup sounds unique, but believe me when I say nothing fresh ever comes of it. This is predictable filmmaking in every sense. One-liners, shoot-outs, an explosion or two and a side cast virtually wasted. That's Blue Streak. Lawrence mugs for the camera. William Forsythe gets the forgettable gruff "Nick Nolte" role. Luke Wilson gets to play the straight laced green second banana to Martin Lawrence. Peter Greene gets to play another heavy. It's cookie cutter product the likes of which we've been being feed forever.Whenever or not you buy into the fake cop act doesn't even seem to matter when the film can't sustain the funny. Logan bumbles his way through never raising an eye as the movie plays dumb for the sake of being dumb. A lot of people like this movie for reasons I don't quite understand. Then again, Blue Streak features an ending where we're supposed to feel good about a convicted thief escaping to Mexico with a stolen multi-million dollar diamond too.

I know that many people may not like this movie, but I thought it was very good. The plot was very simple and unique, the characters performed well, and the movie itself was very entertaining. There were some funny and memorable parts, including the famous oodles of noodles scene. In my opinion the funniest character in Blue Streak was Sulley. All of his parts were funny, and I feel he expressed his part very well. I recommend that you see this movie before Blue Streak 2 comes out in 2002. Overall, 8 of 10.

Blue Streak (1999)5 word summaryDimond thief poses as detective As with most Martin Lawrence films, I enjoyed Blue Streak more when I was younger, however, I'm not saying I don't enjoy it. Blue Streak is probably one of my favorite Martin Lawrence films, along with What's The Worst That Could Happen, Life, and Wild Hogs. It's completely unrealistic and not all that well performed or even casted, but it does make me laugh. If you get past the part of it being ridiculous (as far as realistic goes) the scenes are decently set up. If a criminal was able to do what Lawrence's character does then these are some of the funny things that could happen and the reaction he would have had to them. At the same time, not all the parts are like this and some scenes are just kind of stupid. Lawrence does alright for himself. He never has really been a great actor but he is sometimes pretty funny and that's what happened here. Tolerable performance, funny lines. Sometimes he does good and has actually funny and well done lines like in Life, other times he is not funny and just annoying, like in Black Knight. Dave Chappelle was definitely the highlight of the film. He is hilarious in almost every one of his scenes, making me wish he was in it more. Peter Greene gave basically the exact same performance as he did in The Mask, Training Day, Pulp Fiction and I'm assuming a lot of his other roles. He plays a good bad guy but nothing special. Luke Wilson was OK at best, same with the rest of the cast. The film is only held together by the comedy. It's an action comedy but the action is pretty clichéd. Your average gunfights and same old car chases, with some funny stuff here in there. Acting is OK, directing OK, story is pretty dumb and so on. Nothing special. If you enjoy Martin Lawrence then you will enjoy this film. If you don't like him don't even attempt to watch it. I like the movie but I'll say it's nothing worth going out of your way to see. If it's on TV or something and you are in the mood to have some laughs then go for it. Perhaps you will really like it. 7/10

Simplistic, moronic, what word best describes this inane piece of garbage? Gee, I knew the LAPD had troubles, but are you telling me that every officer in it is this freaking stupid? Man, I do like Martin Lawrence, but the collective IQ of the writers of this film must be as high as the same group that crapped out "Black Knight." This movie is not just dumb, it transcends dumb and takes us to a new level of dumb. For those that do not know the story, here it is. Martin needs to get a diamond he hid in a police station, so he just walks in and pretends to be a cop. He does not act, talk or do anything like a cop. Yet, for some reason, there is no doubt that he is one. You know what, who cares? 0 out of ****.
