It really doesn't surprise me that some people don't like this film. After all to truly enjoy Open Water one must open their mind and think. In this day and age that hardly ever happens anymore. Most filmmakers just decide to blow things up and hope that it's enough to entertain their audiences. Society in general has become numb what with the plots just laid out in front of us never questioning or asking us to use our imaginations. Open Water is a film that asks its viewers to place themselves at the heart of the movie; to feel the desperation, the hopelessness and the absolute terrifying ordeal. And for a change the movie is shot in a way that allows the viewer to feel as if truly there. Is it Jaws? No and its not meant to be. Maybe that's where the confusion lays. Open Water is a suspenseful film, excellent at that. If you're someone who actually enjoys figuring out the movie for yourself instead of being told in the first five minutes this is the film for you. Score: A.

First of all congratulations to Chris Kentis for spotting this topic and writing and directing the film. Now you can tell after praising the film maker up front the rest of this review is going to be quite critical! This film unnerved me, it made me feel uncomfortable as well and that's the problem - it should have frightened the absolute living daylights out of me! Because I rate being deserted at sea in shark-infested waters right up there in the scary-stakes with being buried alive. Now I respect Mr Kentis and his collaborators decision to tell the story in a very minimalist way, I guess they considered this story was powerful enough on its own not to require a heavy hand, and I could have agreed with them pre production. But now having seen it I don't think it was. I'm not saying they needed full on John Williams score and masses of special effects but perhaps varying the camera angles a bit more would have worked better.Most of the story is told with the camera in an elevated position looking down on the protagonists, i.e a boat! This means I am divorced from any threat or the action. Couldn't we have got down to eye level more allowing us to feel we were more apart of the story? It was our toes about be chomped off? I'm afraid in the drama stakes this movie never got anymore dramatic than the average TV docu-drama and that's a real shame for after coming up with this concept and creating a half decent script Mr Kentis has missed an opportunity to create a classic.

An excellent example of how a very high-quality survival film can be made for a low budget. The emphasis in the film is on the development of relationships in a couple thrown into the sea. Sharks appear in moments, which is not surprising for such a budget, but closer and closer each time. This is enough to understand the hopelessness of the situation. Shots with a couple in the water and parties on the shore alternate very successfully. Everyone is having fun and is not even aware of the tragedy unfolding at the same time. The actors play great, especially given the shooting conditions. An excellent film about how people find themselves helpless and defenseless on the open sea.

Uses a minimalist budget, a vast outdoor setting, a very small cast, and a narrative that meticulously builds a pervasive sense of dread without giving too much away

I thought the "meat" of this movie was fair, it was the parts leading up to it and the ending that were awful. This might have done a lot better as a much shorter film. Even at only an hour and 20 minutes, it was about 30 minutes to long.The character development is *weak*. If you're not going to bother doing some real character development, don't do it at all. For the first 25 minutes, I could have been watching my girlfriend and I go through our daily ups and downs. If I wanted to watch that, I'd just video tape any random couple for a day and have all the footage I needed. The acting was fair at best. The chemistry between these two never worked for me. The bedroom scene was really a mystery to me. Here's our lovely female lead, nude in bed. Boyfriend jumps in, they kiss, she wonders aloud if she's in the mood, they kiss, she decides she's not in the mood but wants to talk. He rolls over and they go to bed. I very much felt the only reason scenes like this were in the movie was to make it long enough to turn into a "feature" picture and put in theaters. Some of the deleted scenes reinforce this point as we're subjected to a scene that shows the alarm going off, the characters laying in bed, struggling to wake up, and then a 30 second shot slowly closing in on the ceiling fan. That's right, 30 seconds of ceiling fan action. Dramatic! I thought the ending was hacky as well, as if the writer had no idea how to end this movie. Techncailly, they didn't, as it was based on a true story and the true persons who experienced this are, of course, dead. Boyfriend has bled out from a shark bite inflicted late the previous day. Girlfriend pushes him away and he is quickly devoured by sharks. The last scene shows girlfriend commit suicide by drowning herself. First off...it's hard to drown yourself without weights. The body is naturally buoyant and it would take a heck of a lot willpower to keep from jerking your head above the water. Drowning hurts. A lot. The vast majority of the population would surface to stop the pain.Secondly, how do we know this person committed suicide? Why not show the final image of the girlfriend adrift by herself? For me, that would have been a lot more dramatic than seeing her commit suicide in suspect fashion.Had this movie started as the couple boarded the boat and ended with the camera slowly pulling back from girlfriend, alone in the water, I would have given it 6 stars. Combined with the hackey front "half" of the movie and the cop-out of an ending, I was pretty unsatisfied.

The first time I became aware of "Open Water" was driving home one night in 2003 stuck in the usual traffic jam when i noticed a huge bill board advertising the movie. "Blair witch meets Jaws !" was the slogan above an image of two petrified characters in the ocean with a large shark fin in front of them. Being a big fan of Jaws and having been impressed by the Blair witch project I decided I would see it when released. I was further intrigued when i read the premise for the story. After I finished college i spent some time in, among other places, Cairns, Australia where I have family. There was a great deal of talk about the Outer Edge and the peace core workers Tom and Eileen Lonergan who had disappeared. Armed with all the details I had learnt from the locals in Cairns two years before Open Water was released, this became a must see for me.Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. The movie omitted most of the interesting elements of the real story. You are presented with two unlikable characters who we are given no background to and very little reason to care about what happens to them. More than half of the screen time is devoted to watching the two of them bob up and down in the Ocean.I have read many reviews here that state how fantastic this piece of independent cinema is. I'm afraid I disagree. It is a boring, uninteresting and inaccurate piece of movie making. I have done some diving myself and there are many inaccuracies in the Ocean scenes. To name a couple, sharks do not tend to have the courtesy to wait until you are actually dead before they start consuming you and trying to drown yourself in a wet suit is damn near impossible.This movie would have been so much more interesting if they had incorporated some of the real story into the drama. Did they fake their own deaths? Were their diaries an indication that this was done deliberately? Was the divers message slate with a plea for help genuine or a hoax? Sadly, none of this is included.The real genius of the production was the marketing team that Lions gate films employed to promote the film. The advertising campaign was vast and guaranteed that public interest would be sufficient to make a profit on their investment.When the credits rolled and the lights came up the night i saw this movie, I heard one man behind me shout "Is that it?" which drew great laughter from the rest of the audience. That was the most entertaining part of the whole experience.

While vacationing in Barbados, a married couple (Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis) are left out at sea by their scuba diving boat, leaving them at the mercy of the elements including a few hundred very hungry sharks.Open Water is a love it or hate it type of movie. You will either hate the fact that all they do is float in the middle of the ocean or you will love that idea and enjoy watching the film. For the most part, I enjoyed the movie. It was suspenseful and scary without really being over the top and gory. The fact that the story is based on true events just makes the whole thing scarier. I usually don't really like movies that are "based on true events" since it is usually a cheap gimmick. However, it worked for Open Water and the movie was a little more believable. There were some unrealistic moments but most of the film seemed to be realistic.Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis play the stranded couple and this is their first real starring roles. They both give good performances adding more suspense to the movie. Chris Kentis did a fantastic job at directing. He knows how to get under the viewer's skin. He offers some very intense and scary moments. While there was plenty of suspense, there were a few yawns as well. There were times when nothing was happening and the film was kind of dull.This shouldn't really be surprisingly considering the movie is really just about people floating. It didn't bother me too much since the film is pretty short. Chris Kentis may have done a good job behind the camera but the script is kind of weak. There were too many unrealistic moments that kind of hurt the movie. There were a few nagging plot holes that were hard to ignore. They weren't severe or anything, just a mild distraction from the film. I wished there had been some more action to explain what had happened. However, the director wants the viewer to use his/her imagination. The ending was pretty good and it was different from your typical Hollywood ending. In the end, there are enough chills and thrills to make up for the sluggish pace. Rating 7/10

Open Water is a lame movie that tries to be Jaws, but it just isn't. It starts off with a happy couple going on vacation to some place(can't remember where). But they go there, and they do some stuff and they get on a boat and go scuba diving. They get really far away from the other people and end up getting lost at sea. You'd think someone would notice that they're gone, but no one does. They stay in the water for a few days, but only a few minutes to us. Then, at the end, the couple dies. That's all this movie is. 79 minutes of bad acting and bad EVERYTHING.It's not scary. I think we all knew this wouldn't be as good as Jaws, the shark classic. But it turns out that this isn't even as good as Jaws 3, which isn't that good. Jaws is better, and scarier. And Jaws was made 30 years ago! Ha! Well, I do not recommend this movie. I give Open Water three thumbs down. Three thumbs down. That's pretty bad isn't it?

The terror doesn't come from gruesome shark attacks. So if that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed. This movie strikes a deeper chord than typical blood-and-gore, shock-fest horror movies; and it may be that desensitized viewers who are incapable of genuine human emotion and empathy will not appreciate it. This film is about real psychological, existential terror -- similar to the effect achieved by Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man.

Based on true events, a couple on a holiday in the Caribbean decide to spend the day on a scuba diving trip. But was it the wrong decision? When a miss-count happens on the boat, Susan and Daniel are left behind in the middle of the ocean, with the boat long gone. With all their hopes set on the boat coming back to rescue them, they try to keep themselves safe, especially when sharks start to appear.Made for half a million, starring mainly two people in the ocean from the entire movie, "Open Water" is great for what it has. It's a little gem, fortunately, already seen by a lot of people. This movie isn't for everybody. It's a slow paced movie and it's like that for the entire film. It's best to say if you're a really impatient human being who wants something to happen fast, you aren't going to like this.To explain this film, I'll just say it's terror unfolding within each scene. The scares in here are really quite genuine, although it doesn't have the buckets of gore and violence. I just loved how the movie showed us little to nothing yet had my heart pumping. On top of that, you get real sharks! I also liked the performances by the two main leads, Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis.Overall, if you think you would be bored seeing two people stuck in the ocean for the most part of the movie, you probably shouldn't watch it. I found it very tense, disturbing, and suspenseful with some great performances and some great scares (close to the end, of course). See this if you like a real "horror film," I guess people would call it.

This movie is 81 yawn filled minutes of disappointment. You get to watch two people float around in the water for over an hour, then they die. That is it. It's a 3 minute story that's been stretched beyond its limits. It's just not something that needed to be made. I understand what that situation would be like. Yeah, it would suck. Yeah, I'd be angry. Yeah, I'd be scared. After watching them bob up and down for 45 minutes I don't even care what happens to them. Just finish the movie so I can eat a sandwich. The film failed to make me feel the way the characters felt. Get your fast forward button ready. It will be worth its weight in gold during open water.

An hour ago i finished watching Open Water for the first time and i still cannot stop thinking about it. What a powerful film. I walked away feeling deeply saddened, though somewhat disturbed, yet altogether moved. I am so so glad that Hollywood didn't get a hold of this story and make a typical box office affair of it. The way the movie was shot (on hand-held digital cameras) totally allowed the viewer to feel the same level of desperation as the couple would have been feeling. I truly felt their desperation, the sense of hopelessness was brilliantly conveyed in the film. For once viewers were not given the storyline straight up and were actively involved in unraveling the story the entire film. More movies should leave me feeling effected like this one has. That's what movies are meant to do, they just don't seem to anymore! Congartulations Open Water - you did what so many big-budget thriller/drama films fail to do - you actually got to the viewer.

Chris Kentis directed his second movie, after the Billy Crudup-led disaster that was "Grind", about a couple who misses their boat and has to fend for themselves, contending with sharks, barracudas, puke, diarrhea and lack of food or water. Think of this as a "Blair Witch project", but in the water, better dialog, and you know, actually good. Come to think of it, this isn't like the abysmal Blair Witch film at all. The dialog seems authentic enough, even if the main character's decisions of what to do don't. It kept my attention, and for a low-budget film that's enough for me. Oh and plus Susan Ryan is Hot with a capital H.My Grade: C+ DVD Extras: Commantary with Susan Ryan and Daniel Travis; Second commentary with Chris Kentis and Laura Lau; The Indie Essentials featurette; Making-of; On-location footage; 7 Deleted Scenes; and theatrical Trailer Eye Candy: Susan Ryan shows it all and it's so VERY good

Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis play a busy couple forcing themselves to take some time out to relax. They go to the Caribbean for R & R. Once there they take a scuba diving trip, dive into the water, and then are ...forgotten by the scuba ship. Open Water then chronicles what this couple will endure out at sea. I watch a lot of scary pictures, but this film really affected me a lot more than many I have seen with monsters and blood and whatever else is usually hurled at you in a horror movie. It was downright scary. Much of that is due to the "This really happened in real life" quality the film exudes. It is in fact based on just such an incidence off the coast of Australia. But the frightening aspect also is due in large part to the ordinary nature of the two main characters, everybody else in the film, the simple yet direct direction, and the total lack of "HOLLYWOOD" to be found anywhere. I felt like I could have been Daniel. A film that can make you feel like the possibility even remotely exists for that to happen is working on some level. Open Water works on real fears: negligence, sharks, impending doom, and the horror that sometimes can be wide, wet, empty tracts of nothing but miles and miles of sea water. The meaningless of man can really be measured in those scenes where Daniel and Susan tread for life amidst a background of endless waves with predators all around them. Both Ryan and Travis do very good jobs with this type of material. The director Curtis deserves a lot of praise for his ability to make this whole thing come off so effectively.

Ridiculous! I can't BELIEVE they spent over two years filming this (on weekends and vacation time), and that the actors actually put themselves at risk swimming with actual sharks. Taking that risk for THIS?! ** Here's the spoiler ** What was up with that ending? I wasn't even sure what happened to the man, at first. Directing, editing and "script" on that was completely vague. So it was up to the actress, I suppose, to convey that he had died. (And how idiotic that she'd just push him off, instead of hang onto him / retain his body for a proper funeral / use him for flotation / use his equipment (knife, e.g.) for possible tools of survival). And then when she submerges herself I said, "Is that it? Is she drowning herself? Is she just 'hiding' from sharks?" (Ha!). And then, fade to black. Uhh, yeah. Whatever. Talk about inability to write a scenario and direct with competence! Two more annoying things: 1) That boob shot. It stood out like a sore ..thumb. So glaringly gratuitous. I felt embarrassed for the actress because it was so unnecessary, despite what the Producer said in the optional Commentary on the DVD. Which brings me to annoying thing #2): The optional Commentary on the DVD: the Producer (the director's wife) must be one of the most irritating people in the biz. In one breath she's trying to be 'deep' about the bland story, and in the next she's "selling" this entire cheap project as something stupendous. Shut up!Fade to black.

One wonders if Open Water would even exist if it were not for The Blair Witch Project. The film, photographed with digital video cameras, using actors with limited professional experience, and staged in a very documentary style, owes a lot to the old Witch. But the debt is very easily repaid. Despite some weak scenes towards the beginning of the film, Open Water proves to be a rather tense, involving experience.The film's plot is rather unsophisticated: Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis) are going on a vacation together on a warm Caribbean island. It begins innocently enough: swimming, shopping, fooling around in the hotel. Then the two decide to go scuba diving with a charter operation and, through a twist of fate (and some rather poor counting skills by the crew of the boat), the two are accidentally left stranded in the water, in the middle of nowhere. A powerful current moves them along, they spot boats in the distance but don't think they can swim to them, and then they begin to argue. This is all before the sharks begin appearing, leaving the divers with a significant sense of dread.As promised, Open Water is a rather minimalist experience. In the film's early scenes, the amateurish nature of the production is readily apparent. The scenes between the two lovers (it's a bit unclear whether they are married or not) are obviously not being performed by seasoned professionals. Both actors are not terrible, but they are not exactly polished either, taking away some of the sense of disbelief. The digital video photography is also a double edged sword: at times it gives the film a sense of verisimilitude, at others it makes it feel like we are watching something filmed by your buddy who is an aspiring filmmaker with his camcorder on a five dollar budget.Most of these gripes disappear once the divers are stranded alone in the ocean. What seemed like an exercise in minimalist film-making that was quickly becoming mediocre suddenly becomes involving. The film poses a great what if question: what would you do, trapped in the middle of the ocean by yourself, miles from land and with no help in sight. These characters do what probably most of us would do, second guess themselves, panic, allow anger and feelings of guilt take hold of themselves, and begin wishing for a miracle when trouble appears in the form of a shark. Or, in this film's case, multiple sharks. There was a bit of media hoopla when Open Water was released concerning the fact that the actors were filmed in waters with real live sharks, but the material works wonderfully. We really believe these two are in danger and the imagery of sharks in the water hasn't contained this kind of power since Jaws.Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis both had very limited acting resumes before this film, and their early scenes reveal a somewhat amateurish feel to their performances, but the two acquit themselves fairly well in the latter scenes in the water. There, they perform as I believe people probably would in that situation, first with disbelief, then anger, then fear. They may not be perfect, but they get the job done well.The film's strongest sequence is set at night, when the two are surrounded by sharks, with the only lighting we are given are occasional flashes of lightning from a distant storm. The sense of dread is palpable in this scene, and director Chris Kentis should be given credit for assembling a very tense piece of work.Open Water is by no means a masterpiece, it's a little rough around the edges at times, but overall it is a involving piece of cinema that is worth a rent.

WARNING: WILL CONTAIN A SPOILER.... I have never been to a movie that the audience boo'd at the end. The entire movie was very B rated, almost like a cheep porn. The acting was horrible and I can not believe the writers couldn't come up with better lines. This is what I want to know....so please tell me.....How does any one really know the true events of this movie? Could they simply have drowned? They must have taken off their packs. Did they really fight? Did Susan really throw up? How could any wife let her husband just...go away? And what's the deal w/Susan at the end? I feel bad for their families - having to watch a made up story about their love ones. What if Susan & Daniel drowned 15 minutes after the boat left them? CRAPPY MOVIE! SAVE YOUR MONEY!~

What would it be like to trapped in the great outdoors? This movie provides one idea. Left in the ocean due to human error, a married couple must now deal with the consequences.What the makers really did well was capturing the sense of isolation for the couple. A lot of scenes really went out of their way to show the vast expanse of the ocean, which created an effect of the couple being small and insignificant. It serves as a reminder that we might be at the top of the food chain, but that position is not fixed; all it takes is one botched headcount and you are at Mother Nature's mercy.While I classify this as a thriller, this is not a standard one; the conflict is mostly psychological, as the couple tries to keep their hopes up in face of these overwhelming set of circumstances. Filmgoers looking for something big, scary and gory should look elsewhere.

COME ON!!!! My friend and I just got back from the movies and when the movie ended (I was surprised I was still awake), We were waiting for the credits to get up and swear at it! That movie was horrible! The camera was blurry, the acting was really bad, AND DURING THE TRAILER IT SHOWED SCENES NOT EVEN ON THE MOVIE! That is the worst movie I have seen in my life! People in the newspaper gave it 4 1/2 stars out of 5??? Are they on something?******SPOILER******1. She says for him to never let go and she loves him, meanwhile she lets him go and drowns herself leaving the credits to roll and the crowd confused?2. HOW IN THE HELL COULD IT BE PG when it shows the girls boobs and at least saying F**kers and F**k 25 times!3. It says TERRIFYING, BETTER THEN JAWS, AND IT WILL MAKE YOU JUMP OUT OF YOUR SKIN AND OFF YOUR SEAT! The only thing I wanted to do was jump out of my seat and get the hell out of there!!!4. The movies plot started out WAY to early, making no character development and the so called "problems" they had during their lives!5. I agree with people in the other posts saying why would they leave them behind? Even in the end they would do a count and could remember the faces of the 2 lost divers!6. The quote "Better then Jaws" is complete crap! Jaws actually had good shark attacks and a way better plot and meanwhile its like 20 years older! They could of done a way better movie, even if they didn't have enough money, and they wasted a good title! 7. The movie was so boring it seemed like it was 45 minutes long! I could name a ton more bad things about this movie but I'm not going to!8. It was a lot like Blaire Witch Project with the HORRIFIC camera angles and it seemed like the camera man had Parkinson disease or something!Overall, the movie was a complete waste of film, waste of acting, waste of a title, and mostly of all, a waste of my time!

This has to be the angriest line in the entire movie ("We paid to do this!"), uttered in a furious, hopeless growl by Daniel (Daniel Travis) as he and Susan (Blanchard Davis) float and drift aimlessly in the calm waters of the Atlantic after being left behind by their cruise and slowly yet inexorably lose any hope of being rescued by anyone. Because it sums up the way reality becomes a surreal nightmare -- young yuppie couple pay for a vacation getaway in the Caribbean and find themselves being shark bait, and who really is to blame? Them? The crew's carelessness for not doing a name count? They could have gone skiing (no sharks there) and not been stuck in this quandary. What have they done to deserve this? There are no answers to these questions, only open sea and the mounting dangers just below the surface. To know that these dangers are there, but not to see them, is just as bad -- even worse -- than to actually see them. Chris Kentis, thankfully using the less is more approach and shooting the film in an anti-conventional form (no artificial lighting, no backdrops, no CGI sharks, no large water tanks substituting for open sea for close-ups, digital video), creates a visceral experience with this short movie that relies on so much since almost an hour is spent in the water. Never does a moment go by feels like filler: the events feel real, the mounting desperation as Susan and Daniel slowly realize just how dire their situation is feels right (even though sometimes the delivery feels too flat -- but this is perfectly fine, since this is how people actually talk instead of talking in speech), and the timing from when the fake shark head which Daniel ironically sticks his head into in the marketplace, from the mention of sharks about 20 minutes in, to the actual, split-second appearance of a shark's fin and tail 30 minutes in is great and its quiet yet horrifying conclusion in many ways, outdoes JAWS. No swelling music, just the vague, grey outline of the animal beneath the surface, and that alone is enough to create moments of incredible dread, especially in the best sequence in the film: its night sequence, where all we see is what they see, darkness and each other once lightning flashes, drowning their screams and implying another shark attack.However, OPEN WATER is not a movie about fear in itself. It's more about this vast, stomach-turning emptiness of how suddenly meaningless our lives become when put into a (pun intended) fish-out-of-water situation. It's not only knowing that the waters are infested with sharks, but knowing that the end will come.

This movie will not win any awards. At least not for the categories which we've come to know. What it will do is awaken your senses to just how easily a good situation can turn bad. They should create a motion picture award for most realistic storyline. This movie would then be the winner.I found this story disturbing. In such a manner that it raises some of the basic fears we carry around with us. The fact that the movie was shot without a huge budget and relative unknown celebrities, puts it at the level of the everyday person. Many times throughout the story, you could easily place yourself in the shoes of these people. Everyday people, busy with their jobs, looking for a little relaxation in a tropical paradise....sound familiar? As disturbing as this movie is, you must remember that much of it is based on speculation. If you do some research on the real life event, you will find that we really don't know what took place. Regardless, this is one of those pictures for which you should reset your expectations. No glitz or glamour, but a strong dose of reality.

I thought this movie was terrible. There was no build up to any events. The events in the water were not scary nor were they suspenseful. I fast forwarded through a great deal of these because they were too long and boring. I hated the ending and everything about it. I can't believe that someone felt it necessary to make a movie out of the deaths of these two very unfortunate people. I can't believe I wasted that much time of an evening. I am only glad that I didn't go to the theater and watched it I would have really been upset. As it was, the fact that I spent any amount of money on it annoys me but I feel better knowing that I can at least tell others to run away from this movie, run very fast!

A short and sweet gimmick movie about two people who are stranded in the middle of the ocean when their scuba diving boat leaves without them and then face the ordeal of slowly dying (of dehydration and/or exposure) or quickly dying (gobbled up by sharks).The obvious question of course is: can a director pull off a visually interesting film when the bulk of it consists of two people sitting immobile in the water? The answer is yes, mostly. The film does a good job of creating a dreadful feeling in the pit of your stomach, not because we care all that much about these particular people (the characters aren't developed enough or likable enough for that) but because the situation they find themselves in taps into any number of visceral fears that just about anyone could relate to.And kudos to the writer and director for having the guts to go for the grim, nihilistic ending.Grade: B

It really doesn't surprise me that some people don't like this film. After all to truly enjoy Open Water one must open their mind and think. In this day and age that hardly ever happens anymore. Most filmmakers just decide to blow things up and hope that it's enough to entertain their audiences. Society in general has become numb what with the plots just laid out in front of us never questioning or asking us to use our imaginations. Open Water is a film that asks its viewers to place themselves at the heart of the movie; to feel the desperation, the hopelessness and the absolute terrifying ordeal. And for a change the movie is shot in a way that allows the viewer to feel as if truly there. Is it Jaws? No and its not meant to be. Maybe that's where the confusion lays. Open Water is a suspenseful film, excellent at that. If you're someone who actually enjoys figuring out the movie for yourself instead of being told in the first five minutes this is the film for you. Score: A.

First of all congratulations to Chris Kentis for spotting this topic and writing and directing the film. Now you can tell after praising the film maker up front the rest of this review is going to be quite critical! This film unnerved me, it made me feel uncomfortable as well and that's the problem - it should have frightened the absolute living daylights out of me! Because I rate being deserted at sea in shark-infested waters right up there in the scary-stakes with being buried alive. Now I respect Mr Kentis and his collaborators decision to tell the story in a very minimalist way, I guess they considered this story was powerful enough on its own not to require a heavy hand, and I could have agreed with them pre production. But now having seen it I don't think it was. I'm not saying they needed full on John Williams score and masses of special effects but perhaps varying the camera angles a bit more would have worked better.Most of the story is told with the camera in an elevated position looking down on the protagonists, i.e a boat! This means I am divorced from any threat or the action. Couldn't we have got down to eye level more allowing us to feel we were more apart of the story? It was our toes about be chomped off? I'm afraid in the drama stakes this movie never got anymore dramatic than the average TV docu-drama and that's a real shame for after coming up with this concept and creating a half decent script Mr Kentis has missed an opportunity to create a classic.

Open Water might be a bit too low budget for many audience members.But this is a prime example of how budget should not hold back a brilliant concept.This is as realistic as it comes, from the scene in the hotel room where the couple lounge around completely nude (like people do in real life!), to the anxiety and horror of being in the Open Water, alone.This might very well be an underrated masterpiece that has spawned numerous awful sequels.

An excellent example of how a very high-quality survival film can be made for a low budget. The emphasis in the film is on the development of relationships in a couple thrown into the sea. Sharks appear in moments, which is not surprising for such a budget, but closer and closer each time. This is enough to understand the hopelessness of the situation. Shots with a couple in the water and parties on the shore alternate very successfully. Everyone is having fun and is not even aware of the tragedy unfolding at the same time. The actors play great, especially given the shooting conditions. An excellent film about how people find themselves helpless and defenseless on the open sea.

Uses a minimalist budget, a vast outdoor setting, a very small cast, and a narrative that meticulously builds a pervasive sense of dread without giving too much away

I thought the "meat" of this movie was fair, it was the parts leading up to it and the ending that were awful. This might have done a lot better as a much shorter film. Even at only an hour and 20 minutes, it was about 30 minutes to long.The character development is *weak*. If you're not going to bother doing some real character development, don't do it at all. For the first 25 minutes, I could have been watching my girlfriend and I go through our daily ups and downs. If I wanted to watch that, I'd just video tape any random couple for a day and have all the footage I needed. The acting was fair at best. The chemistry between these two never worked for me. The bedroom scene was really a mystery to me. Here's our lovely female lead, nude in bed. Boyfriend jumps in, they kiss, she wonders aloud if she's in the mood, they kiss, she decides she's not in the mood but wants to talk. He rolls over and they go to bed. I very much felt the only reason scenes like this were in the movie was to make it long enough to turn into a "feature" picture and put in theaters. Some of the deleted scenes reinforce this point as we're subjected to a scene that shows the alarm going off, the characters laying in bed, struggling to wake up, and then a 30 second shot slowly closing in on the ceiling fan. That's right, 30 seconds of ceiling fan action. Dramatic! I thought the ending was hacky as well, as if the writer had no idea how to end this movie. Techncailly, they didn't, as it was based on a true story and the true persons who experienced this are, of course, dead. Boyfriend has bled out from a shark bite inflicted late the previous day. Girlfriend pushes him away and he is quickly devoured by sharks. The last scene shows girlfriend commit suicide by drowning herself. First off...it's hard to drown yourself without weights. The body is naturally buoyant and it would take a heck of a lot willpower to keep from jerking your head above the water. Drowning hurts. A lot. The vast majority of the population would surface to stop the pain.Secondly, how do we know this person committed suicide? Why not show the final image of the girlfriend adrift by herself? For me, that would have been a lot more dramatic than seeing her commit suicide in suspect fashion.Had this movie started as the couple boarded the boat and ended with the camera slowly pulling back from girlfriend, alone in the water, I would have given it 6 stars. Combined with the hackey front "half" of the movie and the cop-out of an ending, I was pretty unsatisfied.

Director Chris Kentis and his wife, Laura Lau, are Manhattanites with one previous film to their credit, "Grind."  "Open Water" is a labor of love and a fine exemplar of unflagging commitment and energy.  It took the couple several years to get this Indie flick filmed, screened and - mirabile dictu - caught up in the kind of sudden rapture that allows the real powerhouses of the film industry to boast that they're always looking for that non-studio gem from outsiders just waiting for deserved discovery.Well, they haven't a gem here but it's not a disaster either.  Based on the actual disappearance of an American couple in the Pacific who were scuba diving and were left by their guide boat (a story that has some crime/conspiracy addicts claiming the couple is either still alive somewhere or there was a murder/suicide: take your pick), Kentis and Lau created a similar tale.Newcomers to the movie screen, very pretty Blanchard Ryan plays Susan and Daniel Travis, Daniel.  They're a couple (not clear if they're married but who cares) with a very nice suburban house and good jobs.  Susan's job is a real 24/7 deal causing the couple to have to book a scuba diving vacation in the Caribbean at the last minute - their original and safer plans succumbed to her work priorities.This couple graduated seamlessly and affluently from Yuppiehood to DINK (Double Income-No Kids) status.  So they can afford this great vacation.They dive with about twenty other people.  An SOP exists for making sure that everyone is aboard before the boat departs the area but Susan and Daniel are left high and dry.  Actually low and wet.  Why?  Because that greatest of all universal forces, Negligence, permitted a fatal miscount.What follows is a conversation flick as Daniel and Susan alternately hug and cuddle and then argue.  Daniel starts off giving the not initially worried Susan tips based on his viewing of "Shark Week" and other armchair adventure cable shows.  But as the situation becomes more serious with no sign of rescue the couple cathartically exhumes the  domestic grievances that are as common as the cold for young professionals.The sharks (actually corralled by unseen herders) make regular appearances. The excellent sound system in the Loew's Lincoln Square theater was augmented today by frequent cries from at least three viewers strategically seated around the perimeter of the audience.This isn't an anti-shark movie.  It's a pale story but the two leads give it their best.  Susan's Dramamine wears off soon, she announces.  Actually it's at the point where some motion sickness-sensitive moviegoers might well need the little pill themselves as the digital cameras rise and fall, rise and fall, rise and fall.Perhaps because Ryan and Travis are so inexperienced as actors there's a certain innocent believability in their behavior and conversation.Blanchard Ryan said in an interview that she didn't mind doing a nude scene early in the movie because she thought no one would see it.  Wrong.  By word of mouth and with some extravagant reviews this movie is packing them in, at least here in Gotham.Digital Video movies are still clearly inferior to those shot on standard stock.  When the story and characters are really interesting, as in "Pieces of April," the washed out quality can be ignored.  Not here as the ocean swells rise and fall, rise and fall, rise and fall.6/10

The first time I became aware of "Open Water" was driving home one night in 2003 stuck in the usual traffic jam when i noticed a huge bill board advertising the movie. "Blair witch meets Jaws !" was the slogan above an image of two petrified characters in the ocean with a large shark fin in front of them. Being a big fan of Jaws and having been impressed by the Blair witch project I decided I would see it when released. I was further intrigued when i read the premise for the story. After I finished college i spent some time in, among other places, Cairns, Australia where I have family. There was a great deal of talk about the Outer Edge and the peace core workers Tom and Eileen Lonergan who had disappeared. Armed with all the details I had learnt from the locals in Cairns two years before Open Water was released, this became a must see for me.Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. The movie omitted most of the interesting elements of the real story. You are presented with two unlikable characters who we are given no background to and very little reason to care about what happens to them. More than half of the screen time is devoted to watching the two of them bob up and down in the Ocean.I have read many reviews here that state how fantastic this piece of independent cinema is. I'm afraid I disagree. It is a boring, uninteresting and inaccurate piece of movie making. I have done some diving myself and there are many inaccuracies in the Ocean scenes. To name a couple, sharks do not tend to have the courtesy to wait until you are actually dead before they start consuming you and trying to drown yourself in a wet suit is damn near impossible.This movie would have been so much more interesting if they had incorporated some of the real story into the drama. Did they fake their own deaths? Were their diaries an indication that this was done deliberately? Was the divers message slate with a plea for help genuine or a hoax? Sadly, none of this is included.The real genius of the production was the marketing team that Lions gate films employed to promote the film. The advertising campaign was vast and guaranteed that public interest would be sufficient to make a profit on their investment.When the credits rolled and the lights came up the night i saw this movie, I heard one man behind me shout "Is that it?" which drew great laughter from the rest of the audience. That was the most entertaining part of the whole experience.

While vacationing in Barbados, a married couple (Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis) are left out at sea by their scuba diving boat, leaving them at the mercy of the elements including a few hundred very hungry sharks.Open Water is a love it or hate it type of movie. You will either hate the fact that all they do is float in the middle of the ocean or you will love that idea and enjoy watching the film. For the most part, I enjoyed the movie. It was suspenseful and scary without really being over the top and gory. The fact that the story is based on true events just makes the whole thing scarier. I usually don't really like movies that are "based on true events" since it is usually a cheap gimmick. However, it worked for Open Water and the movie was a little more believable. There were some unrealistic moments but most of the film seemed to be realistic.Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis play the stranded couple and this is their first real starring roles. They both give good performances adding more suspense to the movie. Chris Kentis did a fantastic job at directing. He knows how to get under the viewer's skin. He offers some very intense and scary moments. While there was plenty of suspense, there were a few yawns as well. There were times when nothing was happening and the film was kind of dull.This shouldn't really be surprisingly considering the movie is really just about people floating. It didn't bother me too much since the film is pretty short. Chris Kentis may have done a good job behind the camera but the script is kind of weak. There were too many unrealistic moments that kind of hurt the movie. There were a few nagging plot holes that were hard to ignore. They weren't severe or anything, just a mild distraction from the film. I wished there had been some more action to explain what had happened. However, the director wants the viewer to use his/her imagination. The ending was pretty good and it was different from your typical Hollywood ending. In the end, there are enough chills and thrills to make up for the sluggish pace. Rating 7/10

Open Water is a lame movie that tries to be Jaws, but it just isn't. It starts off with a happy couple going on vacation to some place(can't remember where). But they go there, and they do some stuff and they get on a boat and go scuba diving. They get really far away from the other people and end up getting lost at sea. You'd think someone would notice that they're gone, but no one does. They stay in the water for a few days, but only a few minutes to us. Then, at the end, the couple dies. That's all this movie is. 79 minutes of bad acting and bad EVERYTHING.It's not scary. I think we all knew this wouldn't be as good as Jaws, the shark classic. But it turns out that this isn't even as good as Jaws 3, which isn't that good. Jaws is better, and scarier. And Jaws was made 30 years ago! Ha! Well, I do not recommend this movie. I give Open Water three thumbs down. Three thumbs down. That's pretty bad isn't it?

The terror doesn't come from gruesome shark attacks. So if that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed. This movie strikes a deeper chord than typical blood-and-gore, shock-fest horror movies; and it may be that desensitized viewers who are incapable of genuine human emotion and empathy will not appreciate it. This film is about real psychological, existential terror -- similar to the effect achieved by Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man.

Based on true events, a couple on a holiday in the Caribbean decide to spend the day on a scuba diving trip. But was it the wrong decision? When a miss-count happens on the boat, Susan and Daniel are left behind in the middle of the ocean, with the boat long gone. With all their hopes set on the boat coming back to rescue them, they try to keep themselves safe, especially when sharks start to appear.Made for half a million, starring mainly two people in the ocean from the entire movie, "Open Water" is great for what it has. It's a little gem, fortunately, already seen by a lot of people. This movie isn't for everybody. It's a slow paced movie and it's like that for the entire film. It's best to say if you're a really impatient human being who wants something to happen fast, you aren't going to like this.To explain this film, I'll just say it's terror unfolding within each scene. The scares in here are really quite genuine, although it doesn't have the buckets of gore and violence. I just loved how the movie showed us little to nothing yet had my heart pumping. On top of that, you get real sharks! I also liked the performances by the two main leads, Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis.Overall, if you think you would be bored seeing two people stuck in the ocean for the most part of the movie, you probably shouldn't watch it. I found it very tense, disturbing, and suspenseful with some great performances and some great scares (close to the end, of course). See this if you like a real "horror film," I guess people would call it.

This movie is 81 yawn filled minutes of disappointment. You get to watch two people float around in the water for over an hour, then they die. That is it. It's a 3 minute story that's been stretched beyond its limits. It's just not something that needed to be made. I understand what that situation would be like. Yeah, it would suck. Yeah, I'd be angry. Yeah, I'd be scared. After watching them bob up and down for 45 minutes I don't even care what happens to them. Just finish the movie so I can eat a sandwich. The film failed to make me feel the way the characters felt. Get your fast forward button ready. It will be worth its weight in gold during open water.

An hour ago i finished watching Open Water for the first time and i still cannot stop thinking about it. What a powerful film. I walked away feeling deeply saddened, though somewhat disturbed, yet altogether moved. I am so so glad that Hollywood didn't get a hold of this story and make a typical box office affair of it. The way the movie was shot (on hand-held digital cameras) totally allowed the viewer to feel the same level of desperation as the couple would have been feeling. I truly felt their desperation, the sense of hopelessness was brilliantly conveyed in the film. For once viewers were not given the storyline straight up and were actively involved in unraveling the story the entire film. More movies should leave me feeling effected like this one has. That's what movies are meant to do, they just don't seem to anymore! Congartulations Open Water - you did what so many big-budget thriller/drama films fail to do - you actually got to the viewer.

Chris Kentis directed his second movie, after the Billy Crudup-led disaster that was "Grind", about a couple who misses their boat and has to fend for themselves, contending with sharks, barracudas, puke, diarrhea and lack of food or water. Think of this as a "Blair Witch project", but in the water, better dialog, and you know, actually good. Come to think of it, this isn't like the abysmal Blair Witch film at all. The dialog seems authentic enough, even if the main character's decisions of what to do don't. It kept my attention, and for a low-budget film that's enough for me. Oh and plus Susan Ryan is Hot with a capital H.My Grade: C+ DVD Extras: Commantary with Susan Ryan and Daniel Travis; Second commentary with Chris Kentis and Laura Lau; The Indie Essentials featurette; Making-of; On-location footage; 7 Deleted Scenes; and theatrical Trailer Eye Candy: Susan Ryan shows it all and it's so VERY good

Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis play a busy couple forcing themselves to take some time out to relax. They go to the Caribbean for R & R. Once there they take a scuba diving trip, dive into the water, and then are ...forgotten by the scuba ship. Open Water then chronicles what this couple will endure out at sea. I watch a lot of scary pictures, but this film really affected me a lot more than many I have seen with monsters and blood and whatever else is usually hurled at you in a horror movie. It was downright scary. Much of that is due to the "This really happened in real life" quality the film exudes. It is in fact based on just such an incidence off the coast of Australia. But the frightening aspect also is due in large part to the ordinary nature of the two main characters, everybody else in the film, the simple yet direct direction, and the total lack of "HOLLYWOOD" to be found anywhere. I felt like I could have been Daniel. A film that can make you feel like the possibility even remotely exists for that to happen is working on some level. Open Water works on real fears: negligence, sharks, impending doom, and the horror that sometimes can be wide, wet, empty tracts of nothing but miles and miles of sea water. The meaningless of man can really be measured in those scenes where Daniel and Susan tread for life amidst a background of endless waves with predators all around them. Both Ryan and Travis do very good jobs with this type of material. The director Curtis deserves a lot of praise for his ability to make this whole thing come off so effectively.

Ridiculous! I can't BELIEVE they spent over two years filming this (on weekends and vacation time), and that the actors actually put themselves at risk swimming with actual sharks. Taking that risk for THIS?! ** Here's the spoiler ** What was up with that ending? I wasn't even sure what happened to the man, at first. Directing, editing and "script" on that was completely vague. So it was up to the actress, I suppose, to convey that he had died. (And how idiotic that she'd just push him off, instead of hang onto him / retain his body for a proper funeral / use him for flotation / use his equipment (knife, e.g.) for possible tools of survival). And then when she submerges herself I said, "Is that it? Is she drowning herself? Is she just 'hiding' from sharks?" (Ha!). And then, fade to black. Uhh, yeah. Whatever. Talk about inability to write a scenario and direct with competence! Two more annoying things: 1) That boob shot. It stood out like a sore ..thumb. So glaringly gratuitous. I felt embarrassed for the actress because it was so unnecessary, despite what the Producer said in the optional Commentary on the DVD. Which brings me to annoying thing #2): The optional Commentary on the DVD: the Producer (the director's wife) must be one of the most irritating people in the biz. In one breath she's trying to be 'deep' about the bland story, and in the next she's "selling" this entire cheap project as something stupendous. Shut up!Fade to black.

One wonders if Open Water would even exist if it were not for The Blair Witch Project. The film, photographed with digital video cameras, using actors with limited professional experience, and staged in a very documentary style, owes a lot to the old Witch. But the debt is very easily repaid. Despite some weak scenes towards the beginning of the film, Open Water proves to be a rather tense, involving experience.The film's plot is rather unsophisticated: Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis) are going on a vacation together on a warm Caribbean island. It begins innocently enough: swimming, shopping, fooling around in the hotel. Then the two decide to go scuba diving with a charter operation and, through a twist of fate (and some rather poor counting skills by the crew of the boat), the two are accidentally left stranded in the water, in the middle of nowhere. A powerful current moves them along, they spot boats in the distance but don't think they can swim to them, and then they begin to argue. This is all before the sharks begin appearing, leaving the divers with a significant sense of dread.As promised, Open Water is a rather minimalist experience. In the film's early scenes, the amateurish nature of the production is readily apparent. The scenes between the two lovers (it's a bit unclear whether they are married or not) are obviously not being performed by seasoned professionals. Both actors are not terrible, but they are not exactly polished either, taking away some of the sense of disbelief. The digital video photography is also a double edged sword: at times it gives the film a sense of verisimilitude, at others it makes it feel like we are watching something filmed by your buddy who is an aspiring filmmaker with his camcorder on a five dollar budget.Most of these gripes disappear once the divers are stranded alone in the ocean. What seemed like an exercise in minimalist film-making that was quickly becoming mediocre suddenly becomes involving. The film poses a great what if question: what would you do, trapped in the middle of the ocean by yourself, miles from land and with no help in sight. These characters do what probably most of us would do, second guess themselves, panic, allow anger and feelings of guilt take hold of themselves, and begin wishing for a miracle when trouble appears in the form of a shark. Or, in this film's case, multiple sharks. There was a bit of media hoopla when Open Water was released concerning the fact that the actors were filmed in waters with real live sharks, but the material works wonderfully. We really believe these two are in danger and the imagery of sharks in the water hasn't contained this kind of power since Jaws.Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis both had very limited acting resumes before this film, and their early scenes reveal a somewhat amateurish feel to their performances, but the two acquit themselves fairly well in the latter scenes in the water. There, they perform as I believe people probably would in that situation, first with disbelief, then anger, then fear. They may not be perfect, but they get the job done well.The film's strongest sequence is set at night, when the two are surrounded by sharks, with the only lighting we are given are occasional flashes of lightning from a distant storm. The sense of dread is palpable in this scene, and director Chris Kentis should be given credit for assembling a very tense piece of work.Open Water is by no means a masterpiece, it's a little rough around the edges at times, but overall it is a involving piece of cinema that is worth a rent.

WARNING: WILL CONTAIN A SPOILER.... I have never been to a movie that the audience boo'd at the end. The entire movie was very B rated, almost like a cheep porn. The acting was horrible and I can not believe the writers couldn't come up with better lines. This is what I want to know....so please tell me.....How does any one really know the true events of this movie? Could they simply have drowned? They must have taken off their packs. Did they really fight? Did Susan really throw up? How could any wife let her husband just...go away? And what's the deal w/Susan at the end? I feel bad for their families - having to watch a made up story about their love ones. What if Susan & Daniel drowned 15 minutes after the boat left them? CRAPPY MOVIE! SAVE YOUR MONEY!~

What would it be like to trapped in the great outdoors? This movie provides one idea. Left in the ocean due to human error, a married couple must now deal with the consequences.What the makers really did well was capturing the sense of isolation for the couple. A lot of scenes really went out of their way to show the vast expanse of the ocean, which created an effect of the couple being small and insignificant. It serves as a reminder that we might be at the top of the food chain, but that position is not fixed; all it takes is one botched headcount and you are at Mother Nature's mercy.While I classify this as a thriller, this is not a standard one; the conflict is mostly psychological, as the couple tries to keep their hopes up in face of these overwhelming set of circumstances. Filmgoers looking for something big, scary and gory should look elsewhere.

COME ON!!!! My friend and I just got back from the movies and when the movie ended (I was surprised I was still awake), We were waiting for the credits to get up and swear at it! That movie was horrible! The camera was blurry, the acting was really bad, AND DURING THE TRAILER IT SHOWED SCENES NOT EVEN ON THE MOVIE! That is the worst movie I have seen in my life! People in the newspaper gave it 4 1/2 stars out of 5??? Are they on something?******SPOILER******1. She says for him to never let go and she loves him, meanwhile she lets him go and drowns herself leaving the credits to roll and the crowd confused?2. HOW IN THE HELL COULD IT BE PG when it shows the girls boobs and at least saying F**kers and F**k 25 times!3. It says TERRIFYING, BETTER THEN JAWS, AND IT WILL MAKE YOU JUMP OUT OF YOUR SKIN AND OFF YOUR SEAT! The only thing I wanted to do was jump out of my seat and get the hell out of there!!!4. The movies plot started out WAY to early, making no character development and the so called "problems" they had during their lives!5. I agree with people in the other posts saying why would they leave them behind? Even in the end they would do a count and could remember the faces of the 2 lost divers!6. The quote "Better then Jaws" is complete crap! Jaws actually had good shark attacks and a way better plot and meanwhile its like 20 years older! They could of done a way better movie, even if they didn't have enough money, and they wasted a good title! 7. The movie was so boring it seemed like it was 45 minutes long! I could name a ton more bad things about this movie but I'm not going to!8. It was a lot like Blaire Witch Project with the HORRIFIC camera angles and it seemed like the camera man had Parkinson disease or something!Overall, the movie was a complete waste of film, waste of acting, waste of a title, and mostly of all, a waste of my time!

This has to be the angriest line in the entire movie ("We paid to do this!"), uttered in a furious, hopeless growl by Daniel (Daniel Travis) as he and Susan (Blanchard Davis) float and drift aimlessly in the calm waters of the Atlantic after being left behind by their cruise and slowly yet inexorably lose any hope of being rescued by anyone. Because it sums up the way reality becomes a surreal nightmare -- young yuppie couple pay for a vacation getaway in the Caribbean and find themselves being shark bait, and who really is to blame? Them? The crew's carelessness for not doing a name count? They could have gone skiing (no sharks there) and not been stuck in this quandary. What have they done to deserve this? There are no answers to these questions, only open sea and the mounting dangers just below the surface. To know that these dangers are there, but not to see them, is just as bad -- even worse -- than to actually see them. Chris Kentis, thankfully using the less is more approach and shooting the film in an anti-conventional form (no artificial lighting, no backdrops, no CGI sharks, no large water tanks substituting for open sea for close-ups, digital video), creates a visceral experience with this short movie that relies on so much since almost an hour is spent in the water. Never does a moment go by feels like filler: the events feel real, the mounting desperation as Susan and Daniel slowly realize just how dire their situation is feels right (even though sometimes the delivery feels too flat -- but this is perfectly fine, since this is how people actually talk instead of talking in speech), and the timing from when the fake shark head which Daniel ironically sticks his head into in the marketplace, from the mention of sharks about 20 minutes in, to the actual, split-second appearance of a shark's fin and tail 30 minutes in is great and its quiet yet horrifying conclusion in many ways, outdoes JAWS. No swelling music, just the vague, grey outline of the animal beneath the surface, and that alone is enough to create moments of incredible dread, especially in the best sequence in the film: its night sequence, where all we see is what they see, darkness and each other once lightning flashes, drowning their screams and implying another shark attack.However, OPEN WATER is not a movie about fear in itself. It's more about this vast, stomach-turning emptiness of how suddenly meaningless our lives become when put into a (pun intended) fish-out-of-water situation. It's not only knowing that the waters are infested with sharks, but knowing that the end will come.

This movie will not win any awards. At least not for the categories which we've come to know. What it will do is awaken your senses to just how easily a good situation can turn bad. They should create a motion picture award for most realistic storyline. This movie would then be the winner.I found this story disturbing. In such a manner that it raises some of the basic fears we carry around with us. The fact that the movie was shot without a huge budget and relative unknown celebrities, puts it at the level of the everyday person. Many times throughout the story, you could easily place yourself in the shoes of these people. Everyday people, busy with their jobs, looking for a little relaxation in a tropical paradise....sound familiar? As disturbing as this movie is, you must remember that much of it is based on speculation. If you do some research on the real life event, you will find that we really don't know what took place. Regardless, this is one of those pictures for which you should reset your expectations. No glitz or glamour, but a strong dose of reality.

I thought this movie was terrible. There was no build up to any events. The events in the water were not scary nor were they suspenseful. I fast forwarded through a great deal of these because they were too long and boring. I hated the ending and everything about it. I can't believe that someone felt it necessary to make a movie out of the deaths of these two very unfortunate people. I can't believe I wasted that much time of an evening. I am only glad that I didn't go to the theater and watched it I would have really been upset. As it was, the fact that I spent any amount of money on it annoys me but I feel better knowing that I can at least tell others to run away from this movie, run very fast!
