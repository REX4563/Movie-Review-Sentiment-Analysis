Just as good the original, in my opinion. Any sequel-slack was ironed out with Dustin Hoffman's sidesplitting performance. I'm really surprised to see so many people find this an unworthy sequel... it's more of what made the original funny with just enough additions to keep it fresh.

Firmly part of the circle of trust, Greg Focker is planning his marriage to Dina and has put off a big family get together for as long as he can. With no further excuses, Greg and Dina join Pam and Jack as they take their RV down to Florida to meet the Focker family. With an eye very much on his bloodline, Jack is keen to judge his future son-in-law by his parents, which spells problems when he finds himself living with two very liberal and touchy-feely Fockers.I'm in my thirties now and it probably is not very impressive that I can put words together in a basic sentence. Whereas for a two year old it might be a real surprise if they were to discuss their opinions on political matters as such with you. What is the difference? Well it is simply one of expectation. Coming to the subject of films, expectation can often make or break a film, with perhaps a poor Pauly Shore movie being better received by viewers than a poor Spielberg film partly because you expect that standard from the former but more from the latter. So it does help this film that with the very title you are informed that you are not about to witness the sharpest of comedies.With this in mind I went in with a forgiving eye, just hoping for laughs but I was not really prepared for how most of the film is unimaginative and base. In the first film we had Greg contrast with stern father Jack and hilarity ensues; here we have the same setup again but this time Greg is replaced as a device by his parents. What this means is that the film essentially aims at the same low targets as the first film and mostly hits them. To avoiding being too boorish on this subject I will admit that moments are funny and that the casting was a nice try but mostly I just found it obvious and dull. Toilet humour, a retread of the CIA stuff and so on supposedly provide the comedy while the drama is the same superficial relationship stuff as before.The cast mostly do their best to try and lift it. Stiller mugs along well enough but the real fun (such as it is) comes from De Niro and Hoffman. The former more or less just does his stuff again but is enjoyable enough, while the latter is at least having fun with a silly character. Streisand and Polo have lesser roles but still have a bit of fun, while poor Danner is just a plot device to try and the give the film some sort of centre. Cameos from Wilson and Nelson don't add much to proceedings and don't even get me starting on the annoying Pickren twins who are not only irritating but made more irritating by the way the film overuses them, apparently in the belief that "Little Jack" is funny and/or cute when really he is neither. Roach's direction is nothing short of pedestrian  even the choice of theme music is obvious and easy.Overall then this is a film that people who really liked the first film will enjoy. Those that just "liked" it may find that they didn't like it enough to watch it twice, which is what is happening here. The cast play it up as much as they can but really this is just an extension of the original idea done bigger but to lesser effect.

'Meet The Fockers (2004)' may be similar in premise to its predecessor, but it feels distinct enough to work as a sequel and is the natural extension of the series' core concept. Pitting in-laws against in-laws is a solid idea, especially when you have a cast as good as this. I mean, who doesn't want to see De Niro get body slammed by Hoffman? The picture is a good time throughout. It amps up the slapstick ever-so-slightly but it still remains relatively grounded and relatable. It's properly funny, too; it may actually be funnier than the first flick. Overall, it's a solid comedy with memorable characters and classic comedic beats. It's really enjoyable. 7/10

Gliding on the good graces of its predecessor, this new installment has very little to showcase in the way of ground breaking comedy. Not that anyone would expect a sequel to 'Meet the Parents' as being a 'departure film' or a film that would ever titillate its audience with anything close to resembling an 'over the line' type of comedy. No, this film is just a very safe and predictable sequel.This sequel force feeds us the chronic Ben Stiller humiliation angle scene after scene. Adding to the comedic clockwork, the producer and or director (or whatever moron in charge), decided to work in the 'baby genius' sub plot into every 7th minute of the film. As if that wasn't enough dumbing down, we're all supposed to be delighted by the dog and cat show that takes place inside DeNiro's 'home on wheels'. The fact that the punch line to this dog and cat chase joke is predicated on one of the animals landing inside the toilet, seems an appropriate place, the proper level if you will, where this film seems most at home.Infants that are more intelligent than adults, cats that are smarter than dogs, how could this film succeed? Well, it can't succeed. However, I have to admit to one thing about this film being good. The performances of Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman were good. I was surprised to see a return to comic form from Barbara Streisand. She really should have been making comedy/musicals these past few years...er...decades. Comedy really suits her. Both her performance and Hoffman's are surprisingly good.Not to take anything away from DeNiro who is also likable, but I was more interested in the 'wacky' hi-jinks between Streisand and Hoffman.Here's the thing. The movie is enjoyable, but I rolled my eyes way too much for me to consider this a great comedy. It's a comedy that is very much by the numbers, for the numbers.If you don't mind a comedy that works down to Mall level, where you can see the jokes coming, then watch it on DVD.I would have given this movie a 5/10, but Streisand and Hoffman were a pleasant enough surprise. I didn't hate this movie, I just didn't like it all that much.

I beg to disagree with most of the critics on this one. I actually liked this movie a little better than 'Meet the Parents', and it is very rare for me to prefer a sequel to the original. There was some good acting in this movie, which is no wonder given the caliber of the cast. Make no mistake, this was definitely not a masterpiece, the script could have been better and the last 20 minutes of the film are a little overdone and cheesy, but all in all a decent, entertaining movie.One thing I found to be a little disturbing about this film is the message it sends, especially to the younger audience: 'It is wrong to be straight, to have strong principles and self-discipline (the Byrnes), whereas it is proper to have no inhibitions, no discipline, no job (somehow everybody is rich anyway) and the world is just a happy merry-go-round (the Fockers). Even coming from liberal Hollywood, this is still wrong.

I think -yes.I am not a big fan of sequels, toilet humor, and little dogs humping everything that moves, overdone baby jokes, "Fockered" jokes, and Ben Stiller. Barbra Streisand is not on my list of the favorite actors, either. But I saw "Meet the Fockers", I laughed out loud, I liked it a lot and I may see it again when it comes to cable or DVD. Dustin Hoffman was hilarious  wild and crazy; together with Streisand they made a great team. Streisand was very funny as a Jewish Mama (I am dying to say Mother Focker  but it's been said hundreds times already) - Sex Therapist for octogenarians. They were the best things about the movie, and it was enough for me to spend very nice two hours (my husband and my son enjoyed it, too. Actually, it's been quite some time since I saw my husband laughing so hard at the movies).

I've been wanting to see Meet the Fockers ever since I heard it was coming out to theaters since I loved Meet the Parents. After hearing good reviews and how hilarious it was, I finally decided to rent it. To my viewing, I thought the movie was overrated. I had laughs in the film and I did like the characters besides the little kid, but I didn't have enough which I was hoping for. There were scenes that were stupid and just shouldn't be in the film. I mean I did have laughs and I loved the football and shot injections scenes but there wasn't enough hilarious parts to entertain me. Overall, a decent sequel with a few laughs but not enough to qualify to its prequel. This could be a letdown to Meet the Parents fans.Hedeen's Outlook: 6/10 ** C-

"Meet the Fockers" sounds like "Meet the f-u-u-". Oops! Can't say that because of FCC guidelines. Just the same, the title pretty much describes the level of the humor in this Ben Stiller comedy. But that's redundant because it IS a Ben Stiller movie. Clearly my expectations for this movie were not high and, maybe because of that, I found "Meet the Fockers" quite funny.Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie for everyone. First off, the writers did not miss a single opportunity to play off of the name "Focker". It's silly and gets a little old but it somehow works with the other repetitious low-down gags.Focker is the family name for Greg (Focker), Ben Stiller. The funniest Fockers, however, (now I'm doing it) are Greg's parents Bernie and Roz, a loose and liberal Florida hippy couple still living in the last century and enjoying every minute of it. Dustin Hoffman, as Bernie displays a previously unrevealed talent for over the top comedy. Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie, is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker, reminiscent of the "zaftig" Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.Greg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiancée's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiancée Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby low-brow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren, two adorable twins playing Little Jack.So, go low, go loose -- or don't go at all -- but if you like Ben Stiller, go see "Meet the Fockers". Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long. Rated a B+.

All in all, not a bad film entertainment wise however I expected something smarter with more humor and execution then there was.Seems Deniro's character lost most of his appeal as well as the whole film turning more into a, "It's OK...they really liked these characters and situation so much, we don't have to work on it as hard and tons of people will still fill the box office" kinda film.Dustin Hoffman was the most talented of the players and I'm not particularly a fan of his and he entertained me more. Barbra... she should have pick a different film because she came off like a dusty IL' sports car with flat tires and cobwebs yet, no matter how dilapidated it looks, underneath you still believes there's a sports car in there somewhere but it is what ya see, if ya know what I'm talking about.We could have used Stiller stepping it up to keep things really interesting and pick up the slack yet they wrote him a bit toward the back and thats too bad.Just with all the talent and pull they had behind this to make it 'really' funny and entertaining, you'd think they would have. Yet a gun with no bullets is still just a hunk of metal. Naw, they weren't shooting blanks yet the powder was a bit too wet for me.Most of you will probably be happy saying your money was spent well, yet I believe those more hardcore watchers not wanting just a cookie cutter production will be disappointed a bit with the results.6.5 outta 10

Meeting the Parents of your girlfriend can be stressful enough. But having her parents meet yours can sometimes be a recipe for disaster, something Greg Focker finds to his peril; when both sets of parents meet on the eve of his wedding. Made after the success of Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers carries on where the last film left off, with Greg delivering babies while his stuffy future father in laws delivers ultimatums, both with memorable results. Of course Greg is now finally in "The Circle of Trust" a circle that is headed by Jack, Greg's uptight future father in law, retired from the CIA, yet still firmly attached to his former profession. Meanwhile Greg's own parents are laid back and free with their emotions, his mother being a sex therapist and his father a house husband. Knowing Jack's conservative ways Greg is delighted but terrified at his fiancés news that they are going to have a baby. Worried of Jacks reaction, things get worse when Greg's old teenage crush reappears, along with a 15 year old son who is a dead ringer for Greg and, as far as Jack's concerned, a prime contender for a DNA test . Meet the Fockers is based purely in the realm of a one joke movie (i.e. the family's name) and so has the longevity of one (i.e. very short) The main problems with the film is the heartbreaking (from a film fans point of view) sight of Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand all participating in a film that Benny Hill would have passed at. Streisand, the powerhouse all singing and acting legend, is here reduced to teaching senior citizens how to have better sex, something I could have lived without seeing. Hoffman is clearly having fun, although quite unaware that the audience isn't. His scenes with De Niro have a chemistry, but the scenes themselves do little to their reputations. One scene with Hoffman sitting on a toilet and De Niro in the shower waiting for him to "finish" really felt like an all time low, and when Hoffman flushed I hoped their careers wasn't going down with it. One high point is the appearance of Owen Wilson (Stiller's Hutch to his Starsky) who shows up at the end, but by that time I was too busy sawing through my wrists. Meet the Fockers has an incredible waste of exceptional talent, and that my friends is no laughing matter.

I just saw this movie yesterday and I was appalled at it. All of the humor in this movie is dirty, juvenile trash, with nothing the least bit clever or unique. The humor of this entire movie is every bit as shallow as the Focker/F***er pun that the title implies. It was particularly sad to see talented actors such as Robert Deniro and Dustin Hoffman try hopelessly to restart their now-pathetic careers with this sub-standard vehicle for Ben Stiller (who keeps repeating his "There's Something About Mary" role). The whole situation between Robert Deniro's character and the little baby nephew was just tedious and unfunny, and the fact that the movie tries to generate laughs by showing a baby picking up on foul language from others shows how low the writers went for humor. And Barbra Streisand is just outright annoying. Overall, this movie is just a jumble of desperate toilet humor, and sex jokes, and is a complete disgrace.

I am of mixed minds when it comes to Barbra Streisand (see my long,involved screed about "The Mirror Has Two Faces"), but I will readily admit two things in her favor: the woman can sing the *ss off of a Broadway show tune, and the woman can play screwball comedy to perfection. That's why I like "Meet The Fockers" so much. Yes, the film is actually fairly sweet and sympathetic within its "comedic farce" settings. Yes, Robert DeNiro is compelling yet funny as an ex-CIA man who is wrapped a little too tight. Yes, there are plenty of gross-out jokes, and plenty of silly word plays and puns on the Focker family name. Yes, Dustin Hoffman is great in a very broadly played role (watching his character practice Capoeira is a hoot). But the real pleasure here is watching Streisand do what she does best on screen: real screwball comedy. Not romantic comedy ("Mirror Has Two Faces", which was for fans only), not romantic drama ("A Star Is Born"), not all those other genres she tackled because she wanted to be Taken Seriously...but simple, funny comedy in which she puts aside her need to be regarded as A Great Beauty (30 Years Younger Than Her Real Age) and simply plays a somewhat dippy, marvelously warm and funny older mother. She is every bit of Hoffman's and DeNiro's match, and she almost totally overwhelms poor Stiller and the other female leads. She's great. She's funny. She's adorable. She's doing what she does best. The movie is worth seeing just to see her (and Hoffman) in action. If you are any kind of fan of her early, funny movies ("What's Up Doc?", "Funny Girl"), you should check out "Meet The Fockers". You will find much to enjoy, along with a pretty fair family comedy.

Gaylord Focker and Pam Byrnes are ready to be married, but first they think their parents ought to meet. Picking up where the first film left off, we now have another set of parents just as quirky as the first, giving us double the insanity. For fans of the first film, this should be a treat! For me, I'm getting my fill of Ben Stiller. He doesn't seem to really have a lot of range and his style isn't so amazing. What's the last great film he had? I loved "Dodgeball" and his cameos are always nice ("Happy Gilmore", for example) but he seems to play the same guy over and over (Gaylord Focker really isn't much different from the Ben Stiller in "There's Something About Mary").Also, this film relies almost entirely on potty humor. Some people will really be happy about the humor, whereas I prefer a more witty and sarcastic film. Cats flushing toilets, sexual elderly people, fake breasts. Not my sort of thing, really.The film was a good pace, so it was easily watchable even if it wasn't my style. And the addition of Dustin Hoffman to the cast was great. Robert DeNiro really runs the plot (I think he overshadows Stiller on many occasions), but Dustin Hoffman is the gem here. (In a recent review for "Stranger Than Fiction", I say much the same thing. But it's true -- Hoffman has a subtlety about him where he blends perfectly into his roles and seems more lifelike than the rest of the cast.) Barbara Streisand was also nice, which is odd because she's Barbra Streisand. The rest of the cast was unremarkable (though I must give credit to the casting director or whoever found the Jorge character... great job).If you're into Ben Stiller and/or "Meet The Parents", you'll get something out of this. If you're like me, you probably won't. I watched it because I was visiting my father, otherwise it would never have been on my screen. And I can safely say having seen it I wouldn't have been missing out.

MEET THE FOCKERS made me laugh a lot. It probably has more laughs than the original, but the laughs aren't as big or as fresh or as subtle. And as sequels go, it contains many scenes that are mere variations of the original: the dinner gone wrong, the sports competition gone wrong, the pet gone wrong, the Owen Wilson cameo, the "focker" puns, etc. But many of the variations are quite inspired. Thanks to the terrific cast. De Niro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand all look like they're having a great time. Each is given a scene or two to really shine; De Niro and Hoffman fare the best. A child actor's also been added to the cast, and he's a scene-stealer. I just wish Blythe Danner (Mrs. Byrnes) and Teri Polo (Pam Focker) were given more to do. But, as entertaining as I thought the movie was, expect many critics to be turned off or pretend to be turned off by the numerous toilet jokes. I say, flock 'em!

Believe the critics because this one is just a rehash of the first and I don't remember laughing even once during the entire film. Unfortunately, this sequel continues in the same vein as the original. Making fun of Greg's profession as a male nurse and using his last name in virtually every way possible to replace the sexual expletive, this film appears doomed from the start for family viewing.Along with heavy innuendo based on the family moniker, much of the script's humor relies on overt sexual themes for the punch lines. Working as a seniors' sex therapist, Roz promotes erotic exercise moves and candidly discusses options for an amorously repressed couple. A paternity case, a busload of buxom cheerleaders who start to remove their tops and an incident of mooning are also played for laughs. As well, a toddler learns to swear repeatedly and gets his hands on some hard liquor when a flustered caregiver is distracted by an incoming call. The results are supposed to be funny, but the farce often comes up short in good taste.

This movie in no way did the first justice. When the writers sat down I think the only thing discussed was how many times they could throw the word focker in the movie. Gregs last name was a humorous topic in Meet the Parents, but it really falls flat in the sequel. Every two minutes they try to spin off a joke about focker or gaylord and it seriously got old in the first two minutes of the sequel. As for the rest of the movie it was incredibly unbelievable. The reason Meet the Parents was so successful is because the audience can relate to Gregs situation meeting the parents and the unfortunate situations that come about. If you plan on seeing this movie I really hope you still go to stitches every time you here the word focker and do not mind a mediocre sequel with cheap laughs. The only time I laughed during this movie is when some guy fell down the steps and spilled his popcorn.And before I forget....If you cast a vote for this movie or any other please be realistic. Over 50% of the people who have casted a vote for this movie have given it a ten. How ignorant can you be. If you really think this movie is a classic I wonder how tough it was to grow up with an underdeveloped brain and would love to meet with you and discuss the brilliance that went into this movie. If you like the movie great, but don't skew the results so people actually think this is a classic. Save the 10 ratings for the Godfather, Shawshank redemption, braveheart, anything that didn't take a half an hour to write.

I enjoyed the sequel "Meet the Fockers" more than the original "Meet the Parents" for one reason: the performance of Dustin Hoffman. Overall, it was a fine ensemble cast and good scripting of the jokes and situations surrounding the irrepressible ex-CIA agent and family patriarch Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro). But Hoffman's character Bernie Focker, an attorney who retired to become a full-time dad to his son Greg (Ben Stiller), grounds this comedy in solid human values that raise the film beyond the level of nutty comedy.I admired how Hoffman's character revealed genuine pain following the nasty remarks of Jack Byrnes. For example, the shrine of framed memorabilia of his son's accomplishments was ridiculed by Jack. One could empathize with Bernie's pain which he registered at the criticism. Indeed throughout the film, the most memorable scenes were those with Hoffman's character on the defense, but also taking the offensive against Jack. The film also included some wildly funny moments, such as the teenager born out of wedlock to Greg's babysitter, a young lad with humongous eyebrows who was a dead-ringer for Ben Stiller's character and Jack's outrageous motor home rigged with listening devices, which provided him with his command center for spying on the Fockers. Much credit should go to director Jay Roach for outstanding comic rhythms, timing, and pacing.In the end, this was thoroughly enjoyable movie, which had the surprising effect of providing a good window into family values unusual for Hollywood film comedies.

Just as good the original, in my opinion. Any sequel-slack was ironed out with Dustin Hoffman's sidesplitting performance. I'm really surprised to see so many people find this an unworthy sequel... it's more of what made the original funny with just enough additions to keep it fresh.

After convincing his fiancée's parents to allow them to marry, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) now has to deal with what happens when her ex-CIA father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) meets his own wacky ex-hippy parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand.I really wanted to see this film when it was first announced. The original was very funny and it had a great repeat value. However, the reviews started coming in and they were all negative so I was a little discouraged. I still went to see it and it turned out to be very funny. The critics really need to lighten up since they turned away a fine comedy. Sure, some of the gags are old and tired but they still work. They use a lot of "Focker" jokes and of male nurse jokes sob that kind of got annoying but it wasn't an overload either. The story is pretty much the same as the first one except now Greg's parents are thrown into the mix and nothing ever goes right. The writers came up with a bunch of different, funny situations and some of them were recycled while others were new.The cast is great and they help move the film along nicely. The best was clearly Dustin Hoffman as Greg's dad. He was hilarious and fun to watch on screen. Ben Stiller was okay but his uptight character role is kind of getting annoying. Robert De Niro also gives a funny performance and he is now forgiven for appearing in Godsend. Barbara Streisand was surprisingly funny and bearable. I usually cannot stand her but she was alright in the movie. Blythe Danner gives a decent performance, nothing really special. Teri Polo was the only miscast in the movie. She just didn't fit or look well next to Hoffman, Stiller and De Niro. Owen Wilson makes a cameo and it was decent, a little unnecessary though.Jay Roach directs and he does a good job with the movie though it was a little too long. 115 minutes is kind of long for a comedy and because of the long running time, the film starts to bore around the end. They should have taken some things out to keep the film shorter and interesting. I also didn't like the character little Jack. He was the grandson of Jack (De Niro) and he was very annoying. The addition of the baby character was unnecessary and it kind of brought the film down. Compared to the original, the first one is funnier and more enjoyable. The second one is still pretty funny but it doesn't have a good repeat value. However, the film is still worth checking out in theaters. In the end, please ignore the critics and check this film out in theaters. Rating 7/10

There are many movies where the performances are so good that the weaknesses of the movie itself are almost oblivious.The casting in this film, bringing together the stars of the original with Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Greg aka Gaylord Focker's parents, is sensational.While I admit that I believed I would read comments and reviews about the crudeness of the material, I believe the reason this is not a typically tragic Hollywood farce is due to the strength of the performances and the interaction of the characters.As you know, the premise of the movie is very simple. Prior to the wedding of Greg and Pam, the two families will meet. In typical Hollywood sequel fashion, we already know that the Byrnses are somewhat reserved, set in their ways. So it is no surprise that the Fockers are almost the complete opposite.Hilarity ensures, some crude, some overtly sexual. But the cast is skillful and it plays more like a comic version of "Closer". You will believe that Bernie and Roz (amazing performances by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) are Greg Focker's parents. Not only is their interaction genuine, their love for their child is as well. Part of Greg's embarrassment is the knowledge of his parents' "quirks" and how different they are from the Byrnses. Ben Stiller aptly conveys this while not backing down from his love for his parents.Meanwhile, stern Jack Byrnes scans the Fockers for clues to prove why he should not like them, therefore not allowing his daughter to be married into that family. His design of the RV is classic Jack Byrnes. What is an improvement in this film, is that Jack discovers some things about himself and his relationship with his wife and daughter that change him. This may be the funniest performance in Robert DeNiro's career.Throughout the film, there are themes that everyone has experienced but most of all, how important love is. The love of another and the love of family and friends. There is a very good example of this in a scene between Teri Polo and Ben Stiller, after some new information is exposed that could possibly tear them apart once again.All in all, when you know the cast is having a good time, the audience does too. I will be seeing this one more than once.

I've been wanting to see Meet the Fockers ever since I heard it was coming out to theaters since I loved Meet the Parents. After hearing good reviews and how hilarious it was, I finally decided to rent it. To my viewing, I thought the movie was overrated. I had laughs in the film and I did like the characters besides the little kid, but I didn't have enough which I was hoping for. There were scenes that were stupid and just shouldn't be in the film. I mean I did have laughs and I loved the football and shot injections scenes but there wasn't enough hilarious parts to entertain me. Overall, a decent sequel with a few laughs but not enough to qualify to its prequel. This could be a letdown to Meet the Parents fans.Hedeen's Outlook: 6/10 ** C-

Despite the reviews being lukewarm, I went to see this movie on a recent afternoon because I had a couple of hours between holiday visits to friends. It was the only film that fit my schedule. It was not my first, second or third choice and if I had absolutely anything else to do and if the weather had been any more cooperative, I would have run - not walked out of the theater. I decided that since it remained at the top of the box office for another week, maybe, just maybe there was something redeeming about it. There isn't. Nothing. And the audience agreed. There were probably 20 of us and not one person - not one - laughed at any point in this movie. It is one of the most pathetic wastes of talent since - since - since I don't know what. Shame on everyone associated with this horribly unfunny movie.

"Meet the Fockers" sounds like "Meet the f-u-u-". Oops! Can't say that because of FCC guidelines. Just the same, the title pretty much describes the level of the humor in this Ben Stiller comedy. But that's redundant because it IS a Ben Stiller movie. Clearly my expectations for this movie were not high and, maybe because of that, I found "Meet the Fockers" quite funny.Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie for everyone. First off, the writers did not miss a single opportunity to play off of the name "Focker". It's silly and gets a little old but it somehow works with the other repetitious low-down gags.Focker is the family name for Greg (Focker), Ben Stiller. The funniest Fockers, however, (now I'm doing it) are Greg's parents Bernie and Roz, a loose and liberal Florida hippy couple still living in the last century and enjoying every minute of it. Dustin Hoffman, as Bernie displays a previously unrevealed talent for over the top comedy. Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie, is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker, reminiscent of the "zaftig" Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.Greg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiancée's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiancée Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby low-brow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren, two adorable twins playing Little Jack.So, go low, go loose -- or don't go at all -- but if you like Ben Stiller, go see "Meet the Fockers". Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long. Rated a B+.

All in all, not a bad film entertainment wise however I expected something smarter with more humor and execution then there was.Seems Deniro's character lost most of his appeal as well as the whole film turning more into a, "It's OK...they really liked these characters and situation so much, we don't have to work on it as hard and tons of people will still fill the box office" kinda film.Dustin Hoffman was the most talented of the players and I'm not particularly a fan of his and he entertained me more. Barbra... she should have pick a different film because she came off like a dusty IL' sports car with flat tires and cobwebs yet, no matter how dilapidated it looks, underneath you still believes there's a sports car in there somewhere but it is what ya see, if ya know what I'm talking about.We could have used Stiller stepping it up to keep things really interesting and pick up the slack yet they wrote him a bit toward the back and thats too bad.Just with all the talent and pull they had behind this to make it 'really' funny and entertaining, you'd think they would have. Yet a gun with no bullets is still just a hunk of metal. Naw, they weren't shooting blanks yet the powder was a bit too wet for me.Most of you will probably be happy saying your money was spent well, yet I believe those more hardcore watchers not wanting just a cookie cutter production will be disappointed a bit with the results.6.5 outta 10

Meeting the Parents of your girlfriend can be stressful enough. But having her parents meet yours can sometimes be a recipe for disaster, something Greg Focker finds to his peril; when both sets of parents meet on the eve of his wedding. Made after the success of Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers carries on where the last film left off, with Greg delivering babies while his stuffy future father in laws delivers ultimatums, both with memorable results. Of course Greg is now finally in "The Circle of Trust" a circle that is headed by Jack, Greg's uptight future father in law, retired from the CIA, yet still firmly attached to his former profession. Meanwhile Greg's own parents are laid back and free with their emotions, his mother being a sex therapist and his father a house husband. Knowing Jack's conservative ways Greg is delighted but terrified at his fiancés news that they are going to have a baby. Worried of Jacks reaction, things get worse when Greg's old teenage crush reappears, along with a 15 year old son who is a dead ringer for Greg and, as far as Jack's concerned, a prime contender for a DNA test . Meet the Fockers is based purely in the realm of a one joke movie (i.e. the family's name) and so has the longevity of one (i.e. very short) The main problems with the film is the heartbreaking (from a film fans point of view) sight of Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand all participating in a film that Benny Hill would have passed at. Streisand, the powerhouse all singing and acting legend, is here reduced to teaching senior citizens how to have better sex, something I could have lived without seeing. Hoffman is clearly having fun, although quite unaware that the audience isn't. His scenes with De Niro have a chemistry, but the scenes themselves do little to their reputations. One scene with Hoffman sitting on a toilet and De Niro in the shower waiting for him to "finish" really felt like an all time low, and when Hoffman flushed I hoped their careers wasn't going down with it. One high point is the appearance of Owen Wilson (Stiller's Hutch to his Starsky) who shows up at the end, but by that time I was too busy sawing through my wrists. Meet the Fockers has an incredible waste of exceptional talent, and that my friends is no laughing matter.

I just saw this movie yesterday and I was appalled at it. All of the humor in this movie is dirty, juvenile trash, with nothing the least bit clever or unique. The humor of this entire movie is every bit as shallow as the Focker/F***er pun that the title implies. It was particularly sad to see talented actors such as Robert Deniro and Dustin Hoffman try hopelessly to restart their now-pathetic careers with this sub-standard vehicle for Ben Stiller (who keeps repeating his "There's Something About Mary" role). The whole situation between Robert Deniro's character and the little baby nephew was just tedious and unfunny, and the fact that the movie tries to generate laughs by showing a baby picking up on foul language from others shows how low the writers went for humor. And Barbra Streisand is just outright annoying. Overall, this movie is just a jumble of desperate toilet humor, and sex jokes, and is a complete disgrace.

So in the first movie you had Ben Stillers character playing the main player. Or hero if you will. He was the one who had to go through all the trouble. A journey as some say. This time around, it's time for Robert De Niro's character has to go on a journey. His character has to evolve.And if you're fine with that idea, than you might enjoy the movie. Although the comic premise does promise many good things, not all are played out. But still it's funny enough. The new addition to the cast of the first movie fit in nicely. The Fockers (Dustin Hoffman and B. Streisand) are funny, although sometimes they do seem to overact a little bit. Of course they have to be the exact opposite of the Byrnes, because only then the humor works! It's fun, it's light, nothing more nothing less! :o)

I am of mixed minds when it comes to Barbra Streisand (see my long,involved screed about "The Mirror Has Two Faces"), but I will readily admit two things in her favor: the woman can sing the *ss off of a Broadway show tune, and the woman can play screwball comedy to perfection. That's why I like "Meet The Fockers" so much. Yes, the film is actually fairly sweet and sympathetic within its "comedic farce" settings. Yes, Robert DeNiro is compelling yet funny as an ex-CIA man who is wrapped a little too tight. Yes, there are plenty of gross-out jokes, and plenty of silly word plays and puns on the Focker family name. Yes, Dustin Hoffman is great in a very broadly played role (watching his character practice Capoeira is a hoot). But the real pleasure here is watching Streisand do what she does best on screen: real screwball comedy. Not romantic comedy ("Mirror Has Two Faces", which was for fans only), not romantic drama ("A Star Is Born"), not all those other genres she tackled because she wanted to be Taken Seriously...but simple, funny comedy in which she puts aside her need to be regarded as A Great Beauty (30 Years Younger Than Her Real Age) and simply plays a somewhat dippy, marvelously warm and funny older mother. She is every bit of Hoffman's and DeNiro's match, and she almost totally overwhelms poor Stiller and the other female leads. She's great. She's funny. She's adorable. She's doing what she does best. The movie is worth seeing just to see her (and Hoffman) in action. If you are any kind of fan of her early, funny movies ("What's Up Doc?", "Funny Girl"), you should check out "Meet The Fockers". You will find much to enjoy, along with a pretty fair family comedy.

"It's nice, all of us being here together, don't you think?"Ben Stiller followed up the hit 2000 comedy Meet the Parents with a slightly lukewarm revisit of Gaylord Focker, this time with his own parents in tow. It's not as funny as the first movie, but it's also not a complete blight on the quality of the first film.The plot this time around revolves around the meeting of Greg's and Pam's parents, as the soon to be in-laws have yet to be introduced. As you could probably guess, Jack (a returning Robert De Niro) clashes with the free-spirited and unorthodox Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbra Streisand). Conflict and the occasional humorous situation results.With such a great cast, It's a little disappointing that this feels like such a re-tread, and that so many of jokes are hit or miss. Greg once again finds himself straying outside of the circle of trust, there are more jokes about him being a nurse, a dog that likes to hump things, and a baby who curses. It's a bit of an understatement to say that Meet the Fockers starts off slowly. Still, there are some laughs to be had, and at the very least, watching this will get you caught up on events before the third (and much funnier looking) movie in the series rolls into theaters this winter. Fans of the first movie or Ben Stiller should check this out, but you should also keep your expectations at a moderate level. The fresh faces add some fun, but the writing is a little stale.

Gaylord Focker and Pam Byrnes are ready to be married, but first they think their parents ought to meet. Picking up where the first film left off, we now have another set of parents just as quirky as the first, giving us double the insanity. For fans of the first film, this should be a treat! For me, I'm getting my fill of Ben Stiller. He doesn't seem to really have a lot of range and his style isn't so amazing. What's the last great film he had? I loved "Dodgeball" and his cameos are always nice ("Happy Gilmore", for example) but he seems to play the same guy over and over (Gaylord Focker really isn't much different from the Ben Stiller in "There's Something About Mary").Also, this film relies almost entirely on potty humor. Some people will really be happy about the humor, whereas I prefer a more witty and sarcastic film. Cats flushing toilets, sexual elderly people, fake breasts. Not my sort of thing, really.The film was a good pace, so it was easily watchable even if it wasn't my style. And the addition of Dustin Hoffman to the cast was great. Robert DeNiro really runs the plot (I think he overshadows Stiller on many occasions), but Dustin Hoffman is the gem here. (In a recent review for "Stranger Than Fiction", I say much the same thing. But it's true -- Hoffman has a subtlety about him where he blends perfectly into his roles and seems more lifelike than the rest of the cast.) Barbara Streisand was also nice, which is odd because she's Barbra Streisand. The rest of the cast was unremarkable (though I must give credit to the casting director or whoever found the Jorge character... great job).If you're into Ben Stiller and/or "Meet The Parents", you'll get something out of this. If you're like me, you probably won't. I watched it because I was visiting my father, otherwise it would never have been on my screen. And I can safely say having seen it I wouldn't have been missing out.

MEET THE FOCKERS made me laugh a lot. It probably has more laughs than the original, but the laughs aren't as big or as fresh or as subtle. And as sequels go, it contains many scenes that are mere variations of the original: the dinner gone wrong, the sports competition gone wrong, the pet gone wrong, the Owen Wilson cameo, the "focker" puns, etc. But many of the variations are quite inspired. Thanks to the terrific cast. De Niro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand all look like they're having a great time. Each is given a scene or two to really shine; De Niro and Hoffman fare the best. A child actor's also been added to the cast, and he's a scene-stealer. I just wish Blythe Danner (Mrs. Byrnes) and Teri Polo (Pam Focker) were given more to do. But, as entertaining as I thought the movie was, expect many critics to be turned off or pretend to be turned off by the numerous toilet jokes. I say, flock 'em!

There's something very heartwarming and comforting about this movie. It's the type of movie you sit down with your family to watch. It's not outrageously funny, but there are a some funny moments. This brand of comedy doesn't often land well with me, but I watch these types of movies more for the feel-good nature of them. The acting is good and everyone seems to be having fun, which really translates well on screen. It feels like real dysfunctional families actually cohabitating on a vacation. Most of the magic of this film is in how real and believable the relationships are. There's just this feeling of warmth, comfort and family that makes this an enjoyable experience. But by no means would I say this movie is really breaking any barriers.

Believe the critics because this one is just a rehash of the first and I don't remember laughing even once during the entire film. Unfortunately, this sequel continues in the same vein as the original. Making fun of Greg's profession as a male nurse and using his last name in virtually every way possible to replace the sexual expletive, this film appears doomed from the start for family viewing.Along with heavy innuendo based on the family moniker, much of the script's humor relies on overt sexual themes for the punch lines. Working as a seniors' sex therapist, Roz promotes erotic exercise moves and candidly discusses options for an amorously repressed couple. A paternity case, a busload of buxom cheerleaders who start to remove their tops and an incident of mooning are also played for laughs. As well, a toddler learns to swear repeatedly and gets his hands on some hard liquor when a flustered caregiver is distracted by an incoming call. The results are supposed to be funny, but the farce often comes up short in good taste.

Series note: As this is a direct continuation of Meet the Parents (2000), it is recommended that you watch that film first. It gives necessary background exposition and characterization for this film.Gaylord "Greg" Focker (Ben Stiller) and fiancée Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) wedding is fast approaching, and their parents still have not met each other. So Greg and Pam fly from Chicago to New York to meet her parents, Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina (Blythe Danner), before heading off with them to Miami to meet his parents, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Mother Focker Roz (Barbara Streisand). The problem is that the Byrnes are staid, conservative (though slightly crazy) types who would never think of showing public affection, while the Fockers are still hippies--she is a sex therapist for elderly couples and he's a lawyer who became Mr. Mom once Gaylord was born. Can Gaylord keep his parents reined in enough to not cause Jack blow his lid and try to stop the wedding? Although I didn't think Meet the Fockers was quite as funny or successful as Meet the Parents, it's still funny and successful, with a bit less of an emphasis on nonstop outrageous humor and a bit more of an emphasis on the often amusing complexities of extended family relationships.If you've seen Meet the Parents first--and you should--some of the material, such as Gaylord's job, jokes based on the "Focker" name, and even Jack's background and disposition will have less of an impact, which initially partially depends on novelty and surprise. Additionally, director Jay Roach and the writing team of James Herzfeld, Marc Hyman and John Hamburg telegraph quite a few of the punch lines. For just one example, it's obvious that something is going to happen to Gaylord's rental car in New York as soon as we hear him opt out of purchasing insurance, blowing it off as a "scam" to make money.On the other hand, Roach and crew make it clear from the start that they're not exactly shooting for the same style of film as Meet the Parents. This is evident from the beginning, which cleverly pokes fun at Meet the Parents' "gradually going to hell in a handbasket" style by having everything go exactly right.Roach aims for classic scenarios of families colliding that have surprisingly serious subtexts (and in the real world, these kinds of situations do have an attendant humor, at least when we're not right in the midst of them). Every family tends to have its own customs and norms, its own take on ethics, etiquette, politics, religion and so on. Naturally, when we try to merge families through marriages, uncomfortable, often embarrassing, and frequently tense situations abound. Aside from the humor, this is the crux of Meet the Fockers.Another important subtext that occurs in various guises through the film (and for which the potential was there in Meet the Parents even if it wasn't capitalized on in quite the same way) is opening up to "free", honest expression of one's thoughts, feelings and desires versus showing a "proper" public face. This is particularly amusing and poignant in the case of Jack, whose job involved obtaining honest expression, but who is the strongest case of putting on a false public face--to an extent that he's bought into the persona himself. In a way, Roach and crew are suggesting that if we can really reach that ideal self-expression, maybe those family mergers, and even other kinds of cultural encounters (such as the Fockers' run-in with the police) could proceed more smoothly.So it's not so important whether Meet the Fockers is as funny as Meet the Parents. Roach isn't just trying to make you laugh, even though he does so frequently. Despite all the comments in others' reviews about sex-oriented humor (how could you not expect that in a film with a title like this?), or general "low-brow" humor, the comic situations here are more sophisticated in many ways than a typical "outrageous" comedy. That means that you're not going to laugh out loud, with tears streaming down your face, as often as you're going to be sitting there with a big smile on your face watching scenarios such as Bernie trying, and mostly succeeding, to hold on to his hippie ideals no matter what the short term costs. This is more a humor of slightly exaggerated but realistic folly, played fabulously by a stellar cast.

Folks in the U.S. are apparently more sentimental than we hardier Euro types, or at least that's what Hollywood believes. So meet the Fockers has the obligatory feelgood ending when each and every loose end is neatly tied up in the final ten minutes (or it could have been eleven) and for this viewer rather left a rather artificial sugary taste to what at times was a quite inspired film. I must admit that I haven't seen the prequel Meet The Parents so I cannot say whether or not this is better, worse, as good as or as bad as that film. What I can say is that when Meet The Fockers scores, which it does do every so often, it is invariably the achievement of the five main characters. In other hands a pretty ordinary script might otherwise have made a truly dreadful film. Hoffman and Streisand in particular gell nicely as the quirky, hippy parents who son Ben Stiller loves but who he worries about so much when tight-arsed Jack is around. One nice touch was Dina, Jack's wife, who is shown to be a woman in her own right though a long-suffering wife. Overall this is par for the course, a standard Tinseltown comedy and its moments and occasional good jokes are down to the cast. Don't expect a great deal and you won't be disappointed. You'll get what this was always intended to be, undemanding fodder with a few laughs.

This movie in no way did the first justice. When the writers sat down I think the only thing discussed was how many times they could throw the word focker in the movie. Gregs last name was a humorous topic in Meet the Parents, but it really falls flat in the sequel. Every two minutes they try to spin off a joke about focker or gaylord and it seriously got old in the first two minutes of the sequel. As for the rest of the movie it was incredibly unbelievable. The reason Meet the Parents was so successful is because the audience can relate to Gregs situation meeting the parents and the unfortunate situations that come about. If you plan on seeing this movie I really hope you still go to stitches every time you here the word focker and do not mind a mediocre sequel with cheap laughs. The only time I laughed during this movie is when some guy fell down the steps and spilled his popcorn.And before I forget....If you cast a vote for this movie or any other please be realistic. Over 50% of the people who have casted a vote for this movie have given it a ten. How ignorant can you be. If you really think this movie is a classic I wonder how tough it was to grow up with an underdeveloped brain and would love to meet with you and discuss the brilliance that went into this movie. If you like the movie great, but don't skew the results so people actually think this is a classic. Save the 10 ratings for the Godfather, Shawshank redemption, braveheart, anything that didn't take a half an hour to write.
