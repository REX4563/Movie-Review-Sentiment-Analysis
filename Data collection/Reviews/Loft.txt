I had to watch this film with subtitles as I'm not fluent in Dutch. I haven't seen the original version but after seeing this I intend to watch it to see how it compares.I spent the entire film trying to guess who dunnit with my mind changing at every turn but never able to see the twist at the end. Yet on top of that twist there was another! I couldn't believe how well written it was. There were certain scenes that were filmed beautifully, there's a flashback scene of Mat where the camera does a 360 degree turn around him. You have to see it to truly appreciate it.Overall it's definitely worth a watch, subtitles or no subtitles, a good film makes it easy to forget them. The characters are easy to pick up, yet complex enough to keep a good narrative going. You'll cringe, you'll laugh and you'll be hanging on the edge of your seat to find out who the murderer is.

I keep wondering if it is every man's dream to have a wife and then mistress(es). If they do, don't they keep it as a secret, even to their friends? Why would they share an apartment for their mistresses and conquests? Logistically it seems very difficult to implement. Anyways, it is this intriguing thought that attracts me into this movie: we have five handsome and successful men and their wives, plus two mistresses and another young woman who is the sister of one of the five men. Then the police. There are simply too many characters to cram into a 108-minute drama, not to mention the different twists in plots. It is no doubt an interesting suspense story, but the sheer number of characters seems to weaken the character development of the five friends, let alone their relationships with their wives and the friendship among them. There were many other elements the playwright could have explored instead of focusing on the twist of the actual murder. Sometimes I even think the interrogation scenes could have been cut. A typical suspense movie, it does make us keep suspecting everyone to be the murderer, including the other mistress. Really miss Hitchcock! Ironically both the mistresses look more attractive than the five wives! I wonder if the director did it on purposeI would love to see the original Loft made in Belgium (in Dutch) in 2008 and look forward to the Hollywood remake (in English) to be released in 2013.

I saw this movie on the film 1 channel for free. I'm not a fan of dutch movies and I would never spend money to see those movies. why? Because in all the Dutch movies I've seen the acting is really bad. Loft is no exception. Barry Atsma is alright and the two Marrocan looking actors were also pretty good. But seeing Jeroen van Koningsbrugge being interrogated by the police was cringe-worthy. This movie also tries to copy stuff from Hollywood movies. the actors talk in a way Dutch people don't normally do. (calling people by their family name for example)Somehow you will watch this movie and not really care about the characters because you'll keep looking at them as actors and not "real" people. The storyline of the movie isn't bad and despite the bad acting I kept watching. If you do like this movie I recommend watching "Very Bad Things" from 1998. The story is somewhat similar but funny.

Loft is one of the best dutch movies I have ever seen. The movie is very exciting. During the movie you're asking yourself "who did it?" and till the end it is not certain who the killer is. Humour is not funny, typical dutch humor. There is this so called funny guy Willem who tells jokes and they are not funny at all. I know dutch people, I live among them, and I know my dutch friends would have laughed about these stupid jokes. The jokes are lame, low. Making fun of other people. Not funny! (Or did I mention that already?) Acting is not very good, but I forgive this because the story is very good. There is this guy who falls in love with a hooker. She gets angry because she thinks he brings other girls to the loft. And what if he would? She's the hooker, so what? Very hypocritical. At the end, he meets this hooker and she asks him if he wants to drink a cup of coffee with him. What a stupid ending! The movie should have ended a scene before the last scene.I;m not comparing this movie to The matrix, but imagine Neo would have saved the earth and Trinity would have been alive as well, Neo would say to Trinity; "Would you like to drink a cup of coffee with me?" It does not make any sense. It's the opposite of a cherry on your ice cream. It's like leaving the church before singing.But I must be honest, this movie is worth watching. Except the ending, skip that, somehow.

5 adulterous men share a loft to do whatever they please at any given time without their significant others catching on. Its fun at first but somewhere along the way complications arise. Loft has quite a lot going for it. It has suspense, drama and enough twists and turns to keep it's viewers watching. Time lapses are nicely done and add to the suspense of the film. The acting is convincing enough to make you either dislike or sympathize with the characters. Set within the world of high earning architects, Loft is stylishly shot and very well photographed. As you keep watching you get to see just how deceitful and nasty some of the characters can get, and with a mixture of whores, manhood and lies, you probably don't want to miss out on this little gem of a film.
