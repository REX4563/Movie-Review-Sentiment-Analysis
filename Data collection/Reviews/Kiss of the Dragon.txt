Liu Jian (aka "Johnny") is a top level cop from Bejing on temporary assignment in Paris to aid French police in a sting operation to take down a Chinese heroine kingpin. But things go bad and a double-cross ensues, leaving Liu Jian framed for murder and running for his life. One is thing certain, though, our hero won't be taken without a fight... a really good fight... and a few more after that. Luc Besson's screenplay isn't exactly creative, but given the genre, it's pretty darn good. I know I sure sighed with relief that Liu Jian (played with subtle excellence by Jet Li) wasn't driven by some emotionally haunting past, like the death of a wife and child, as is so typical in super-cop action films. In fact, we get just the opposite--a man who simply loves his job and does it very well, but is still human enough to make mistakes, feel pain and make realistic choices (well, mostly).The story isn't without its flaws, however. Mindless thugs do play their part and there is an utterance of the most over-used villain line of all time: "Bring him to me alive; I'll deal with him myself" (or something to that affect). But somehow, it doesn't sound quite so corny coming from actor Tcheky Karyo (as Inspector Jean-Pierre Richard), who manages to play the heartless villain with a great deal of intelligence. Rounding out the cast is Bridget Fonda's Jessica, the prostitute with a good heart and, yes, a young daughter in jeopardy. But despite its few formulaic shortcomings, Kiss of the Dragon still delivers.What really stands out in this film is the way the fight sequences flow with the rest of the story, unlike so many other movies that seem to be constructed around a few preconceived action scenes. It's a martial arts action film done right. Thanks to the superb direction of Chris Nahon, Kiss of the Dragon is classy, well paced and gives us a near perfect blend of drama and levity (no ridiculous one-liners here, but definitely some laughs along the way). Best of all, Nahon engages the audience and makes the story work to a reasonable level of believability.

It is an action-filled and violent film , being utterly filmed in Paris . Li shows awesome skills , as he hits , punches and kicks most of Paris hoodlums into tiny pieces . The battle scenes are sliced up by means of flashy quick cuts that sometimes reduce Jet Li's extraordinary athleticism to a little more than the backdrop to a video clip . An exciting art martial movie in which , once again , an oriental Chinesse super cop is sent loan to tackle crime in the West . The style of action in this movie was heavily influenced by comments made during series of messages posted by fans on the Jet Li website forum , immediately after the release of Romeo must die (2000) in the United States , the fans wanted more realistic fighting as in Jet Li's movie Jet Li's Fist of Legend (1994) . The rousing fights include deadly use of fists , feet and palms ; being perfectly staged by expert Corey Yeun . Fights , attacks and exciting combats very well staged by great fighters , in fact , here are only seven wires used in the entire movie, the only scenes involving wire work were when Jet Li had to jump up to kick the pool ball and when Cyril Raffaelli performs his one-and-a-quarter backwards somersault-kick ; the result is a strong entry for art martial buffs . Actors made their owns stunts ; some of the players got injured and to had to be hospitalized during the shooting , some of them suffered mild concussions during filming, after being struck several times during fighting scenes . The only scenes that used CGI are when Jet Li falls down the laundry drop with CG flames surrounding him and in the hotel scene when Jet Li kicks the ball from the pool table . Amid the glamour and grandeur of the scenarios , including luxury hotel , is developed an intrigue about women exploitation and dealing with a Chinese agent who attempts to restore his name . Colorful and luxurious cinematography by Thierry Arbogast . Adequate musical score fitting to action by Craig Armstrong . This moving film was lavishly co-produced and written by the great producer/director Luc Besson and well realized by Chris Nahon . Director Chris Nahon had to slow down the fight scene between Jet Li and Cyril Raffaelli because they were moving too fast for the camera. Filmmaker Nahon establishes his signature style of kinetically-paced story-telling through sumptuous imagery , leading to international critical acclaim . Chris Nahon was born in France , he is a good director and writer, known for Empire of the wolves (2005) , Blood: the last vampire (2009) and Kiss of the dragon (2001) . Rating : Better than average art martial movie . Worthwhile watching .

This is definitely Jet Li's best action movie since he came over from Hong Kong. Some scenes reminiscent of Fist of Legend in this one. Quite well choreographed fight scenes with good realistic violence a la Bruce Lee. The plot is rather formulaic, as is much of the dialogue (I expected better from Besson), but the movie has a bit of the 'Nikita' flair (guys going crazy with fully automatic weapons in public places). A bit too much talking and not enough fighting, but far superior to 'Romeo Must Die'. The use of no wires is also a very nice touch. Best action movie of this summer so far. (8/10)

The action scenes in "Kiss of the Dragon" are outstanding. The skill of the players, and their direction is nonpareil. One doesn't see any of the little scenes where two or three fighters are jumping up and down waiting for their cues. Pay attention to the fight scene in the police training room. I think its the best I've seen. A trademark of Jet Li films seems to be a display of the highest quality martial arts. His skills, and those of his antagonists, provide detailed and polished confrontations that are simply thrilling. And I love those needles!The pace of the film is excellent too. The action just keeps coming.  There is just enough talking and character interaction to keep the plot alive and well. Bridget Fonda manages well in a role I think was not really designed for her. She is one of those actors who always finds her character and makes it work. The film is violent, to be sure. And the bad guys are the worst. Their blatant, public methods are almost too much to believe. Still, the pace of the action leaves one little time to ponder details. One element I wish the director had left out is Jet Li dodging about a thousand rounds of full auto gunfire. Everyone seems compelled to shoot such scenes, but two guns raking rounds across the hotel lobby could not possibly miss. It is virtually enfilade fire, and no one could get through that. Otherwise, the firearms action was believable and thrilling to watch. Even the music, though not my style, seems to work well with the action. The director puts it all together in a wild ride I can recommend to any action film fan.

What do you want from a Jet Li movie? By the time of Kiss Of The Dragon being released, many of his fans had been vociferous about how his film's were losing realism in the fight scenes. Here, teaming up with Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen in the writing room, Li himself set about readdressing the balance for American produced martial artistry. The result is of course a preposterous plot that should duly have been expected, but without doubt for action fans this is a real high kicker that delivers thrill after thrill as Li beats up Paris.The plot simply sees Li as Chinese intelligence agent Liu Siu-jian who is sent to Paris to aid in the apprehension of a Chinese drug lord. Things go belly up when corrupt cops led by Insp. Richard {Tchéky Karyo} wipe out the target and frame Liu Siu-jian for the murder. But he ain't going to take it on the chin. So with the help of prostitute witness Jessica Kamen (Bridget Fonda), he sets about clearing his name whilst perhaps helping Jessica get her life back on track too. Cue the odd couple forming a tender relationship as they shift from one death defying encounter to another.The action on offer here is excellently put together, there's minimal CGI and even less wire work involved. This is stunts and martial artistry produced by a master craftsman. From a unique use of a snooker ball to an exhilarating smack down with a class of martial arts students, and on to a tag team scrap with the blonde twins, this has enough biff and bam to fill the Louvre itself. Li is on fire, not only one of the toughest guys on the planet, but also one of the coolest. While Fonda is hugely touching in a stereotypical role and Karyo continues to be one of the best psycho actors in the new millennium.Flaws and plot holes here? Of course. Does it matter in a buttock kicking action movie? Course not. 7.5/10

KISS OF THE DRAGON / (2001) *** (out of four) By Blake French:	I admire "Kiss of the Dragon" because it's a wake-up call to the increasingly desperate genre of martial arts action movies. After disasters like "Romeo Must Die" and any recent Jackie Chan production, my expectations for "Kiss of the Dragon" were not exactly sky high. It seems as if every movie like this replaces a story and characters with silly special effects and high-tech action sequences involving martial arts fighting. Here, there are solid, visible characters and an involving story. That's a real accomplishment these days.	Jet Li starred in 25 successful Asian films before making his debut in America as the villain in the lackluster "Lethal Weapon 4." His last film, "Romeo Must Die," was a pitiful action extravaganza that borrowed elements from Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet." Before this film, I could not stand this martial artist turned actor. Here, he makes a strong name for himself. He co-produces the film, stars in it, and created the original story. According the production notes, Li initially envisioned a dramatic film that combined his trademark martial arts and action heroics with strong, recognizable characters.  	"I wasn't interested in making a movie about a big action hero who saves the day," explains Li. "My character, Liu Jiuan, is one of China's best agents, with tremendous abilities in martial arts and acupuncture. He's determined and driven. But he's not a superman; he's human. When his mission goes wrong, Liu initially doesn't know how to handle things."
	Liu Jiuan is the most skilled law enforcer in China brought to Paris on a top secret mission where he must assist an unorthodox police official named Richard (Tcheky Karyo) in dealings involving some off the record drug traffic. His mission goes awry and he quickly learns that Richard, who seemingly has a limitless supply of henchmen, is the villainous mastermind behind most of the crime in France. Liu becomes trapped in a dangerous conspiracy-Richard frames him for a murder he tried to stop. Liu also becomes involved with a local American woman named Jessica (Bridget Fonda), who was forced into prostitution when Richard kidnapped her child. The story feels real, instead of a clothesline for countless gratuitous action sequences. There are plenty of action sequences, however, and the fighting does not involve wires, phony stunts, or computer generated effects like in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," and "The Matrix." The fights are grounded and real. "We went back to the basics," explains Jet Li, "keeping the fighting simple and based more in reality." Liu's principle fighting weapons are not guns or swords, but acupuncture needles, which play an important role in the mysterious "kiss of the dragon" revealed at the movie's climax. "Kiss of the Dragon" is directed by French commercial director Chris Nohan in his feature film debut. He does a good job of involving the audience in the action, and distracting us from some of the film's weaknesses. But no director could conceal some of the bad writing, terrible dialogue, unanswered questions, plausible motives, and stereotypical character traits. "Kiss of the Dragon" is not a great movie, but for Jet Li, this is good stuff nonetheless.

Kiss of the Dragon is a hyperactive martial arts movie with a heavy European feel. After Jet Li's fans were left disappointed with the fake, CGI-enhanced fighting in Romeo Must Die he decided to go back to practical, hand-to-hand combat with literally no strings attached. KOTD is the perfect excuse for action, with minimal plot and impossible odds.Basically, Jet Li plays a Chinese cop Lui Jian who travels to Paris to help the police bring a crime boss to justice. But the French police just happen to be heavily, heavily corrupt and kill Mr. Big, framing Lui Jian in the process. Keen to stay alive, Lui Jian flees the scene, but not before screaming, mad and completely hat stand police inspector Richard (Tcheky Caryo in his typically delirious role) sends just about every hardened police psycho after him. Outrageously outnumbered, Lui Jian prevails and fights his way through swarms and swarms of thugs out for his blood. Using only his hands and feet (and any useful nearby tool) he manages to wipe them all out.Far-fetched it may be, but action choreographer Cory Yuen shoots it all in the most realistic and stylish way. You really will believe Lui Jian is capable of such an impossible feat, that's how realistic the action is. And all without glamorising guns.KOTD uses the rule of increasingly mad set-pieces. The first desperate escape through the corridors and passageways of the hotel, the death-defying escape from the Seine Barge and through the tunnels and sewers, the orphanage confrontation and (especially) the final scene in the police station where Lui Jian takes on a dojo full of martial artist police officers, evil twins and finally Inspector Richard. It's all breathtaking stuff and very, very violent. With far too many sanitised PG-13 minded 'action' movies abundant these days KOTD is a breath of hardcore fresh air.If you like this then I suggest checking out The Transporter. It may be slightly tamer but it's made by the same people (producer Luc Besson, Writer Robert Mark Kamen and Cory Yuen) and is also set in France, only with a warmer, more exotic look.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a great Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. There are some extras and a commentary if you're into that sort of thing.

Jet Li produced this movie together with Luc Besson. Director/Producer Luc Besson is known for his love for violence. Fortunately that violence is often portrayed in a cartoon like fashion, which makes the violent scenes bearable and even funny. However this time the violence sometimes is just too gross, unfit for a movie like this. Not suited for those beneath 16 years of age. The story of a violent chief of police isnt credible either in the violent way it is portrayed here. So it doenst serve any purpose besides shock value. That is my only criticism of this kung fu fight movie, besides some other flaws in the story that just arent believable either. It could have been much better, with less gross violence and a bit more credibility in the story. Now it barely rises above a good B movie.Still I really enjoyed it. And don't get me wrong, the kung fu fighting scenes are excellent! It is just a few other violent scenes that are distasteful. But enough said about the violence, let's talk about the wonderful performance of the lovely Bridget Fonda, in her second to last role of her carreer. She is to die for in her role as a prostitute who comes to the aid of a chinese cop played by Jet Li. Together they have to bring down a corrupt chief of police who runs a prostitute organisation. Not that the story matters much, it is just a contineous fighting barrage intertwined with exciting chases. Although there are lots of pauses, which gives the characters of Jet Li and Bridget Fonda time to interact with eachother.
Their acting really makes this movie rise far above the average kung fu movie. Summarizing: the story has some flaws which make the sum total fall flat a bit. Still very enjoyable. I will wanna see it again. 7 stars. Could have been 8 stars though with a more credible story...

I was hoping this movie to be better than 'Romeo Must Die' and I was not disappointed. I truly believe this is Jet Li's English coming out movie (too bad it was released in the summer when other bigger movies come out).I did not go to see the movie for the story line and those who don't won't be disappointed either. The action was great especially the final scenes. Bridget Fonda did not do much (found her irritating in some scenes) but then again, did not watch the movie because she was there.Believable, maybe not ... Jet Li as the new Bruce Lee, most definitely!8/10

Kiss of the Dragon' might be just another action/martial arts' movie that is sitting on the shelf of your local video store. However once you start to watch it, you will realise that like some of its characters, it is a movie that is very deceptive and will leave you breathless. With the screenplay based on the story written by star Jet Li himself, this film has moments that no-one could ever comprehend seeing. While Li might be criticised for being one dimensional' in his movie roles, it has to be said that he is one of the best martial arts actors going around at the present time.Liu, a Chinese intelligence officer, goes to Paris on assignment and becomes embroiled in a deadly conspiracy. When the man he has come to help betrays him, he is forced on the run, accused of a murder he didn't commit. He teams up with Jessica, an American woman forced into prostitution against her will, who wants to escape and seek justice. As Jessica and Liu go up against cunning and ruthless adversaries, Liu makes a promise to Jessica that could compromise his career, even his life.The star of this film is Liu (Jet Li), who is an expert Chinese cop sent to stop an international drug conspiracy. He is traveling to the city of Paris for the first time, making it totally alien to him. Liu carries only a gun and needles which are rapt around his wrist. These are acupuncture needles, which he has the skill to use, to help heal his friends or kill his enemies. The finale action sequence has Liu refer to the title of the film, whereby the use of a needle technique called Kiss of the Dragon', which is highly illegal, as it must be, which can disrupt the body's blood flow, making all the blood travel to the head and then killing the person as it tries to escape from whatever cavity it can. This scene was astonishing to see being played out.The supporting cast in Kiss of the dragon' consists of Jessica (beauty Bridget Fonda), a girl who is forced to take drugs and be a prostitute by French Police inspector Richard (Tcheky Karyo). You do not refuse Richard, as the consequences could be fatal. He has many henchmen that are on the lookout for John' (Liu), as he has the evidence that could destroy Richard. Along the way Jessica meets up with Liu and they help each other out of sticky situations that have arisen. I enjoy the role taken on by Fonda a lot, as her character gives the story its emotion and balance whereby she helps Liu get around Paris.  I like how and where this movie was presented. The director shows off Paris in many ways, such as landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, which is cleverly incorporated through a fighting sequence. The director Chris Nahon was able to do this, via producer and screenwriter Luc Besson's help in getting leading cinematographer Thierry Arbogast, who did some great work. While the story might be simple on the surface, who can complain when there is such great action scenes to compensate.This then leads me into Kiss of the dragon's' action and stunts which are exhilarating. Li's character has many fighting sequences that you would believe he has no hope of winning. The start of the film makes uncertain of what is going to happen, then in the blink of an eye you are presented with action and stunts that will leave you speechless. The one scene at the start which shows Liu slamming a billiard ball to kill a villain was unbelievable. Then the fighting scenes at the shop, boat, office building and orphanage are full-on, making them intoxicating to the viewers. However one of the final fighting scenes with Liu taking on a whole class of Black belts is hilarious, as you know he is going to win. Kiss of the Dragon' works, because where the story is lacking, the action and fighting scenes take up the slack. Jet Li has done some good movies, such as `Lethal Weapon 4' and Romeo Must Die' where he shows off all his martial art skills. If you have not seen him in either of those films, then watch them by all means. Finally, I want to mention that I have had many treatments of acupuncture in 2002 which have helped me immensely. However, when I have my next treatment of those little needles' I might squirm a bit, being quick to remember what Liu could do with an acupuncture needle.
CMRS gives Kiss of the Dragon': 4 (Very Good Film)

This is as good as a violent action movie can get. I am not a fan of martial art movies, and would probably have avoided it, if it was not produced by Luc Besson (director of the original 'Nikita' and of the '5th Element') and acted among other by the excellent Bridget Fonda and Tcheky Karyo. I was not disappointed by their acting, by the way, and even the martial arts star was not bad at all. The story of the Chinese cop framed by his French counterparts in a murder and drugs intrigue has not too much logic, but what logic can you expect from such a movie - when a full hotel and a tourist boat are destroyed in matter of minutes, and dozens of bodies head gladly to the Garden of Eden for the 'pleasure' of the viewer. Pleasure it is indeed if you can put common sense aside, watch and enjoy the choreography of the fights, the various and creative ways people seem to die, and the well filmed Paris landscape, now theater for the real life (should I say real death?) Far Eastern martial arts wars. Interestingly enough, the French play the role of the bad guys in the movie, while the Chinese are the good ones - this must be some kind of concession to penetrate the big Far East market. The film gets 7/10 on my scale, the best I can grade this type of cinematographic entertainment.

Liu Jian (Jet Li) is a Chinese policeman sent to France to help with the apprehension of big-time Chinese drug lord. But Jian is quickly double-crossed and finds himself on the run having been accused of murder. The one person who may be able to help him is a drug-addicted prostitute whose child is being held hostage by the same man who set-up Jian - and he's a high-ranking French policeman. Jian and the prostitute make for an unlikely pair, but they'll have to work together to make things right.As an action movie, Kiss of the Dragon gets several things right. Both Jet Li and Bridget Fonda are more than capable of pulling off this kind of movie. Li, in particular, is exceptionally good showing the moves that have made him an internationally acclaimed martial arts star. He does a lot of different moves in the movie but my particular favorite is a quick one involving a pool ball that he sends flying with a well placed foot. Unfortunately, beyond the two stars and a wickedly evil performance by Tchéky Karyo, the rest of the movie is pretty average. It's one action/martial arts cliché after then next with the child being held hostage the icing on the cake. The only action standard the movie fails to include is letting the male and female leads fall in love with each other. And I'm glad because that would have really ruined the movie. As it is, Kiss of the Dragon is a harmless enough time waster that may lack creativity, but benefits from the presence of Jet Li.

Perhaps we have come back to where we started as Jet Li takes up the mantle of the great Oriental martial arts heroes.Li is excellent in his role as the police officer who has come to France to assist the Police in Paris with a conspiracy.  Things turn sour for him, and, along with the excellent Fonda [who gets better by the film] he has to take control and investigate for himself or lose his own life.Well directed and with some brilliantly choreographed action scenes, this is definitely one to see.

Martial Arts Movie for Action Fans with Jet Li in Hyperdrive and the Carnage Never Stops. This is Comic-Book Stuff with Our (Super) Hero Displaying Powers Absent in Mortal Men. It is All Ramped Up, Over the Top, Very Violent, and the Movie Takes No Prisoners.Luc Besson from Behind the Scenes Delivers, Along with His Superstar Jet Li, an Action Movie that Pulls No Punches and is a Ride-Along of Ridiculous Fight Scenes that are Always a Hoot for Fans of this Type of Stuff. There is Plenty of Bang for the Buck.The French Detective can go a Few Beats too Far Pushing His Subordinates Around and Bridget Fonda as the Human Anchor Whore with a Heart of Gold and a Cute as a Button Daughter in Tow, May be at Least One Beat too Good to be True, but there had to be Something to Pause the Mayhem. She Does, but Only a Brief Pause and We're Back to Kicking Ass.Overall, with Very Little Wire Work, Jet Li Fans can File Back in Lock Step, and Action Movie Adrenaline Types will have Very Little to Gripe About. It is Nonsensical, Bone Crushing, Bloodletting with its Heart Buried Beneath the Brutality, but it is Pumping the Pathos Enough to Allow Some Humanity to Contrast the Otherwise Inhuman Villains.No Compromises Here, this is One that Delivers what it is Selling in an Ultra-Stylistic Ballet of Blood, Bone Snapping, and Bullets and it is One of Jet Li's Best.

Jet Li is the Man. Without Jet Li, Chris Nahon' "Kiss of the Dragon" would be a forgettable action exercise. To his credit director, Chris Nahon, brings to the screen the most realistic, controlled, brutal, and unforgiving martial arts fight sequences to date-- "Enter the Dragon" quality. And the Bruce Lee comparison to Li does apply. There is no wasted motion here. All the fight sequences, particularly one set in the martial arts dojo, are concise, expedient, and without mercy. It's what martial arts is intended to be given that the best choice is not to fight at all, if not then it is to end the fight quickly and definitively. Jet Li executes with speed, power, and precision. He is world class. He is not pulling his blows much-- if any. Li has a powerful screen presence. What works for him is the understated persona, and someone you just don't f--- with. When his character, "Johnny" says "Don't do that again...", only a fool wouldn't listen. Good for the movie, there are a lot of stupid people in it The story by Li, along with Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, starts off simple, then more or less becomes background. Li plays a Beijing cop Liu Jian, on assignment in Paris to investigate a Chinese businessman. Jian (or Johnny) is framed for the murder of the businessman by the French cop heading the investigation, Richard (Tcheky Karyo). Through a chance encounter, Johnny befriends the hooker who witnessed the murder- this is Jessica played sympathetically and effectively by Bridget Fonda. Fonda looks great here-- even playing a hooker. Turns out that Jessica is a heroin junkie strung out on Investigator Richard's payroll, who is also holding her daughter. Johnny must clear his name and gives Jessica his word that he will save her daughter. This is just great hero stuff... There is an quiet moment in the movie where Jessica says to Johnny, "I trusted you..."--i.e. 'you disappointed me.' Being a man of honor, he will honor his word like life or death. This maybe Jet Li's breakthrough movie. His Johnny is a quiet man of his word, and someone who is willing to die for it. He is a classic hero here. Bridget Fonda gives depth to a thinly written character-- she plays it with heart and smarts. All around this a good summer movie. Be in awe of the prowess and talents of Jet Li, and don't think about the story too much... Really...

This is one of the dumbest movies I have seen. What little plot there is relies mainly on the fight scenes to tie the movie together. Basically, the movie jumps from one fight scene to the next, each one more unbelievable. It gets to be a bit tiresome watching one guy fighting a roomful of adversaries while each bad guy politely waits untilits his turn to get knocked around. Shades of Chuck Norris! The story is written in the typically heavy-handed far eastern style which makes all westerners into either bad guys or ignorant bumpkins. After watching for a while, I actually got bored with the whole thing.One more point about this movie (and this applies to others as well): People who know nothing about guns should not be allowed to make movies that depict guns and actors who don't know how to use a gun properly should not be allowed to act in them.

Lets face it any one who watches a movie featuring Luc besson and/or Jet Li watches it for constant thrill a minute action with a little bit of humour and some emotional moments (courtesy luc besson). No fan of either expects an epical action movie spanning over three hours and thousands of extras.Keeping this in mind this movie is copy perfect movie from both the stars, lots of kung fu action, the usual drama involving the missfit of society with the slightest hint of love, this movie is signature work from both.The rest of the cast plays their part Bridget Fonda looks lovely and carries of the role as "ex-junkie hooker, with a child" with an innocence that is quite endearing.Tchéky Karyo who has proved himself as a brilliant actor maintains his high standards. The character artists are also again quite perfect which reminds me:-although its hard to logically so many people doing Kung Fu in France Luc Besson has a brilliant scene in the film that justifies so many of the people knowing kung fu and also why the twin hit men did. This particular scene was also quite a lovable scene and another signaturish scene in the movie.The Only Things thats going against the movie is the lack of a REALLY big action scene (something that we come to expect from luc) and the fact that Jet Li has not yet come around to playing his age (come on man if you look the age then play it, there is no reason you cannot be a action star who looks 35-40 p.s there is no hint of him acting young in this movie but its something occurred to me).All in all a movie thats gives you exactly what you expect, short and sweet, a must watch for fans of luc and jet.

Liu Jian (aka "Johnny") is a top level cop from Bejing on temporary assignment in Paris to aid French police in a sting operation to take down a Chinese heroine kingpin. But things go bad and a double-cross ensues, leaving Liu Jian framed for murder and running for his life. One is thing certain, though, our hero won't be taken without a fight... a really good fight... and a few more after that. Luc Besson's screenplay isn't exactly creative, but given the genre, it's pretty darn good. I know I sure sighed with relief that Liu Jian (played with subtle excellence by Jet Li) wasn't driven by some emotionally haunting past, like the death of a wife and child, as is so typical in super-cop action films. In fact, we get just the opposite--a man who simply loves his job and does it very well, but is still human enough to make mistakes, feel pain and make realistic choices (well, mostly).The story isn't without its flaws, however. Mindless thugs do play their part and there is an utterance of the most over-used villain line of all time: "Bring him to me alive; I'll deal with him myself" (or something to that affect). But somehow, it doesn't sound quite so corny coming from actor Tcheky Karyo (as Inspector Jean-Pierre Richard), who manages to play the heartless villain with a great deal of intelligence. Rounding out the cast is Bridget Fonda's Jessica, the prostitute with a good heart and, yes, a young daughter in jeopardy. But despite its few formulaic shortcomings, Kiss of the Dragon still delivers.What really stands out in this film is the way the fight sequences flow with the rest of the story, unlike so many other movies that seem to be constructed around a few preconceived action scenes. It's a martial arts action film done right. Thanks to the superb direction of Chris Nahon, Kiss of the Dragon is classy, well paced and gives us a near perfect blend of drama and levity (no ridiculous one-liners here, but definitely some laughs along the way). Best of all, Nahon engages the audience and makes the story work to a reasonable level of believability.

Fights , attacks and exciting combats very well staged by great fighters , in fact , here are only seven wires used in the entire movie, the only scenes involving wire work were when Jet Li had to jump up to kick the pool ball and when Cyril Raffaelli performs his one-and-a-quarter backwards somersault-kick ; the result is a strong entry for art martial buffs . Actors made their owns stunts ; some of the players got injured and to had to be hospitalized during the shooting , some of them suffered mild concussions during filming, after being struck several times during fighting scenes . The only scenes that used CGI are when Jet Li falls down the laundry drop with CG flames surrounding him and in the hotel scene when Jet Li kicks the ball from the pool table . Amid the glamour and grandeur of the scenarios , including luxury hotel , is developed an intrigue about women exploitation and dealing with a Chinese agent who attempts to restore his name . Colorful and luxurious cinematography by Thierry Arbogast . Adequate musical score fitting to action by Craig Armstrong . This moving film was lavishly co-produced and written by the great producer/director Luc Besson and well realized by Chris Nahon . Director Chris Nahon had to slow down the fight scene between Jet Li and Cyril Raffaelli because they were moving too fast for the camera. Filmmaker Nahon establishes his signature style of kinetically-paced story-telling through sumptuous imagery , leading to international critical acclaim . Chris Nahon was born in France , he is a good director and writer, known for Empire of the wolves (2005) , Blood: the last vampire (2009) and Kiss of the dragon (2001) . Rating : Better than average art martial movie . Worthwhile watching .

This is definitely Jet Li's best action movie since he came over from Hong Kong. Some scenes reminiscent of Fist of Legend in this one. Quite well choreographed fight scenes with good realistic violence a la Bruce Lee. The plot is rather formulaic, as is much of the dialogue (I expected better from Besson), but the movie has a bit of the 'Nikita' flair (guys going crazy with fully automatic weapons in public places). A bit too much talking and not enough fighting, but far superior to 'Romeo Must Die'. The use of no wires is also a very nice touch. Best action movie of this summer so far. (8/10)

The action scenes in "Kiss of the Dragon" are outstanding. The skill of the players, and their direction is nonpareil. One doesn't see any of the little scenes where two or three fighters are jumping up and down waiting for their cues. Pay attention to the fight scene in the police training room. I think its the best I've seen. A trademark of Jet Li films seems to be a display of the highest quality martial arts. His skills, and those of his antagonists, provide detailed and polished confrontations that are simply thrilling. And I love those needles!The pace of the film is excellent too. The action just keeps coming.  There is just enough talking and character interaction to keep the plot alive and well. Bridget Fonda manages well in a role I think was not really designed for her. She is one of those actors who always finds her character and makes it work. The film is violent, to be sure. And the bad guys are the worst. Their blatant, public methods are almost too much to believe. Still, the pace of the action leaves one little time to ponder details. One element I wish the director had left out is Jet Li dodging about a thousand rounds of full auto gunfire. Everyone seems compelled to shoot such scenes, but two guns raking rounds across the hotel lobby could not possibly miss. It is virtually enfilade fire, and no one could get through that. Otherwise, the firearms action was believable and thrilling to watch. Even the music, though not my style, seems to work well with the action. The director puts it all together in a wild ride I can recommend to any action film fan.

I expect most of these Hong Kong martial-arts films to be packed with action but most feature either a little humor (Jackie Chan) or beautiful scenery ("Hero," etc.) or wild special effects ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and more).....but this one features a mean edge. I'm not used to seeing these Asian films with a lot of profanity (mainly f-words) or bloody scenes almost to the point of being gross, which one scene was in here.The hero is likable guy played by Jet Li. Despite his martial arts penchant for violence, he has a soft, boyish look to him and doesn't seem to fit the type. He's always the gentleman in here, with no profanity either. The villains, led by Tchecky Karyo, are brutal. Bridget Fonda, playing a hooker, at least wasn't some "Pretty Woman" type figure. She was rough, too, but at least realistic and I give her credit for not worrying about how she looked in here, beauty-wise.I don't regret seeing this film. It was entertaining, but beware: it's a rough movie.

What do you want from a Jet Li movie? By the time of Kiss Of The Dragon being released, many of his fans had been vociferous about how his film's were losing realism in the fight scenes. Here, teaming up with Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen in the writing room, Li himself set about readdressing the balance for American produced martial artistry. The result is of course a preposterous plot that should duly have been expected, but without doubt for action fans this is a real high kicker that delivers thrill after thrill as Li beats up Paris.The plot simply sees Li as Chinese intelligence agent Liu Siu-jian who is sent to Paris to aid in the apprehension of a Chinese drug lord. Things go belly up when corrupt cops led by Insp. Richard {Tchéky Karyo} wipe out the target and frame Liu Siu-jian for the murder. But he ain't going to take it on the chin. So with the help of prostitute witness Jessica Kamen (Bridget Fonda), he sets about clearing his name whilst perhaps helping Jessica get her life back on track too. Cue the odd couple forming a tender relationship as they shift from one death defying encounter to another.The action on offer here is excellently put together, there's minimal CGI and even less wire work involved. This is stunts and martial artistry produced by a master craftsman. From a unique use of a snooker ball to an exhilarating smack down with a class of martial arts students, and on to a tag team scrap with the blonde twins, this has enough biff and bam to fill the Louvre itself. Li is on fire, not only one of the toughest guys on the planet, but also one of the coolest. While Fonda is hugely touching in a stereotypical role and Karyo continues to be one of the best psycho actors in the new millennium.Flaws and plot holes here? Of course. Does it matter in a buttock kicking action movie? Course not. 7.5/10

KISS OF THE DRAGON / (2001) *** (out of four) By Blake French:	I admire "Kiss of the Dragon" because it's a wake-up call to the increasingly desperate genre of martial arts action movies. After disasters like "Romeo Must Die" and any recent Jackie Chan production, my expectations for "Kiss of the Dragon" were not exactly sky high. It seems as if every movie like this replaces a story and characters with silly special effects and high-tech action sequences involving martial arts fighting. Here, there are solid, visible characters and an involving story. That's a real accomplishment these days.	Jet Li starred in 25 successful Asian films before making his debut in America as the villain in the lackluster "Lethal Weapon 4." His last film, "Romeo Must Die," was a pitiful action extravaganza that borrowed elements from Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet." Before this film, I could not stand this martial artist turned actor. Here, he makes a strong name for himself. He co-produces the film, stars in it, and created the original story. According the production notes, Li initially envisioned a dramatic film that combined his trademark martial arts and action heroics with strong, recognizable characters.  	"I wasn't interested in making a movie about a big action hero who saves the day," explains Li. "My character, Liu Jiuan, is one of China's best agents, with tremendous abilities in martial arts and acupuncture. He's determined and driven. But he's not a superman; he's human. When his mission goes wrong, Liu initially doesn't know how to handle things."
	Liu Jiuan is the most skilled law enforcer in China brought to Paris on a top secret mission where he must assist an unorthodox police official named Richard (Tcheky Karyo) in dealings involving some off the record drug traffic. His mission goes awry and he quickly learns that Richard, who seemingly has a limitless supply of henchmen, is the villainous mastermind behind most of the crime in France. Liu becomes trapped in a dangerous conspiracy-Richard frames him for a murder he tried to stop. Liu also becomes involved with a local American woman named Jessica (Bridget Fonda), who was forced into prostitution when Richard kidnapped her child. The story feels real, instead of a clothesline for countless gratuitous action sequences. There are plenty of action sequences, however, and the fighting does not involve wires, phony stunts, or computer generated effects like in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," and "The Matrix." The fights are grounded and real. "We went back to the basics," explains Jet Li, "keeping the fighting simple and based more in reality." Liu's principle fighting weapons are not guns or swords, but acupuncture needles, which play an important role in the mysterious "kiss of the dragon" revealed at the movie's climax. "Kiss of the Dragon" is directed by French commercial director Chris Nohan in his feature film debut. He does a good job of involving the audience in the action, and distracting us from some of the film's weaknesses. But no director could conceal some of the bad writing, terrible dialogue, unanswered questions, plausible motives, and stereotypical character traits. "Kiss of the Dragon" is not a great movie, but for Jet Li, this is good stuff nonetheless.

I just watched Kiss Of The Dragon after not watching this for decades. I have a slightly better opinion of it than I had originally. Granted for story or character development, Kiss Of The Dragon falls a bit flat. However, this gets an A+ for action and it still is a step up and a better movie than Romeo Must Die. Jet Li is in top form here and he showcases his fighting skills well to western audiences with Kiss Of The Dragon. Corey Yuen does a fantastic job at putting together these elaborate and highly entertaining fight sequences together that are mostly devoid of wirework or CGI. The movie as a whole is fairly predictable with some pretty lame villains and heavies. However, the tone of the film is very serious and Jet has great screen presence and charisma to carry this. To say this pales to measure up to most of his (until more recent work) in Chinese cinema may be true. But this is far from his worst. The fights and action are worth the price of admission and make it easy to overlook the film's flaws.

Kiss of the Dragon is a hyperactive martial arts movie with a heavy European feel. After Jet Li's fans were left disappointed with the fake, CGI-enhanced fighting in Romeo Must Die he decided to go back to practical, hand-to-hand combat with literally no strings attached. KOTD is the perfect excuse for action, with minimal plot and impossible odds.Basically, Jet Li plays a Chinese cop Lui Jian who travels to Paris to help the police bring a crime boss to justice. But the French police just happen to be heavily, heavily corrupt and kill Mr. Big, framing Lui Jian in the process. Keen to stay alive, Lui Jian flees the scene, but not before screaming, mad and completely hat stand police inspector Richard (Tcheky Caryo in his typically delirious role) sends just about every hardened police psycho after him. Outrageously outnumbered, Lui Jian prevails and fights his way through swarms and swarms of thugs out for his blood. Using only his hands and feet (and any useful nearby tool) he manages to wipe them all out.Far-fetched it may be, but action choreographer Cory Yuen shoots it all in the most realistic and stylish way. You really will believe Lui Jian is capable of such an impossible feat, that's how realistic the action is. And all without glamorising guns.KOTD uses the rule of increasingly mad set-pieces. The first desperate escape through the corridors and passageways of the hotel, the death-defying escape from the Seine Barge and through the tunnels and sewers, the orphanage confrontation and (especially) the final scene in the police station where Lui Jian takes on a dojo full of martial artist police officers, evil twins and finally Inspector Richard. It's all breathtaking stuff and very, very violent. With far too many sanitised PG-13 minded 'action' movies abundant these days KOTD is a breath of hardcore fresh air.If you like this then I suggest checking out The Transporter. It may be slightly tamer but it's made by the same people (producer Luc Besson, Writer Robert Mark Kamen and Cory Yuen) and is also set in France, only with a warmer, more exotic look.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a great Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. There are some extras and a commentary if you're into that sort of thing.

Jet Li produced this movie together with Luc Besson. Director/Producer Luc Besson is known for his love for violence. Fortunately that violence is often portrayed in a cartoon like fashion, which makes the violent scenes bearable and even funny. However this time the violence sometimes is just too gross, unfit for a movie like this. Not suited for those beneath 16 years of age. The story of a violent chief of police isnt credible either in the violent way it is portrayed here. So it doenst serve any purpose besides shock value. That is my only criticism of this kung fu fight movie, besides some other flaws in the story that just arent believable either. It could have been much better, with less gross violence and a bit more credibility in the story. Now it barely rises above a good B movie.Still I really enjoyed it. And don't get me wrong, the kung fu fighting scenes are excellent! It is just a few other violent scenes that are distasteful. But enough said about the violence, let's talk about the wonderful performance of the lovely Bridget Fonda, in her second to last role of her carreer. She is to die for in her role as a prostitute who comes to the aid of a chinese cop played by Jet Li. Together they have to bring down a corrupt chief of police who runs a prostitute organisation. Not that the story matters much, it is just a contineous fighting barrage intertwined with exciting chases. Although there are lots of pauses, which gives the characters of Jet Li and Bridget Fonda time to interact with eachother.
Their acting really makes this movie rise far above the average kung fu movie. Summarizing: the story has some flaws which make the sum total fall flat a bit. Still very enjoyable. I will wanna see it again. 7 stars. Could have been 8 stars though with a more credible story...

Kiss of the Dragon is an action vehicle for Jet Li, a Chinese intelligence agent sent to Paris to help apprehend Chinese mob boss, Mr Big.He meets Inspector Jean-Pierre Richard (Tchéky Karyo), a corrupt French police detective and tricks Liu into believing he is simply providing reconnaissance of a meet involving Mr Big when he is planning to use two prostitutes as a rouse to kill Mr Big and frame Li for it.Li realises he has been set up.He escapes from the hotel with a surveillance tape showing Richard shooting Mr Big and tries to clear his name. Along the way he encounters an American prostitute little knowing that their paths have crossed before.The story for this film was from Jet Li and it was produced by Luc Besson. It is primarily a martial arts action fight film for Li without much CGI or wire work and Li really delivers.From Besson you get that what is now a trademark Besson style of an outsider entering France and getting involved in a mystery and action. Where bad guys need to be dispatched with assistance from usually a female. It is almost a prototype Taken film.The best fight sequence is in the police training room when Li is taken aback to discover they are doing karate training.However the film has too many lapses of logic. Karyo is a great bad guy but we see him shoot civilians out in the open, surely someone would twig he is corrupt.We also have scenes of someone shooting at Li from a hotel lobby with two machine guns and again no one from the French Police raises questions.Bridget Fonda looks miscast as the prostitute and it would had been better if her character was French.

I was hoping this movie to be better than 'Romeo Must Die' and I was not disappointed. I truly believe this is Jet Li's English coming out movie (too bad it was released in the summer when other bigger movies come out).I did not go to see the movie for the story line and those who don't won't be disappointed either. The action was great especially the final scenes. Bridget Fonda did not do much (found her irritating in some scenes) but then again, did not watch the movie because she was there.Believable, maybe not ... Jet Li as the new Bruce Lee, most definitely!8/10

Liu Jian (Jet Li) travels to Paris from his native China to stop a drug kingpin and get to the bottom of his illegal doings in France. A top cop in his home country, Liu utilizes his amazing Martial Arts abilities to bring the baddies to justice. But he meets his match in the super-evil Richard (Karyo), who commands an army of goons, who in turn keep a stable of his prostitutes - all the while leading a double life as the head of the Vice Squad in Paris. As Liu tries to keep his bearings while in this foreign land, fighting Richard's goons at every turn, he reluctantly teams up with one of his prostitutes, Jessica (Fonda) in the search for answers. It seems Richard is keeping Jessica's daughter locked in an orphanage as leverage so she won't spill the beans on his many, many illegal activities. His criminal empire seemed impenetrable...but he never had to contend with Liu Jian! Will justice be served, and will Jessica get her daughter back? Find out today...Kiss of the Dragon is fast-paced fun, with a lot of the typically-excellent Martial Arts Jet Li is known for. It has a lot of lively, quick fights and is loaded with very impressive stunts. It's all very cool and slick. It has a nice, professional look and has tons of action - as well as a likable hero and a very evil baddie. Just those things alone put it head and shoulders above a lot of other movies of this kind. There is minimal CGI and wirework - it's mostly all-real fights (with a couple of exceptions, of course). We appreciated the idea of Liu's "acupuncture bracelet", and the fact that he has some knock-down, drag-out fights with guys that resemble Street Fighter characters Guile and Balrog. The Guile guy is even seen reading a "Where's Waldo?" book at one point. We know this came out in 2001, but if that's not 90's, we don't know what is. Of course, all of this is highly reminiscent of The Replacement Killers (1998) of a few years previously. While that was a Hollywood vehicle for Chow Yun-Fat, this is for Jet Li. Instead of teaming up with Mira Sorvino, here it's Bridget Fonda, and instead of Jurgen Prochnow as the baddie, here it's Karyo. Needless to say, if you liked one, you will like the other. We also welcomed the fact that it was really Paris we were seeing, not Bulgaria masquerading as Paris, or some green-screen fakery. Nowhere was this more evident than on the boat fight scene, which is clearly on the Seine, and you cannot fake what they did. Maybe we've watched too many Seagal movies, but we loved the change of scenery. As with Contract Killer (1998), Cradle 2 the Grave (2003), and Romeo Must Die (2000), the filmmakers have decided to pair Jet Li with rap beats. In this case we have not one, but TWO songs by Mystikal. While it certainly places the movie in a particular time period, we kind of wish it wasn't Mystikal. What, were Jadakiss and Silkk tha Shocker songs unavailable? Also, it should be noted that Richard, the bad guy, is so evil, he keeps a turtle in his desk drawer. Another thing we noticed was that in the scene where Liu and Jessica go to the orphanage, the floor and room number where the daughter can be found is "B13". District B13 (2004) is also a France-set Martial Arts extravaganza, and a Luc Besson production. This must have some significance to him. It was just a little thing we noticed. Kiss of the Dragon is an entertaining ride that is well worth watching. The great Jet Li is in top form and a pleasant time will be had by all who view it.

All in all a nice action flick, a dark atmosphere and some nice villains, who obviously must die by the hand of the Jet. What is wrong about this movie is the way it is filmed, you can see Jet Li throwing some moves, but you can't see them right!! What a waste, the camera is too close, the shots are too short, it looks like MTV sometimes. Still this movie outranks the abysmal 'Romeo must die', so you could say Jet Li's non-asian movies are getting better. If you want to see Jet Li doing some nice moves in a western movie, check out Lethal Weapon 4, that movie isn't very good either but at least it allows you to see what Jet Li can do. Hopefully 'the One' will get it right in being a decent action flick directed by someone who knows how to film martial arts scenes.

Kiss of the Dragon' might be just another action/martial arts' movie that is sitting on the shelf of your local video store. However once you start to watch it, you will realise that like some of its characters, it is a movie that is very deceptive and will leave you breathless. With the screenplay based on the story written by star Jet Li himself, this film has moments that no-one could ever comprehend seeing. While Li might be criticised for being one dimensional' in his movie roles, it has to be said that he is one of the best martial arts actors going around at the present time.Liu, a Chinese intelligence officer, goes to Paris on assignment and becomes embroiled in a deadly conspiracy. When the man he has come to help betrays him, he is forced on the run, accused of a murder he didn't commit. He teams up with Jessica, an American woman forced into prostitution against her will, who wants to escape and seek justice. As Jessica and Liu go up against cunning and ruthless adversaries, Liu makes a promise to Jessica that could compromise his career, even his life.The star of this film is Liu (Jet Li), who is an expert Chinese cop sent to stop an international drug conspiracy. He is traveling to the city of Paris for the first time, making it totally alien to him. Liu carries only a gun and needles which are rapt around his wrist. These are acupuncture needles, which he has the skill to use, to help heal his friends or kill his enemies. The finale action sequence has Liu refer to the title of the film, whereby the use of a needle technique called Kiss of the Dragon', which is highly illegal, as it must be, which can disrupt the body's blood flow, making all the blood travel to the head and then killing the person as it tries to escape from whatever cavity it can. This scene was astonishing to see being played out.The supporting cast in Kiss of the dragon' consists of Jessica (beauty Bridget Fonda), a girl who is forced to take drugs and be a prostitute by French Police inspector Richard (Tcheky Karyo). You do not refuse Richard, as the consequences could be fatal. He has many henchmen that are on the lookout for John' (Liu), as he has the evidence that could destroy Richard. Along the way Jessica meets up with Liu and they help each other out of sticky situations that have arisen. I enjoy the role taken on by Fonda a lot, as her character gives the story its emotion and balance whereby she helps Liu get around Paris.  I like how and where this movie was presented. The director shows off Paris in many ways, such as landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, which is cleverly incorporated through a fighting sequence. The director Chris Nahon was able to do this, via producer and screenwriter Luc Besson's help in getting leading cinematographer Thierry Arbogast, who did some great work. While the story might be simple on the surface, who can complain when there is such great action scenes to compensate.This then leads me into Kiss of the dragon's' action and stunts which are exhilarating. Li's character has many fighting sequences that you would believe he has no hope of winning. The start of the film makes uncertain of what is going to happen, then in the blink of an eye you are presented with action and stunts that will leave you speechless. The one scene at the start which shows Liu slamming a billiard ball to kill a villain was unbelievable. Then the fighting scenes at the shop, boat, office building and orphanage are full-on, making them intoxicating to the viewers. However one of the final fighting scenes with Liu taking on a whole class of Black belts is hilarious, as you know he is going to win. Kiss of the Dragon' works, because where the story is lacking, the action and fighting scenes take up the slack. Jet Li has done some good movies, such as `Lethal Weapon 4' and Romeo Must Die' where he shows off all his martial art skills. If you have not seen him in either of those films, then watch them by all means. Finally, I want to mention that I have had many treatments of acupuncture in 2002 which have helped me immensely. However, when I have my next treatment of those little needles' I might squirm a bit, being quick to remember what Liu could do with an acupuncture needle.
CMRS gives Kiss of the Dragon': 4 (Very Good Film)

This film seems to skip much of a plot and starts out in the middle of a story that you never really get to find out what is going on.  The action is fairly good but it would have been a much better movie if it had a better plot.  You never find out why a murder occured, why a main character was involved, why people are being framed, why there is hostility between governments, why the evil person is in power, or why the prostitute and her daughter are in the situation they are in, etc.  It is almost like walking in to the middle of a movie and missing the first half of it because of this all the undeveloped and unfished plot.  I'd give this movie a score of 6 out of 10.

This is as good as a violent action movie can get. I am not a fan of martial art movies, and would probably have avoided it, if it was not produced by Luc Besson (director of the original 'Nikita' and of the '5th Element') and acted among other by the excellent Bridget Fonda and Tcheky Karyo. I was not disappointed by their acting, by the way, and even the martial arts star was not bad at all. The story of the Chinese cop framed by his French counterparts in a murder and drugs intrigue has not too much logic, but what logic can you expect from such a movie - when a full hotel and a tourist boat are destroyed in matter of minutes, and dozens of bodies head gladly to the Garden of Eden for the 'pleasure' of the viewer. Pleasure it is indeed if you can put common sense aside, watch and enjoy the choreography of the fights, the various and creative ways people seem to die, and the well filmed Paris landscape, now theater for the real life (should I say real death?) Far Eastern martial arts wars. Interestingly enough, the French play the role of the bad guys in the movie, while the Chinese are the good ones - this must be some kind of concession to penetrate the big Far East market. The film gets 7/10 on my scale, the best I can grade this type of cinematographic entertainment.

Liu Jian (Jet Li) is a Chinese policeman sent to France to help with the apprehension of big-time Chinese drug lord. But Jian is quickly double-crossed and finds himself on the run having been accused of murder. The one person who may be able to help him is a drug-addicted prostitute whose child is being held hostage by the same man who set-up Jian - and he's a high-ranking French policeman. Jian and the prostitute make for an unlikely pair, but they'll have to work together to make things right.As an action movie, Kiss of the Dragon gets several things right. Both Jet Li and Bridget Fonda are more than capable of pulling off this kind of movie. Li, in particular, is exceptionally good showing the moves that have made him an internationally acclaimed martial arts star. He does a lot of different moves in the movie but my particular favorite is a quick one involving a pool ball that he sends flying with a well placed foot. Unfortunately, beyond the two stars and a wickedly evil performance by Tchéky Karyo, the rest of the movie is pretty average. It's one action/martial arts cliché after then next with the child being held hostage the icing on the cake. The only action standard the movie fails to include is letting the male and female leads fall in love with each other. And I'm glad because that would have really ruined the movie. As it is, Kiss of the Dragon is a harmless enough time waster that may lack creativity, but benefits from the presence of Jet Li.

Jet Li is the Man. Without Jet Li, Chris Nahon' "Kiss of the Dragon" would be a forgettable action exercise. To his credit director, Chris Nahon, brings to the screen the most realistic, controlled, brutal, and unforgiving martial arts fight sequences to date-- "Enter the Dragon" quality. And the Bruce Lee comparison to Li does apply. There is no wasted motion here. All the fight sequences, particularly one set in the martial arts dojo, are concise, expedient, and without mercy. It's what martial arts is intended to be given that the best choice is not to fight at all, if not then it is to end the fight quickly and definitively. Jet Li executes with speed, power, and precision. He is world class. He is not pulling his blows much-- if any. Li has a powerful screen presence. What works for him is the understated persona, and someone you just don't f--- with. When his character, "Johnny" says "Don't do that again...", only a fool wouldn't listen. Good for the movie, there are a lot of stupid people in it The story by Li, along with Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, starts off simple, then more or less becomes background. Li plays a Beijing cop Liu Jian, on assignment in Paris to investigate a Chinese businessman. Jian (or Johnny) is framed for the murder of the businessman by the French cop heading the investigation, Richard (Tcheky Karyo). Through a chance encounter, Johnny befriends the hooker who witnessed the murder- this is Jessica played sympathetically and effectively by Bridget Fonda. Fonda looks great here-- even playing a hooker. Turns out that Jessica is a heroin junkie strung out on Investigator Richard's payroll, who is also holding her daughter. Johnny must clear his name and gives Jessica his word that he will save her daughter. This is just great hero stuff... There is an quiet moment in the movie where Jessica says to Johnny, "I trusted you..."--i.e. 'you disappointed me.' Being a man of honor, he will honor his word like life or death. This maybe Jet Li's breakthrough movie. His Johnny is a quiet man of his word, and someone who is willing to die for it. He is a classic hero here. Bridget Fonda gives depth to a thinly written character-- she plays it with heart and smarts. All around this a good summer movie. Be in awe of the prowess and talents of Jet Li, and don't think about the story too much... Really...

Martial Arts Movie for Action Fans with Jet Li in Hyperdrive and the Carnage Never Stops. This is Comic-Book Stuff with Our (Super) Hero Displaying Powers Absent in Mortal Men. It is All Ramped Up, Over the Top, Very Violent, and the Movie Takes No Prisoners.Luc Besson from Behind the Scenes Delivers, Along with His Superstar Jet Li, an Action Movie that Pulls No Punches and is a Ride-Along of Ridiculous Fight Scenes that are Always a Hoot for Fans of this Type of Stuff. There is Plenty of Bang for the Buck.The French Detective can go a Few Beats too Far Pushing His Subordinates Around and Bridget Fonda as the Human Anchor Whore with a Heart of Gold and a Cute as a Button Daughter in Tow, May be at Least One Beat too Good to be True, but there had to be Something to Pause the Mayhem. She Does, but Only a Brief Pause and We're Back to Kicking Ass.Overall, with Very Little Wire Work, Jet Li Fans can File Back in Lock Step, and Action Movie Adrenaline Types will have Very Little to Gripe About. It is Nonsensical, Bone Crushing, Bloodletting with its Heart Buried Beneath the Brutality, but it is Pumping the Pathos Enough to Allow Some Humanity to Contrast the Otherwise Inhuman Villains.No Compromises Here, this is One that Delivers what it is Selling in an Ultra-Stylistic Ballet of Blood, Bone Snapping, and Bullets and it is One of Jet Li's Best.

Lets face it any one who watches a movie featuring Luc besson and/or Jet Li watches it for constant thrill a minute action with a little bit of humour and some emotional moments (courtesy luc besson). No fan of either expects an epical action movie spanning over three hours and thousands of extras.Keeping this in mind this movie is copy perfect movie from both the stars, lots of kung fu action, the usual drama involving the missfit of society with the slightest hint of love, this movie is signature work from both.The rest of the cast plays their part Bridget Fonda looks lovely and carries of the role as "ex-junkie hooker, with a child" with an innocence that is quite endearing.Tchéky Karyo who has proved himself as a brilliant actor maintains his high standards. The character artists are also again quite perfect which reminds me:-although its hard to logically so many people doing Kung Fu in France Luc Besson has a brilliant scene in the film that justifies so many of the people knowing kung fu and also why the twin hit men did. This particular scene was also quite a lovable scene and another signaturish scene in the movie.The Only Things thats going against the movie is the lack of a REALLY big action scene (something that we come to expect from luc) and the fact that Jet Li has not yet come around to playing his age (come on man if you look the age then play it, there is no reason you cannot be a action star who looks 35-40 p.s there is no hint of him acting young in this movie but its something occurred to me).All in all a movie thats gives you exactly what you expect, short and sweet, a must watch for fans of luc and jet.

This is one of the dumbest movies I have seen. What little plot there is relies mainly on the fight scenes to tie the movie together. Basically, the movie jumps from one fight scene to the next, each one more unbelievable. It gets to be a bit tiresome watching one guy fighting a roomful of adversaries while each bad guy politely waits untilits his turn to get knocked around. Shades of Chuck Norris! The story is written in the typically heavy-handed far eastern style which makes all westerners into either bad guys or ignorant bumpkins. After watching for a while, I actually got bored with the whole thing.One more point about this movie (and this applies to others as well): People who know nothing about guns should not be allowed to make movies that depict guns and actors who don't know how to use a gun properly should not be allowed to act in them.

This is an excellent Jet Li film, that is really intense, with lots of great action, and fantastic performances!. This is a really intense film, that actually has quite a few shocking moments, and pulls no punches, plus Jet Li is simply amazing in this!. Theis film really has some fantastic fight scenes, in it and the plot and story was really cool, plus i found the ending very touching!. I was really rooting for the 2 main characters as Tchéky Karyo is actually frightening as the main villain, and wanted to see what was coming to him!, plus it also had some good dialog!. The character development isn't too bad, and the finale is great and full of action, plus, i was really surprised by all the violence!. This is an excellent Jet Li Film that is really intense, with lots of great action, and fantastic performances!. The Direction is great!. Chris Nahon does a great job here, with excellent camera work, great shots during the action scenes, and really keeping the film at a fast pace!. There is actually quite a bit of blood and violence!. We get harsh bloody beating, bloody gunshot wounds, bloody gunshot wound to the head with blood and brains splattering,bloody stabbings,decapitation, chopsticks in neck, and a very nasty death scene at the end which i won't spoil. The Acting is fantastic!. Jet Li is AMAZING as always, and is AMAZING here, he does not speak much, but he is very believable, likable, had very good chemistry with Bridget Fonda, kicked that ass, and was just amazing overall (Jet Rules!). Bridget Fonda is very beautiful and is excellent as the prostitute, she is very likable, had very good chemistry with jet and i was rooting for her all the way to get her daughter back!. Tchéky Karyo is extremely menacing as the main villain, and at times frightening he was awesome!. Rest of the cast are good. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5

Perhaps we have come back to where we started as Jet Li takes up the mantle of the great Oriental martial arts heroes.Li is excellent in his role as the police officer who has come to France to assist the Police in Paris with a conspiracy.  Things turn sour for him, and, along with the excellent Fonda [who gets better by the film] he has to take control and investigate for himself or lose his own life.Well directed and with some brilliantly choreographed action scenes, this is definitely one to see.

I was a little disappointed with this one.  I was hoping for a better plot and story line.  The story line of Kiss of the Dragon was predictable and not presented very well.  The martial arts were generally very good and only a few areas where the choreography was problematic.  This only occurred in the most complex scenes.  This is the only part of the film that kept it from getting a rating lower than 5 from me.  What really hurt the movie was the French inspector, Richard played by Tcheky Karyo.  I normally like the characters he plays but either he was not directed well or he just chose a bad script.  His character was not believable.  I don't care what country you are in, you are not going to be able to kill as many people in the open has he did and still be a cop!  You simply don't have that much power, especially in a western nation like France.  Your superiors will catch on and will remove you.  Some may say he could but not to this degree. 
I like Jet Li and was hoping for more with this film.  I am glad I waited until it came out of video.Overall, okay, but it has some significant problems (5 out of 10).
