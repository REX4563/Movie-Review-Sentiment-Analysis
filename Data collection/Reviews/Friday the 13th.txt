I'll concede right off that it's very hard to be objective in reviewing this movie. The truth is I've never seen it until today, but it's spawned so many sequels and become such a part of popular culture (for better or worse) that it's stamped into your mind whether you've seen it or not. Trying to be objective I'd say - it's not bad. It's not as good as what I would consider to be the classic of the slasher movies (1978's Halloween) but it has some moments of pretty good suspense and somewhat surprisingly to me I found that it wasn't a "gore-fest." There's violence and blood but the murders, while they're portrayed, tend to be shown quickly and the movie moves on fairly quickly. The setting is used pretty well to create atmosphere - the movie is set in a remote camp about to be re-opened after being closed for over 20 years following the murders of two counsellors in 1958. Those murders kick off the movie. There's some decent camera-work, as the camera serves as the eyes of the killer, and at times that effect is used when the camera isn't being used as the eyes of the killer, so there's a bit of uncertainty for the viewer. It is a bit of a chuckle that this movie uses as its setting the classically bad opening of terrible novels ("it was a dark and stormy night.")The performances were OK, if a little bit forced and artificial at times. Adrienne King did a good job near the end of the movie as the terrified Alice. Kevin Bacon had a role in this as Jack, but it wasn't the lead role, and aside from him no one from the movie rose to any significant stature in Hollywood and there was certainly no Jamie Lee Curtis (see Halloween) among the female leads, although there were many shots of young and cute women in various stages of undress!Strange to say, but in some ways knowing the basic outline of how the series progresses adds to the suspense at the end of the movie as to the identity of the killer, and does get you wondering how the heck this is going to lead to sequels - or at least to the sequels it led to, although Alice's last line ("then he's still out there") clearly establishes that those responsible for the movie were already looking ahead to the sequels. Not having been really interested in the series before this, I will confess that, having seen the first instalment, I now have a certain curiosity to see how the second instalment is constructed. 7/10

Friday the 13th (1980) kicked started the early 80's slasher film phenomenon that was ignited by Halloween (1978) but fueled intensely by this reworking of the Mario Bava classic "Twitch of the Death Nerve". Once Friday the 13th was released, there was no turning back. The slasher film was part of the American horror film genre and it would remain that way for years to come. A film that launched countless knock-offs, wannabes, sequels and a t.v. series?! Camp Crystal Lake and the Friday the 13th film franchise are a part of Americana. The film is merely a stage for the splatter effects of F/X maestro Tom Savini. They were later toned down for it's American release and were softened even further during it's video release.The movie itself isn't that great. Technically it's boring. To get the most out of the film you have to watch it uncut. Friday the 13th was designed around Savini's gory set pieces. Watching them with out it is like drinking a mayonnaise soda. I encourage you to seek out the uncut version of this film. Recommended.A (uncut)D (American version)

Without a doubt, the work of Cunningham and Carpenter during 1978 & 1980 rocked the world of the horror genre. Friday the 13th is one of the films that to this day still has repercussions. It demonstrated the importance of setting the tone in horror movies, making the audience themselves feel as if they too were being stalked. Cunningham also was one of the few directors to introduce the idea of a possible female serial killer.Without this film, Scream's Randy would have never uttered those famous words, 'There are certain rules to surviving a horror movie..' This film combined with Carpenter's Halloween, firmly etched the rules in stone. The creepy music, the infamous "ch-ch-ch-ha-ha-ha", the crude photography and the graphic depiction of the murders of the counsellors all blend together to give a classic piece of film history. It scared the hell out of multitudes of teenagers who, in many instances could see themselves in the victims of the stalker. These weren't bad people getting killed, these were just your typical average American kids, having a good time, getting picked off.That is what makes this film so defining, that is why, for all its crude and harsh imagery, this is a classic. This is why alot of recent attempts at horror don't measure up. It's not the effects or the blood necessarily, it's the atmosphere and the familiarity that bring it home.It is more frightening to think, "That could be me"

Personally this one isn't my favorite slasher film, My Bloody Valentine from 1981 is. But Friday the 13th has its moments.Camp Crystal Lake has a killer out there... who could it be? No one knows, and there are some teens going there to reopen the campground for children joining up for the summer. The old coot at the local store warns otherwise but no one listens. When the truth is discovered, along with the tragic story of a drowned little boy, one girl is left fighting for her life.Friday the 13th has average scenery, mainly rural homes and trees. The acting is decent and I love the soundtrack. It isn't all that original and it had a number of other movies stealing the camp killer idea (the Burning and Sleepaway Camp), but still, Friday the 13th manages to be entertaining all the way through. I don't really understand the need for its many sequels, but it did very well as a cult film over the years and has remained a favorite within the slasher genre for years.

The sub-genre of horror, often hit or miss, has divided horror movie lovers ever since it became mainstream in 1970s. Personally, slashers can be really good if they're done right, with a good story, scares, nice atmosphere, and memorable scenes. This one has it all, and that's why it is so popular even today.Along with other influential slasher classics of the 1970s, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and Black Christmas, they created iconic horror villains many TV shows and films try to copy or spoof.I've watched this one a couple of times, when I was a kid, teenager, young adult, all with different people, and it never gets old or boring. The atmosphere of summer camp in the late 1970s is perfect and nostalgic. Music to create tension is great. Acting is okay, with majority of actors being surprisingly good, if you consider time it was released.Friday the 13th franchise is perfect fun for summer nights, or to watch through month of Halloween!

In a full moon night of a Friday, 13th, the instructors of Camp Crystal Lake are murdered, one by one, in a night of terror. In the end of the story, a convincing explanation clarifies what have happened. This cult movie was very original and spooky in 1980. Placed basically in one location and with unknown young actors and actresses, it was indeed a successful low budget movie, copied many times in other films. Today I have just watched it again, now on a recently released DVD, and it is still good to see. I regret the sequels, since the story is very well resolved in a credible way without supernatural. This way, it is much more terrifying and could have stopped right here. My vote is seven.

Friday the 13th. The movie which turned around the horror genre and gave us one of the most unforgettable villains and endings, is, and always will be a horror classic. Friday the 13th doesn't set out to be glossy and glamorous. Friday the 13th sets out to do what it wants to do; and that is, make you sit on the edge of your seat, feel uncomfortable and unnerved, to make you frightened when you go to bed after watching it. Friday the 13th delivers all of the fantastic horror goods. The plot revolves around American teenagers, who are the new counsellors at the apparently jinxed Camp Crystal Lake. These naive, horny youngsters have a one-track mind and break all of the innocent borders which has more depth than you would think. Basically, the message is "Don't have pre-marital sex, or you'll die" just like many of Friday the 13th's predecessors and clones send out as well. Friday the 13th has a variety of characters, all who you could possibly relate to. These characters are then slowly followed and hacked off one by one, in dark, gory, claustrophobic manners, which may leave you frightened in the same way Psycho made showers scary. As the camp counsellors are knocked off one by one, the tension rises higher and higher. Along the journey of carnage, the hugely effective soundtrack really creeps under your skin, highlighting how jumpy and scary the events happening on screen really are. For example when a chase scene occurs, the music may speed up, the tempo rising and jittering, almost moving like the characters on screen are. The acting in Friday the 13th is not bad at all; some of the actors/actresses may be a little amateur, but there is nothing terrible in this picture. The settings are also very effective. The stalkings and slaying in broad daylight and open spaces are a twist in a new direction, showing that not everything has to happen in the dark, in a small isolated house on the top of a hill, so the variation of location makes forests, cabins and even lakes more unappealing to the viewers afterwards, and may leave them creeped out by the aforementioned places. The camera-work is also very effective. The way the camera 'stalks' the victim behind trees and bushes, and the way the camera chases after it's victims as the point of view of the villain is unique and exciting, and adds a more tense and faster chill to the movie. Friday the 13th may play as a clich√©d slasher, a story of sex equalling carnage, but it plays so effectively well it is a too important horror movie to simply be dismissed. It collects everything appealing about the 80's horror genre and wraps it up neatly into this fantastic horror package. A classic in it's genre.

This film is not the best movie of all time, but it's still good. I found that some parts we slept a little, but it comes just 3 or 4 minutes of bored, the rest is quite significant and also almost scary (but do not go too far either). This is not the film that makes the most fear in the world, but I have to admit that some parts were the heart beating fast enough. The murderer of the first part is quite disappointing when compared with the murderer of following components of the franchise. I find it is not as though his Halloween rival, but each his own.Good movie !!!

Friday the 13th is a classic masterpiece, it uses a clever sort of storytelling to hide the identity of the killer as well as who the main character is to the end. For a slasher movie, it's not as bloody as a modern slasher, but it still delivers brutal kills. The music and sound effects are all great. The suspense-building is great as you can kinda figure out when someone's is going to get murdered. And without spoiling anything, the acting of the killer is truly terrifying! Some acting is kind of cheesy but that doesn't change mutch. It has a great atmosphere and after rewatching it, Friday the 13th from 1980 is now one of my favourite horror movies of all time! Overall it's a must see movie with a score of 9/10 from me!

A group of camp counselors, a young Kevin Bacon among them, are busy trying to re-open Camp Crystal Lake years after multiple murders shut it down, despite the ravings of Crazy Ralph. They are dispatched one by one by an unseen killer. This IS a classic and always will be. Don't get me wrong as it's not perfect. But it's far from "merely a Halloween" clone which some people say. The original Halloween is a perfect classic, but let this film stand on it's own legs as it has every right to. Although I'm saddened about how shoddily Paramount seemed to put out their recent box set. Hell when New Line acquired the rights to the series, yes their Jason films suck, but at least they do right by the fans DVD-wise.Paramount could have done a great service to us by looking back at New Lin's Nightmare on Elm Street box set. It's a shame they didn't.My Grade: A- Eye Candy: Jeannine Taylor shows ta-tas and ass cleavage

Friday the 13th may not have been the first movie of its kind and the kill scenes may have been copied from other movies, but there's no denying the importance of the film. Friday the 13th is the film I see as most responsible for the slasher boom of the 80s. It and its sequels proved that horror fans were willing to pay money to see practically the same movie (with slight modifications) over and over. As I look back at it now, it seems a bit silly to me, but I was one of those who willing plopped down my money every few years for a chance to see another Friday the 13th movie.I don't see any point in going through the plot. Most horror fans know it by heart. Instead, I'll cover a few of the things I like about the movie. First, the kill scenes. Tom Savini's special effects are great. I especially like the scene where Kevin Bacon is speared from under the bed. Second, regardless of the number of times I've seen it, the film does have an atmosphere of fear about it. The repetitive music, the unseen killer, and the bodies dropping at every turn have always given me chills. Third, I enjoy the final showdown between the killer and the "final girl". I've always thought the final fight scene was a highlight of the film. Finally, and this is a personal thing, but Friday the 13th was the first movie of its type I ever saw. I hadn't seen movies like Halloween or Black Christmas when I first saw this one. Therefore, it holds a special place with me.Unfortunately, even though I'm a fan, I see problems. The biggest is the predictability of the plot. Even though Friday the 13th was made early in the slasher cycle, how hard was it to predict the outcome? Also, the characters in the movie are incredibly stupid. A lot of the murders could have been prevented if anyone at any point in the movie had demonstrated any brain power. But then it wouldn't have been so much fun.It may not be the kind of movie the more "sophisticated" horror fan admits to enjoying, but I'm not above admitting that Friday the 13th remains a favorite of mine. It's fun stuff!

It feels almost redundant to post a review of a movie as iconic as this one, but here goes. I assume 99% of people reading this have seen it already, but if not, watch out for spoilers, yo.Friday the 13th (which was almost titled Long Night at Camp Blood) may not have been anyone's pet project ‚Äî the director, Sean S. Cunningham, admitted that it was an attempt to ride off the success of John Carpenter's Halloween, which was released two years prior, and the writer, Victor Miller, wrote the script in two weeks ‚Äî but it's a cult classic for a reason. It didn't do that well when it was first released ‚Äî it made about $39 million at box office but received many negative reviews, including a particularly scathing commentary from Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert (who didn't even bother to hide the ending from readers). And, technically speaking, it's not that amazing of a movie ‚Äî some forgettable characters, mostly weak dialogue. But it continues to gain popularity even to this day.It's really a classic slasher flick. A bunch of young counselors have arrived at camp early to help set up and are murdered one by one by a mysterious killer. It's got the short shorts, the stormy night, and the obligatory sex scene (with Kevin Bacon and the stunning Jeannine Taylor, no less). But you really do feel the tension mounting as the movie progresses, partially due to the use of music by Harry Manfredini.As soon as Annie ‚Äî innocent, freckled little Annie ‚Äî gets her throat slit in the woods, I was immediately reminded of how surprisingly good the murder scenes are. They aren't over the top gory and aren't drawn out too long ‚Äî it's just a quick, efficient kill and then on to the anticipation of the next one.I liked that we never saw a hint of the killer beyond maybe their feet, or a hand on a shower curtain ‚Äî it's really effective in adding to the already tense mood, not to mention, of course, hiding the surprise reveal until the very end. Speaking of which, I really enjoyed the twist ‚Äî again, SPOILER ALERT, but y'all know this already. Having the killer be Mrs. Voorhees was just¬Ö awesome. Exacting revenge on behalf of her son, neglected by camp counselors while he drowned in the lake¬Ö brilliant. And her talking with herself ‚Äî or talking "with Jason" ‚Äî was creepily well done. It may not be my favorite classic horror movie ‚Äî of the trio (Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street), I'm wayyyy more of a Freddy girl.

as a fan of horror movies I must say that "Friday The 13th" is overrated. It's so absurd,boring,not frightening or interesting in any way. The acting is bad,very bad,the plot is stupid and the murders so predictable and lame that I almost laugh instead scare.It begins very nice but its get boring after a few minutes .I thought that this one will be a huge movie because it is so popular In the genre of horror movies, but I was really disappointed. I'll give you advice: STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!,if you want REAL horror movie you must watch THE EXORCIST. it's much better than this crap. Or if you want a slasher movie you can try "A Nightmare On Elm Street" or "Halloween".

This legendary classic 1980 slasher flick is the one that started the famous Jason Voorhees franchise. Starred Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King, this movie gives offers up plenty of gore, horny teens, and a deranged mother seeking revenge. The acting was less than satisfactory, it wasn't terrible, it's just that some of it was really cheesy at times. I did think that it took a little too long getting going, the best part was the last 40 minutes. That was when the screaming and offscreen killings and action happened. Some of the fighting and action was cheesy and kinda funny, it wasn't supposed to be though, so that's not good. At 1 point an axe rises behind a girl, and she has she the most laughable cheesy scream I've ever seen or heard, I was kinda annoyed by that, I just thought the actors could've done a lot better than that. I did enjoy Betsy Palmer's performance though. I did like that the killings occurred offscreen, so I didn't have to suffer through what most modern day horror movies do, meaning the constant full detail graphic horror violence. I like it when movies leave something to the imagination. I didn't mind seeing the somewhat bloody aftermath of the victim's bodies. So overall, just an OK horror film, enjoyed parts, and laughed at others 5/10.

Friday the 13th may have terrible dialog, mediocre actors, and a story line that has been mimicked time and time again, but it has one thing going for it: it is so damn entertaining. Anyone who's familiar with the character of Jason Vorhees but not the specifics is in for a surprise for this one. Although the whole bunch of characters are pretty one dimensional, there are some scenes that are pretty stand out. One particularly stands out, because it is the first "modern" encounter with the killer. The innocent, naive teenage girl getting a ride to the oh-so famous Camp Crystal Lake. I found it particularly terrifying when I first saw it because it's a large amount of terror- during the daytime. Many movies always stick to night time horror, but Friday the 13th is terrifying whenever it wants. It's also particularly funny to see a young Kevin Bacon. Yes, we may have seen and heard the movies/stories of camp counselors getting knocked off, but Friday the 13th made a name for itself. I must give a generous amount of props to that music and other noises, and it deservingly is cemented in pop culture(cheecheecheeahhahhahh.) This is a very entertaining movie, and although it may not be Grade A, it sure as hell can be as entertaining as one(at the worst a Grade C.)

Friday the 13th is a notorious slasher horror very much from the word go hence the multiple sequels over the years. Its also notable for an early appearance by Kevin Bacon who plays one of the camp counsellors.The film is set in Camp Crystal where a group of horny teenagers also known as camp counsellors are getting ready to refurbish Camp Crystal Lake some years after it was shut down when some people were killed.The town loon, Crazy Ralph warns the kids to get out but we see them being killed off in a gory manner by an unseen killer.What these kids have not been told that in the late 1950s a young boy named Jason drowned in the lake because the camp counsellors were too busy having sex to notice he needed help.The film has gory effects from Paul Savini. If you have seen previous films where he has been involved then there is nothing new in those throats being slashed scenes. As for the rest of the film you have kids being horny, playing strip monopoly over the course of the night but like the far superior film Halloween they are being stalked and murdered.Not all of the film takes place at night, there is an eerie scene when one person hitches a lift in a van but you kind of felt that would also had given the murderer away.I felt that for some portions of the film it was rather dull and boring. Kind of thought that some scenes were purely filler to pad out the running time.There was also a lot of stupidity by our heroine after the killer is revealed such as the killer being knocked out and our heroine decides to stop and rest for a bit!Its regarded as a low budget classic but it lacked a lot of tension and thrills but it does deliver in gore even though its now dated and even looks tame today.

I'll concede right off that it's very hard to be objective in reviewing this movie. The truth is I've never seen it until today, but it's spawned so many sequels and become such a part of popular culture (for better or worse) that it's stamped into your mind whether you've seen it or not.

Not having been really interested in the series before this, I will confess that, having seen the first instalment, I now have a certain curiosity to see how the second instalment is constructed. 7/10

I'll always have a soft-spot in my heart for the "Friday the 13th" franchise. Especially as an 80's baby/90's kid who grew up in a pop- culture environment where the psychotic hockey-masked killer Jason was known and loved by pretty much everyone... even kids like me who didn't see the films until we were older and only vaguely knew what they were about thanks to the whisperings and hints of our older siblings who were actually allowed to see the movies. (Usually renting them 2 or 3 at a time on trusty old VHS from the local Video King to watch after we younger brothers and sisters went to bed.)At the time this review is being posted, the franchise has been running strong for well over 35 years. Boasting 10 films in its original continuity, the fabulously entertaining (and dopey as heck) cross- over spin-off "Freddy VS Jason", a somewhat underrated reboot in 2009 and a planned new film due out sometime within the next year or two. But even a franchise so huge has to start with a small, humble beginning. Before the fame. Before the recognition. Before the birth of the pop-culture idol that the series spawned.Yes, it all started with a teeny-tiny production back in 1980- the original "Friday the 13th."It's almost impossible to really discuss this film critically without delving into spoiler territory (which I try to avoid in my reviews), though I will try my hardest to do so.The film revolves around a group of young Camp Counselors who are prepping the infamous Camp Crystal Lake for a reopening about 20 years after a mysterious double-murder and a tragic drowning involving a young child. However, it appears someone isn't exactly a happy camper and doesn't want Crystal Lake back in business, and this mysterious figure begins to pick off our protagonists one-by- one until a tense climax reveals the dreaded truth...It's no surprise at all that the film is essentially a glorified rip-off of the iconic slasher-horror that is John Carpenter's "Halloween." Director/Producer Sean S. Cunningham has been pretty candid about essentially wanting to create his own "roller-coaster" version of the Carpenter Classic with this film. Heck, they had ads and posters in the paper before the script was even written.But the problem I really have with the film is that it all feels so routine. Even often boring and sometimes toothless. While it may not be fair to judge it by modern standards, even for its time, it just doesn't have that much going for it. (Especially as the very same year of release, such classics as "The Shining" and the underrated "The Changeling" were chilling audiences to the bone.) It's a very aimless, meandering film, with sloppy plotting and far too much focus placed on seemingly-pointless sequences for it to attain the "roller-coast" feeling the director was going for. The first half of the film is just too much a chore to slog through. And once the horror finally kicks in, it's just the same rinse-and-repeat formula scene-after-scene, with really only a few gruesome deaths here and there to pique audience interest. All those old clich√©s and tropes that even at the time had become slightly predictable.Now, I know what you're saying- those are the things people love about these flicks. The clich√©s and the gore-galore. But it's so slowly paced and messy in this movie, it's hard to really get into it. It really isn't until the plethora of sequels that the formula is established and the pacing is tightened enough for those clich√©s and tropes to finally become fun and entertaining.As it stands, "Friday the 13th" does have its place in horror royalty. But I firmly believe it's more for spawning the long- running franchise that followed and less for the quality of the film itself.Oh, and I guess it's also kinda famous for introducing some guy named Kevin Bacon as a supporting character... but I'm not sure if he actually went anywhere after this. (Please appreciate the obvious sarcasm there. I loves the Bacon!)"Friday the 13th" gets a middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10 from me. It's worth seeing because of its important part in the history of the overall franchise. But it's one of the weaker entries and lacks the style and entertainment seen in later films.

'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all of. Is 'Friday the 13th' an original film in terms of overall story? No, having been, and still is, compared to 'Halloween' (released two years earlier). One can see why somewhat, it is derivative in a way but to me it didn't come over as a direct rip off. 'Friday the 13th' is far from the best when it comes to acting, excepting Betsy Palmer (very good) and Adrienne King (charming). The others are average at best, though it was interesting to see Kevin Bacon in an early role pre-stardom.Nor is it the best when it comes to dialogue. Much of it is very crude and cheesy. Or character development, while the characters are actually still easy to sympathise with to some extent they are stereotypes that we don't know an awful lot about generally. However, while it may not be a "great" film, 'Friday the 13th' is great guilty pleasure fun and it is very easy to understand its popularity and influence. It's very gory and gruesome, though not pointlessly so, but it is also very frightening and suspenseful. This is apparent in the deaths, which couldn't have been more creative or shocking, and the hauntingly eerie music score. 'Friday the 13th' is assuredly directed and moves along at a lively pace. The late reveal is for the better and works very well. The climax is a long way from a petering out one, instead the film goes out on a very strong bang, right up to the unexpected and freaky final jolt clearly inspired by 'Carrie'. Overall, good fun and very scary even if not exactly classified as great. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Personally this one isn't my favorite slasher film, My Bloody Valentine from 1981 is. But Friday the 13th has its moments.Camp Crystal Lake has a killer out there... who could it be? No one knows, and there are some teens going there to reopen the campground for children joining up for the summer. The old coot at the local store warns otherwise but no one listens. When the truth is discovered, along with the tragic story of a drowned little boy, one girl is left fighting for her life.Friday the 13th has average scenery, mainly rural homes and trees. The acting is decent and I love the soundtrack. It isn't all that original and it had a number of other movies stealing the camp killer idea (the Burning and Sleepaway Camp), but still, Friday the 13th manages to be entertaining all the way through. I don't really understand the need for its many sequels, but it did very well as a cult film over the years and has remained a favorite within the slasher genre for years.

In 1980, two years after "Halloween" scared the hell out of everybody, "Friday the 13th" was released to theaters. This was a clever knockoff of the John Carpenter horror classic, only this one was more violent and gruesome. That aspect turned critics off big time. But moviegoers couldn't resist. They flocked to see this movie and made it a big hit. I never saw this film on the big screen because I was only 9 years old when it came out. After I saw it on cable a few years later, it scared the hell out of me! It doesn't scare me that much today, but it's a far more effective horror/thriller than the last five movies in the series (parts 5 through 9). They should have stopped making these "Friday the 13th" movies after the fourth film, which was subtitled "The Final Chapter". And you know what's even scarier, they're making part 10. "Friday the 13th" was the beginning of the sick slasher genre that played out during the early 1980s. The first films in both the "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" series' were easily the best. "Halloween" was a great horror film. "Friday the 13th" isn't up there with "Halloween", but it's a well-crafted gorefest.*** (out of four)

Friday the 13th must be one of the biggest mysteries in cinema. Although it's a long way from being a good movie, its success and influence is unnameable ( and even unbelievable ). Don't get me wrong...I'm not at all saying that Friday the 13th is a terrible film or not even worth a watch but - let's face it - the plot idea is pretty dumb, the acting and directing are far below average and they haven't fully used the options of setting and location they had. The make-up effects ( by the master Tom Savini himself ) are excellent, but that alone isn't really enough to create a legendary horror movie in my opinion. Some of the later sequels ( Episode 6 : Jason Lives is the perfect example ) and even a few of the numberless rip-offs are superior to the production.
I suppose the story is pretty much known by everyone know and I even think the identity of the "mysterious killer" of this episode isn't that much of a mystery anymore. Anyway, in case you don't know it, I won't spoil the fun so see for yourself. Although my thoughts on it aren't that high, I do think it's must-see stuff for horror fans. Without any shame, I even admit that Friday the 13th and ALL its sequels are a guilty pleasure of mine. I'll never reckon them as good - or even decent - efforts in the genre, but I'm always up for a little bit of brainless gore slashing. And that's what these series are made for...pure entertainment !! So, in a way, they succeeded after all. They never try to give a thoughtful message to the viewer or something. There are just dumb-looking teenagers being slaughtered...the more the merrier.Favorite "rewind"-scene : A young and horny Kevin Bacon being brutally killed in one of his first memorable roles.

The sub-genre of horror, often hit or miss, has divided horror movie lovers ever since it became mainstream in 1970s. Personally, slashers can be really good if they're done right, with a good story, scares, nice atmosphere, and memorable scenes. This one has it all, and that's why it is so popular even today.Along with other influential slasher classics of the 1970s, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and Black Christmas, they created iconic horror villains many TV shows and films try to copy or spoof.I've watched this one a couple of times, when I was a kid, teenager, young adult, all with different people, and it never gets old or boring. The atmosphere of summer camp in the late 1970s is perfect and nostalgic. Music to create tension is great. Acting is okay, with majority of actors being surprisingly good, if you consider time it was released.Friday the 13th franchise is perfect fun for summer nights, or to watch through month of Halloween!

In a full moon night of a Friday, 13th, the instructors of Camp Crystal Lake are murdered, one by one, in a night of terror. In the end of the story, a convincing explanation clarifies what have happened. This cult movie was very original and spooky in 1980. Placed basically in one location and with unknown young actors and actresses, it was indeed a successful low budget movie, copied many times in other films. Today I have just watched it again, now on a recently released DVD, and it is still good to see. I regret the sequels, since the story is very well resolved in a credible way without supernatural. This way, it is much more terrifying and could have stopped right here. My vote is seven.

Friday the 13th is one of those movies that should appear at the drive-in and never go any farther. It's the kind of movie people go to see just to get their girlfriend scared and make out with her later. And now it's on video. What a coincidence. In short, it's not scary; we never see the killer until the end of the movie, and until then it's weapons in the corner of the screen, or a first-person view.         The plot of the movie is better constructed than what I expected from a slasher, and that's a good thing, considering that it's sequels are just Jason running around slaughtering people for no reason, excpet that they're between the ages of 17 and 25. The movie begins with two camp councillors being killed by an unknown stalker at Camp Chrystal Lake in 1957. Fast forward to 1980, where a group of teens plan on re-opening the camp. Of course, someone is there watching them, but we don't know who. A bunch of people get killed, and the killer is finally revealed in the end, and the worst chase ever ensues. (I'm afraid I'm not going to spoil the rest for you, because it's a surprise, but a surprise you shouldn't bother finding out for yourself.) Aside from a good plot, Friday the 13th has nothing, not even Jason (That's right, big-bad Jason doesn't make his debut until Part Two). It's a movie that a lot of people see and that a lot of people liked, but maybe some day, we'll all come to our senses.

Friday the 13th. The movie which turned around the horror genre and gave us one of the most unforgettable villains and endings, is, and always will be a horror classic. Friday the 13th doesn't set out to be glossy and glamorous. Friday the 13th sets out to do what it wants to do; and that is, make you sit on the edge of your seat, feel uncomfortable and unnerved, to make you frightened when you go to bed after watching it. Friday the 13th delivers all of the fantastic horror goods. The plot revolves around American teenagers, who are the new counsellors at the apparently jinxed Camp Crystal Lake. These naive, horny youngsters have a one-track mind and break all of the innocent borders which has more depth than you would think. Basically, the message is "Don't have pre-marital sex, or you'll die" just like many of Friday the 13th's predecessors and clones send out as well. Friday the 13th has a variety of characters, all who you could possibly relate to. These characters are then slowly followed and hacked off one by one, in dark, gory, claustrophobic manners, which may leave you frightened in the same way Psycho made showers scary. As the camp counsellors are knocked off one by one, the tension rises higher and higher. Along the journey of carnage, the hugely effective soundtrack really creeps under your skin, highlighting how jumpy and scary the events happening on screen really are. For example when a chase scene occurs, the music may speed up, the tempo rising and jittering, almost moving like the characters on screen are. The acting in Friday the 13th is not bad at all; some of the actors/actresses may be a little amateur, but there is nothing terrible in this picture. The settings are also very effective. The stalkings and slaying in broad daylight and open spaces are a twist in a new direction, showing that not everything has to happen in the dark, in a small isolated house on the top of a hill, so the variation of location makes forests, cabins and even lakes more unappealing to the viewers afterwards, and may leave them creeped out by the aforementioned places. The camera-work is also very effective. The way the camera 'stalks' the victim behind trees and bushes, and the way the camera chases after it's victims as the point of view of the villain is unique and exciting, and adds a more tense and faster chill to the movie. Friday the 13th may play as a clich√©d slasher, a story of sex equalling carnage, but it plays so effectively well it is a too important horror movie to simply be dismissed. It collects everything appealing about the 80's horror genre and wraps it up neatly into this fantastic horror package. A classic in it's genre.

This film is not the best movie of all time, but it's still good. I found that some parts we slept a little, but it comes just 3 or 4 minutes of bored, the rest is quite significant and also almost scary (but do not go too far either). This is not the film that makes the most fear in the world, but I have to admit that some parts were the heart beating fast enough. The murderer of the first part is quite disappointing when compared with the murderer of following components of the franchise. I find it is not as though his Halloween rival, but each his own.Good movie !!!

Director had real snake killed for filming. Didn't tell owner what was going to happen to it. Disgusting.

Friday the 13th is a classic masterpiece, it uses a clever sort of storytelling to hide the identity of the killer as well as who the main character is to the end. For a slasher movie, it's not as bloody as a modern slasher, but it still delivers brutal kills. The music and sound effects are all great. The suspense-building is great as you can kinda figure out when someone's is going to get murdered. And without spoiling anything, the acting of the killer is truly terrifying! Some acting is kind of cheesy but that doesn't change mutch. It has a great atmosphere and after rewatching it, Friday the 13th from 1980 is now one of my favourite horror movies of all time! Overall it's a must see movie with a score of 9/10 from me!

A group of camp counselors, a young Kevin Bacon among them, are busy trying to re-open Camp Crystal Lake years after multiple murders shut it down, despite the ravings of Crazy Ralph. They are dispatched one by one by an unseen killer. This IS a classic and always will be. Don't get me wrong as it's not perfect. But it's far from "merely a Halloween" clone which some people say. The original Halloween is a perfect classic, but let this film stand on it's own legs as it has every right to. Although I'm saddened about how shoddily Paramount seemed to put out their recent box set. Hell when New Line acquired the rights to the series, yes their Jason films suck, but at least they do right by the fans DVD-wise.Paramount could have done a great service to us by looking back at New Lin's Nightmare on Elm Street box set. It's a shame they didn't.My Grade: A- Eye Candy: Jeannine Taylor shows ta-tas and ass cleavage

Friday the 13th may not have been the first movie of its kind and the kill scenes may have been copied from other movies, but there's no denying the importance of the film. Friday the 13th is the film I see as most responsible for the slasher boom of the 80s. It and its sequels proved that horror fans were willing to pay money to see practically the same movie (with slight modifications) over and over. As I look back at it now, it seems a bit silly to me, but I was one of those who willing plopped down my money every few years for a chance to see another Friday the 13th movie.I don't see any point in going through the plot. Most horror fans know it by heart. Instead, I'll cover a few of the things I like about the movie. First, the kill scenes. Tom Savini's special effects are great. I especially like the scene where Kevin Bacon is speared from under the bed. Second, regardless of the number of times I've seen it, the film does have an atmosphere of fear about it. The repetitive music, the unseen killer, and the bodies dropping at every turn have always given me chills. Third, I enjoy the final showdown between the killer and the "final girl". I've always thought the final fight scene was a highlight of the film. Finally, and this is a personal thing, but Friday the 13th was the first movie of its type I ever saw. I hadn't seen movies like Halloween or Black Christmas when I first saw this one. Therefore, it holds a special place with me.Unfortunately, even though I'm a fan, I see problems. The biggest is the predictability of the plot. Even though Friday the 13th was made early in the slasher cycle, how hard was it to predict the outcome? Also, the characters in the movie are incredibly stupid. A lot of the murders could have been prevented if anyone at any point in the movie had demonstrated any brain power. But then it wouldn't have been so much fun.It may not be the kind of movie the more "sophisticated" horror fan admits to enjoying, but I'm not above admitting that Friday the 13th remains a favorite of mine. It's fun stuff!

It feels almost redundant to post a review of a movie as iconic as this one, but here goes. I assume 99% of people reading this have seen it already, but if not, watch out for spoilers, yo.Friday the 13th (which was almost titled Long Night at Camp Blood) may not have been anyone's pet project ‚Äî the director, Sean S. Cunningham, admitted that it was an attempt to ride off the success of John Carpenter's Halloween, which was released two years prior, and the writer, Victor Miller, wrote the script in two weeks ‚Äî but it's a cult classic for a reason. It didn't do that well when it was first released ‚Äî it made about $39 million at box office but received many negative reviews, including a particularly scathing commentary from Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert (who didn't even bother to hide the ending from readers). And, technically speaking, it's not that amazing of a movie ‚Äî some forgettable characters, mostly weak dialogue. But it continues to gain popularity even to this day.It's really a classic slasher flick. A bunch of young counselors have arrived at camp early to help set up and are murdered one by one by a mysterious killer. It's got the short shorts, the stormy night, and the obligatory sex scene (with Kevin Bacon and the stunning Jeannine Taylor, no less). But you really do feel the tension mounting as the movie progresses, partially due to the use of music by Harry Manfredini.As soon as Annie ‚Äî innocent, freckled little Annie ‚Äî gets her throat slit in the woods, I was immediately reminded of how surprisingly good the murder scenes are. They aren't over the top gory and aren't drawn out too long ‚Äî it's just a quick, efficient kill and then on to the anticipation of the next one.I liked that we never saw a hint of the killer beyond maybe their feet, or a hand on a shower curtain ‚Äî it's really effective in adding to the already tense mood, not to mention, of course, hiding the surprise reveal until the very end. Speaking of which, I really enjoyed the twist ‚Äî again, SPOILER ALERT, but y'all know this already. Having the killer be Mrs. Voorhees was just¬Ö awesome. Exacting revenge on behalf of her son, neglected by camp counselors while he drowned in the lake¬Ö brilliant. And her talking with herself ‚Äî or talking "with Jason" ‚Äî was creepily well done. It may not be my favorite classic horror movie ‚Äî of the trio (Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street), I'm wayyyy more of a Freddy girl.

as a fan of horror movies I must say that "Friday The 13th" is overrated. It's so absurd,boring,not frightening or interesting in any way. The acting is bad,very bad,the plot is stupid and the murders so predictable and lame that I almost laugh instead scare.It begins very nice but its get boring after a few minutes .I thought that this one will be a huge movie because it is so popular In the genre of horror movies, but I was really disappointed. I'll give you advice: STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!,if you want REAL horror movie you must watch THE EXORCIST. it's much better than this crap. Or if you want a slasher movie you can try "A Nightmare On Elm Street" or "Halloween".

Friday THE 13TH (1980)directed by: Sean S. Cunninghamstarring: Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Jeannine Taylor, and Kevin Baconplot: Seven camp councilors head to Camp Crystal Lake to fix it up for the summer. Despite warnings of a dark past and a 'death curse', the teens decide to have a good time anyway, and at night indulge in sex, drugs, and strip poker. Unfortunately for them, a psycho killer is prowling the camp grounds, picking them off one by one. When only one is left, she must discover the identity of the killer and fight for her life.my thoughts: Ever since I can remember, I've loved this film. When I was a child, it scared the crap out of me. That chilling noise playing in the stalk sequences (which has now become the most famous sound in horror films) haunted my nightmares, and some of the gore scenes were really graphic.Viewing it now, it is no longer that scary but it is still a lot of fun. I liked how these earlier Friday films ignored the stereotypical teenage characters. There's no slut, no jock, no token anything. Every character felt really natural and for some of them, I cared when they died.The gore scenes are great, thanks to Tom Savini. We get stabbings, decapitations, and plenty more. Gore hounds will love this. Well since every gore hound has seen this, gore hounds mostly already love this.And then there's the two key things in making a good horror film. The directing and the music. Sean S. Cunningham is a really good director and establishes the camp setting perfectly. He adds beautiful shots of the wind blowing against the trees, the lake at sunrise, that you wouldn't find in later entries.The music is also great. Harry Manfredini is one of my favorite composers, because he makes the chase scenes so much more exciting. The music in the final scene also works like a charm.I forgot to mention that this film has one of the most popular and remembered horror endings of all time. And while it may have stolen from CARRIE, it works just as well here and is the cherry on top of a classic slasher film.

Not exactly a masterpiece, but not a waste of time either.  This film is basically a starters set for the film-buffs who start watching horror films. Premise- a killer is after a bunch of kids at a camp many years after a tragedy to a kid named Jason Voorhees.  Some good killer scenes (and Betsy Palmer is very good in this film) but not exactly a great horror film. Classic entertainment anyway.  A-

This legendary classic 1980 slasher flick is the one that started the famous Jason Voorhees franchise. Starred Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King, this movie gives offers up plenty of gore, horny teens, and a deranged mother seeking revenge. The acting was less than satisfactory, it wasn't terrible, it's just that some of it was really cheesy at times. I did think that it took a little too long getting going, the best part was the last 40 minutes. That was when the screaming and offscreen killings and action happened. Some of the fighting and action was cheesy and kinda funny, it wasn't supposed to be though, so that's not good. At 1 point an axe rises behind a girl, and she has she the most laughable cheesy scream I've ever seen or heard, I was kinda annoyed by that, I just thought the actors could've done a lot better than that. I did enjoy Betsy Palmer's performance though. I did like that the killings occurred offscreen, so I didn't have to suffer through what most modern day horror movies do, meaning the constant full detail graphic horror violence. I like it when movies leave something to the imagination. I didn't mind seeing the somewhat bloody aftermath of the victim's bodies. So overall, just an OK horror film, enjoyed parts, and laughed at others 5/10.

Just my opinion, but this would end up being a typical slasher film if not for the absolutely unforgettable performance of Betsey Palmer. She is incredible, unhinged, cannot take my eyes off her when she is on screen, No spoilers! See it just to see a real acting legend nail it.

Friday the 13th may have terrible dialog, mediocre actors, and a story line that has been mimicked time and time again, but it has one thing going for it: it is so damn entertaining. Anyone who's familiar with the character of Jason Vorhees but not the specifics is in for a surprise for this one. Although the whole bunch of characters are pretty one dimensional, there are some scenes that are pretty stand out. One particularly stands out, because it is the first "modern" encounter with the killer. The innocent, naive teenage girl getting a ride to the oh-so famous Camp Crystal Lake. I found it particularly terrifying when I first saw it because it's a large amount of terror- during the daytime. Many movies always stick to night time horror, but Friday the 13th is terrifying whenever it wants. It's also particularly funny to see a young Kevin Bacon. Yes, we may have seen and heard the movies/stories of camp counselors getting knocked off, but Friday the 13th made a name for itself. I must give a generous amount of props to that music and other noises, and it deservingly is cemented in pop culture(cheecheecheeahhahhahh.) This is a very entertaining movie, and although it may not be Grade A, it sure as hell can be as entertaining as one(at the worst a Grade C.)

Friday the 13th is a notorious slasher horror very much from the word go hence the multiple sequels over the years. Its also notable for an early appearance by Kevin Bacon who plays one of the camp counsellors.The film is set in Camp Crystal where a group of horny teenagers also known as camp counsellors are getting ready to refurbish Camp Crystal Lake some years after it was shut down when some people were killed.The town loon, Crazy Ralph warns the kids to get out but we see them being killed off in a gory manner by an unseen killer.What these kids have not been told that in the late 1950s a young boy named Jason drowned in the lake because the camp counsellors were too busy having sex to notice he needed help.The film has gory effects from Paul Savini. If you have seen previous films where he has been involved then there is nothing new in those throats being slashed scenes. As for the rest of the film you have kids being horny, playing strip monopoly over the course of the night but like the far superior film Halloween they are being stalked and murdered.Not all of the film takes place at night, there is an eerie scene when one person hitches a lift in a van but you kind of felt that would also had given the murderer away.I felt that for some portions of the film it was rather dull and boring. Kind of thought that some scenes were purely filler to pad out the running time.There was also a lot of stupidity by our heroine after the killer is revealed such as the killer being knocked out and our heroine decides to stop and rest for a bit!Its regarded as a low budget classic but it lacked a lot of tension and thrills but it does deliver in gore even though its now dated and even looks tame today.
