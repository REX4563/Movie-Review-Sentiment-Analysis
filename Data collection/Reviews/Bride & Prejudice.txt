OK, if you don't like people breaking into song unexpectedly, don't go see this movie - let me just say that upfront!I went to see this re-work of my favourite novel and thought it would be atrocious and envisaged walking out of the theatre in disgust in advance. What I got was an explosion of colour and music, Bollywood style, and sure some of the songs were pretty awful, but hey, there were a few terrible numbers in Grease too, and I still love that movie!The lead players were all virtually unknown to me but they were perfect in their roles. The role of Lalita (the Elizabeth role in the original book) was perfectly cast - she was beautiful and she really held the whole movie together. And Martin Henderson was perfect as the American version of the disdainful Mr Darcy, this time Mr Will Darcy.Go and see this film if you are open to something new - it really is quite a faithful re-work of the story, and it is very entertaining.The only people who won't enjoy this are people who hate musicals with a passion, or people who are purists to the original.If you liked Chicago, then you can definitely enjoy this one too. (That also had some dodgy old songs, but the story carried you past those parts!)Bring on the Bollywood!

A really fun and entertaining movie which doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. Possible SPOILERS ahead for those who haven't read the classic novel or watched the BBC Mini-series.P&P is my all time favourite book and I am a huge fan of the BBC series - Colin Firth was a perfect Darcy and Jennifer Ehle an equally perfect Elizabeth. My main gripes were the costumes (could have been better) and the fact that Darcy begins to fall for Elizabeth (in spite of himself) much earlier in the book than the BBC portrayed. Bride & P does a much better job of these points. The outfits are great as is the fact that Wil (Darcy) fancies Lalitha almost from the beginning. The downside of this version is that it was a little rushed. They could have added on 15/20 mins to fill out the storyline and dialogue, and Darcy is not nearly as proud.The upside is that Bingley is not annoyingly cheerful, he is on the same level as Darcy and a bit of a dish actually. Similarly, Mr. Kholi (or Collins) is a bit sad and irritating rather than nasty. He is the star of this film who absolutely steals EVERY scene he is in. I do think there was chemistry between Ash and Martin and enjoyed their scenes in LA. A longer script would have given Mr. Bakshi more lines of wit, as would have more depth to the character of Darcy, Lalitha, Jaya and Balraj. Also, Wickham's dealings with Darcy's sister could have been a bit more believable with more than just one line.Henderson is not Firth but he was great as Darcy and has those eyes... Ash was beautiful as always - she wasn't Miss World for nothing and her acting will get better with more experience.Despite what seem like many criticisms, this film had a warm, fun feel-good factor that it was supposed to have. Bollywood song and dance routines aside, the lyrics were a bit cheesy but then so are most Rodgers and Hammerstein classics that I grew up watching - but that doesn't make the songs any less fun or catchy. Songs in musicals are rarely meant to change your life - think Grease, the Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, but we still sing along happily to 'raindrops and roses and brown paper bags ...' which if transplanted to a modern movie would be cheesy and corny, but they have the benefit of being called classics from a different era. Well this is a different genre and it works splendidly for me. 'My lips are waiting my hips are shaking, take me to love...' 'No life without wife, oh yeah yeah yeah...' The BBC version was great but filled with 5 hours of solid dialogue, as an Austen fan, I welcome this new perspective on the novel. There is no better way to enjoy such a classic work than to share different takes on it, it makes you appreciate the book even more - I'm off to read it again.

Went to see that movie twice and it only came out on the 22nd December in France!!! Full of color and great music!! If u want to spend a really nice time in cinema and laughing your head off over Mr Kholi, go at once.... And if u wanna check out nice a nice guy , go at least for Mr Will Darcy!! All jokes aside, Ash's first "american" movie is a success. They are all acting greatly and makes us want to go and visit Amritsar!! A big surprise also for hip-hop lovers: Ashanti's appearance for "Payal Bajake"'s song. The landscapes are wonderful. East really meets West.. and it's an enjoyable mix or how to teach a Westerner that he doesn't have it all...And as in all of Chandha movie's, the end is a delight!! ENJOY!!

Well, it's pretty hard, isn't it, to write a spoiler for a film which is based on such a well-known, well-loved novel! I will show my hand here and say that I am a Janeite. However, I am not a purist and I like many Jane Austen adaptations that many Janeites don't (for example I like 'Mansfield Park'). I enjoyed 'Bride and prejudice' for its colour and fun. The attempt to update 'P&P' to a contemporary Indian setting worked well most of the time, with the translation to India being effective because it is a society where arranged marriages are still an accepted way to go. The script did a pretty good job of capturing the essence of the story whilst playing around with some of the details eg cutting out the fifth daughter whose role in the story is pretty minimal, and making the 'tyrant' in Darcy's life his mother not his aunt (a more realistic situation in its modern setting). I loved the 'no life without a wife' song and dance routine though it reminded me at times of the 'Matchmaker' song in 'Fiddler on the roof'. However, the film suffered a little, for a number of reasons, the main ones being that it left the Bollywood- style when it went to Hollywood (which changed the tone of the film), it didn't really find a good way to make Wickham as wicked as he is in the original, and there did not seem to be the same desperate need to be married as there was for the Bennet sisters in 'P&P'. These modern Indian women had jobs and could, it appeared, be independent without having husbands, removing the urgency that drives its 'P&P' original. Despite this, though, it does manage to incorporate some of the satire against pomposity and the arrogance of the moneyed class that makes 'P&P' more than a simple romance. Overall, then, I found it a fun film and an entertaining take on my favourite novel.

Someone said that Darcy wasn't good looking enough. Are you crazy? He is amazing in this movie, I just saw it and yeah the songs are terrible and I was looking for the fast forward button in the theater but you cant say that the rest of the movie wasn't charming. It was so bollywood I loved it. The no kissing, the whole misunderstanding between girl and boy. It was an entertainer. I think that was the point. Not to win an Oscar or to do great things but to entertain and I think it succeeded in that mission. I think we should stop analyzing every small detail of the movie and just learn to enjoy it. Who didn't laugh when they saw Ashanti. There are humorous parts in the movie that we just have to take and leave the horrible songs behind. For a first run of a mixture between bollywood and Hollywood. I cant say it was too bad.

A Bollywood-style version of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice, Bride & Prejudice tells the story of the Bakshi family, living in a small Indian town with four daughters whom their mother is anxious to marry off. The family knows a few very eligible bachelors (read "rich, successful in business and handsome") from the UK and the US, and the film tells the troubles, triumphs and tragedies surrounding the daughters' relationships with the bachelors.First, I should note that I'm not a huge fan of Bollywood musicals, soap opera-like plots, realist dramas or traditional romance films (traditional both in a filmic sense and in the sense of traditionalist values being espoused). So my rating might reflect that bias. On the other hand, there are films in all of those genres that I do like quite a bit, and my wife, who is Indian and usually enjoys those genres much more than I do, gave Bride & Prejudice an 8, so perhaps my bias wasn't that significant.A 7 from me is equivalent to a "C" letter grade--a passing grade but nothing to be overly proud of. For me, it means the film is average, with as many things done wrong as right. Let's look at the problems I had with Bride & Prejudice first.Director Gurinder Chadha--whose Bend It Like Beckham (2002) I liked a lot--made Bride & Prejudice a bit too sprawling, both in tone and plot. The tone ranges from serious romance to tragedy to parody, but those attitudes are all approached very differently from one another and thus do not mix very well in the film. They instead take turns in a way that will likely result in many viewers preferring one approach over the other and lamenting having to wait for that kind of material to appear again. For example, the parody material worked much better for me, and after awhile, I found myself occasionally growing impatient for it to reappear.The plot, and this may be due to a close parallel with the Austen book, tends to drone on and on, one episode after another, without a clear climax until the very end. The film really could have stopped at any arbitrary point and been satisfactory (except perhaps to those only accepting of a traditional "happy" ending). Once the "riding off into the sunset" climax finally does arrive, it feels more like it took 3 or 4 hours to get there rather than the film's actual running time of just under 2 hours.However, there are a number of positive aspects to note. As I briefly noted above, the more humorous material worked very well for me, and much of the film is humorous. Chadha even made a nice attempt to inject parody into some musical numbers. The number set in the marketplace, with singing vendors and transvestites, and the number set in Los Angeles were particularly funny. There is a very funny scene with one of the Bakshi sisters doing a "snake dance". Even better, all of the material with and about Mr. Kholi (Nitin Chandra Ganatra) was hilarious.The performances are mostly good, although Martin Henderson as Will Darcy remains oddly aloof even when we're supposed to warm up to him. Also, because the film is so sprawling, a few good characters, such as Balraj (Naveen Andrews) and Kiran Bingley (Indira Varma), are mostly lost in the shuffle.The romance and realist drama material occasionally worked for me, and might have worked even better if I hadn't liked the comedy portions so much that I was wishing for their return instead. Overall, Bride & Prejudice is worth seeing, but unless you're a big fan of the genres and don't mind switching gears continually, lower your expectations a bit before watching.

This is a seriously bad movie that I've been unlucky enough to watch.Cons: Bad characterization - both Aishwarya and Martin jump into their pride and prejudice polarities in no time at all - it's as if the director is expecting the audience to know the characters well already.Terrible song-and-dance routines - I don't know if the attempt was to make it a musical, but the routines look terribly shoddy. They neither match Hollywood musical standards, neither are they good Bollywood-type interludes.Poor Acting - Aishwarya overacts and Martin underacts.Terrible view of India - The way Indian arranged marriage and family systems are shown, I'm really surprised how the Indian cast agreed to act in such a movie.

Some of my friends warned me about it. My sister in law in India said it's a bore....flop. Curiosity kills the cat so I had to rent it. Well she was wrong. It is not just a bore, it is torturous 2 hours of agony. I must admit I had better expectations from Chaddha. Oh well, live and learn. It is a total showdown of mental bankruptcy. Total incompetency. It is not funny, it is not mystery, it is a bad musical at the best. The songs are sung in English that not even Indians can understand. It does not offer any educational value. And I got the feeling the director has gone out of her way to make Indians look greedy, self centered and unrefined.I have been away from India too long and I am not sensitive but this movie gave me creeps.

Vibrant, colorful, hilarious and lively, this movie was a sheer joy to watch. A refreshing take on an old classic. But be warned, this movie will not appeal to everybody - especially those who don't go to watch it with an open mind. Aishwarya Rai looks the best she ever has and turns in a confident performance in her first English speaking role - not always an easy transition. Martin Henderson is handsome and charming and the supporting cast too. But Nitin Ganatra as the comic bride seeking American is the show stealer in his over the top performance as Mr.Kohli. Gurinder Chadha has attempted what few would dare to take on and she's pulled it off. It's a comic tale of love and romance. Thoroughly enjoyable!

I am a big Jane Austen fan, and love "Pride and Prejudice." I have seen many versions of it and always enjoy a new twist on the story. I love Bollywood musicals. They are so colorful and full of life and I enjoy listening to the music. A caveat must be spoken here...these are definitely not for everyone. A lot of Americans today think that musicals are hokey; most musicals that are successful in the US are gritty (ex: Chicago, Moulin Rouge, et al). Thiswas definitely more like the Lerner and Loewe or Rodgers andHammerstein musicals of the 40s and 50s. The author of the screenplay did a great job updating the story for today's world. In Austen's time, a young lady could be "ruined" simply by spending the night with a man, regardless of the circumstances, and of course that doesn't play in today's world. I thought the updating was believable and made sense. The musical numbers were brilliantly done and a lot of fun to watch! I know that not everyone will enjoy this, but it was definitely my cup of tea! More, please! Note that if you see this, make sure you don't jump up and leave right away at the end...there is a funny joke regarding the lack of kissing in the movie during the credits...

I wonder if at any time during the making of this movie writer and director Gurinder Chadha realized her film was going haywire.Actually, a Bollywoodized version of Jane Austen's novel, "Pride and Prejudice," sounds an interesting, enticing premise. But Chadha, who quite successfully turned a conventional coming-of-age, romantic comedy into the enjoyable "Bend it Like Beckham" (2003), fails miserably this time.She seems to have an able and willing cast in "Bride and Prejudice," but they just don't click.The film's two biggest problems: Chadha's insistence on including English-language songs mixed in with a few Hindi Bollywood numbers, and lead actor Martin Henderson as Darcy.The Hindi songs are bouncy, vivacious, fun to watch. They're well choreographed and fit rather nicely into the story. The same cannot be said of the English songs. I've no idea why Chadha decided to add those in this film. They're clunky, awkward and riddled with laughable lyrics. I realize they're not meant to be taken seriously, but they prove to be tremendously distracting and bog down the story.The lyrics? Well, that's just rotten writing there. In one song, Lalitha (Aishwarya Rai) sings, "I want a man who'll give some back/Who'll talk to me and not to my rack." Then there's American actor Henderson. A truly horrid casting choice. Henderson lacks charm, screen presence, creates absolutely no chemistry with Rai. He turns Darcy into an utterly vapid, a complete dullard with no personality.Rai's Lalitha  the Elizabeth Bennet character  comes across as a strikingly smart, clever, intelligent and self-assured woman. That she would find Henderson's Darcy even remotely attractive asks us to suspend our disbelief a bit too much. The Lalitha-Darcy relationship is tough to swallow.In Chadha's defense, it's nice to see Indians speak perfect English. Rai speaks flawlessly and Chadha and co-writer Paul Mayeda Berges don't turn her into a stereotype. I've no idea if Rai is the most beautiful woman on the planet. But I bet she comes darn close.And Rai gives Lalitha a valiant try. But she's saddled with awful dialogue and given poor direction. Also, when a film suddenly stops to turn into a music video, it's hard to get any momentum going. What exactly is the need for the Ashanti performance? Speaking of poor direction and stereotypes, Chadha lets the film come apart completely with the introduction of Mr. Kholi (the film's version of Austen's Mr. Collins), an Indian-born suitor who wants to Lalitha back to his spread in Los Angeles. Nitin Ganatra plays the character so broadly that the caricature gets tiresome within the first few minutes. But we're forced to endure him for too many scenes. It's abundantly clear Chadha deluded herself into thinking this type of over-the-top acting would elicit laughs. Instead, all it does is make you cringe.If screenwriters pen some good roles for her, Rai has a great future ahead of her in English-language movies. She should be more discerning about what roles she picks. Chadha's film falls apart within the first 20 minutes or so and then does nothing to fix itself. It just keeps going from bad to worse and, eventually, turns downright embarrassing.Too bad. This one had potential.

I recently rented this movie and enjoyed it so much that I bought the DVD the next day and have already watched it three times. While I thought the ending was abit abrupt and Lalita fell inlove with Darcy too quickly, I loved this movie. It wasn't overtaxing or edge of your seat or made your mind work, but, it was an entertaining, lovely, cute, colourful and cheerful movie that entertained me and left me smiling which is what movies are supposed to do.While the songs took abit of getting used to the first time, it didn't really bother me the other times and actually enhanced the film.Darcy and Lalita had such great chemistry, Martin Henderson was gorgeous and suitably intense and brooding for the part - although the Darcy character was slightly too nice all the way through the film - the songs were lively and such bright colours and it was so funny. I loved the song No Life Without Wife and the scene afterwards where Darcy grabs Lalita in the rain is so intense.All in all it won't make you jump or make your mind work, but, it will keep you smiling and entertained for a few hours

In Bride and Prejudice  Gurinder Chadha's Bollywood film version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice  a few things are different. There are four daughters instead of five. Only two of these daughters are married by the end of the film, as opposed to the novel where three of them are married to eligible suitors. Will Darcy, played aptly by Martin Henderson, does not exude as much pride as is expected out of his character, while Lalita Bakshi (the film equivalent to Elizabeth Bennet played by Aishwarya Rai) has many judgments to make against other characters where Darcy's pride (or lack thereof) just does not measure up to the full force of her character.Other differences between the novel and the film added and took away from the film. The changes into modern day went flawlessly into the film. Examples of these seamlessly modern day changes included the use of e-mail instead of letters, and going between cities (and countries) rather than large estates in the countryside of England. The supporting cast, integral to the story of Pride and Prejudice, hold up Bride and Prejudice very well. They keep the film moving and insert funny moments as well.Bride and Prejudice becomes slightly confusing after the first third of the film is over when events from the novel become mixed up with additions to the film, as well as when events from the novel end up in a different order on screen than they did on the page. Overall, Bride and Prejudice was a high quality movie-going experience. With a good supporting cast, as well as reasonable performances out of the leading actors, this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel was very enjoyable.

Gurinda (Bend It Like Beckham) Chadha's exuberant Bollywood/chick-lit crossover is so unashamedly feelgood that viewing it is akin to being in a slow motion tornado as it rolls through the world's most colourful flowershop.Relocating Jane Austen's novel of match-making and heartache to a small rural town in India rescues it from being forevermore a period piece by finding a context in which its arranged unions and propriety are still relevant.But, really, any old romantic tale would have worked as well, given that Chadha's mission is to ply the senses with a vibrant kaleidoscopic whirl of colour, dancing and music.And beautiful people, too. India's never looked so ravishing, with nary a pauper in sight as whole streets burst into spontaneous song and dance.But even surrounded by so many fetching profiles, former Miss World Aishwarya Rai rather takes the breath away. It's almost a shame, because her stunning looks almost overshadow the genuinely relaxed charm she exudes as her fiery character Lalita plays loves-me-love-me-not with Martin Henderson's occasionally stuffy and cool-blooded businessman Darcy.Look for anything like social reality and satire in Bride And Prejudice and you'll wind up disappointed but let yourself fall into it with your eyes and ears wide open and there's a good chance it'll run off with your heart  for a couple of hours, at least.

OK Bollywood-style rendering of the famous drama. The cheesy feel of many scenes is a logical result of the forced blending of the (assumed) politically correct feel-good dogma of Hollywood and easy-going sugar sweet Bollywood fashion. There are some pretty funny (though predictable) scenes and the story is told in a fast pace, without too many endless songs. The way the makers adapted the original story of Pride & Prejudice is applaudable: accurate but with enough freedom to create a product of its own. We get a good view of the trappings of cultural prejudices in an original but sometimes corny manner. It remains a fact that the Mr. Darcy of the '90's British version of P & P is never to be surpassed...

I had heard that this movie is not as good as Bend It Like Bekham. But I got the VCD of the Hindi dubbed version titled Balle Balle Amritsar to LA. (All my comments are in relation only to the version I watched.)The title cracked me up some weeks ago. I saw a trailer with Aishwarya Rai dancing with a white guy with water springs shooting up in sky in the background and the white guy sang in Hindi.The first thing wrong with the film is the title. Throughout the movie I could feel the attitude of the maker - trivialising film making. Beckham was funny, but in this one Gurinder Chadha tries to extract humour out of trivialising the art of film making, trivialising her characters and thereby the whole movie. There is hardly a good funny moment in the movie.Just imagine going to a restaurant and ordering every dish they have putting it in a big bucket, mixing it up and hoping that it would taste good. Gurinder tried that. It tastes awful.The characters are poorly sketched. There is no concept of relationship building. The second sentence that people say to each other sounds like they know each other since years. Dialogues have been written with no seriousness or thought. There is too much happening at an unrealistic pace. Somehow the flow and direction of narration lacks credibility. Everything in the movie is fake. The director has made no effort to understand the real people and has gone on her own ride using people for granted. Her understanding of Indians and Westerners - both - is out of the real. There is extreme polarisation. There is nothing new about this. The love for Indian culture is more jingoistic than real. And what better way to show love for Indian culture than by bringing westerners and making them say crappy things about India. It's so old, I don't even think people do that the way they do in this movie. The funny moments are those ridiculous scenes. The best of them is the last scene with Darcy hitting the Dhol.By the Way, through the first half of the movie I thought Aishwarya Rai was the eldest sister. But it seems Namrata Shirodkar is. LOL. Aishwarya Rai looks so much older than Namrata.Gurinder tried too much Marketing while making this film - this film is the worst ever film a man or a woman could make.

Gurinder Chadha has transported Jane Austen's great novel to India. What a charmer this film turns out to be! The adaptation of the novel is excellent as the new locale is incorporated to the story. The incredible Indian colors explode in front of our eyes giving the Western viewers such an opportunity to experience a little taste of India.Asihwarya Rai is without a doubt, one of the most beautiful women working in movies. This gorgeous creature plays Lalita, the unmarried girl at the center of the action. Martin Henderson is the handsome Darcy, the man that falls head over heels after meeting Lalita. Their first moments are awkward, as it's expected when there are a clash of cultures. But it's clear from the beginning is that these two have fallen in love in spite of their differences.The musical numbers are a joy to watch. There is always music and dance in most Indian films. The director, and the choreographer take advantage of the genre in ways that fill our eyes constantly with a dance sequence more lavish than the previous one.In minor roles Daniel Gillies plays Johnny Wickham. Marsha Mason is seen briefly as Mrs. Darcy, a woman whose prejudice against her son's love for Lalita. The cast is wonderful."Bride and Prejudice" is a triumph for director Gurinder Chadha.

When I first started watching Bollywood flicks back in the day, I was always on my high horse (being a connoisseur of independent and foreign cinema that I am), and I was constantly berating these movies which always had seemingly trite plots, typical main characters, and a number of flaws spawning from lazy scriptwriting/editing. Over the years, though, I've continued watching it because I love the sound of the music and the way everything surreally breaks into song and dance -- no matter how ridiculous the music itself is.What Gurinder Chadha has done here is create a very, very solid Bollywood movie. Unlike most Bollywood flicks, "Bride & Prejudice" has a solid script. I can't attest to the effectiveness of the film's adaptation of the novel, but I genuinely loved this movie enough to know that once it becomes available on DVD, I will go out and buy it. The songs are very typical, yes -- as are the dance routines, but that's all this is. I don't think Chadha was aiming to make a be-all, end-all of Bollywood movies to introduce the genre to Western audiences. Another note: everyone seems to comopare this to Chadha's previous flick -- "Bend it Like Beckham" -- the two are incomparable...it's like comparing apples and oranges. This is strictly lighthearted fare and succeeds at it.The acting in the film supports the movie itself. That means that while nothing is exceptional acting, this movie is supposed to just be a feel-good romantic comedy and all the performances in the flick (especially Nadira Babbar's) contribute to that. The jokes -- while some are a bit tired -- deliver the laughs.I also want to disagree with those who complain about the lack of chemistry between Rai and Henderson's characters because I think they work just fine; they're able to show the cultural clash well in the way their characters don't exactly sweep each other off their feet. And Rai needs to be commended for doing what few Bollywood actresses would do: giving up fame and fortune to try new acting prospects.If you're looking for the apex of cinematic art, don't watch this flick, but if you're looking for a two-hour feel-good romp littered with bright colors and toe-tapping musical numbers, this is right up your alley. It gives us a break from the by-the-numbers romantic comedies that Hollywood's been churning out for so many years. One last thing: this film is not Bollywood, but it is done in the style of Bollywood and perhaps that's why the self-conscious aspects of the movie also succeed. The large song and dance routines are a bit random, but then also become part of the backdrop for larger events of the movie to take place.All in all, Chadha's made another great flick! Go check it out if you can!

We saw Bride and Prejudice last night at a special preview showing. It was a lot of fun. I especially enjoyed the singing and dancing. The costumes are colorful and add to the general enjoyment. This movie is based on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, one of my favorite books. It's a good idea, in order to place this story in modern times, to place it in a culture where the children are more protected. I don't think this story would work in the present time if it was in the United States, for example, but this film is a perfect blend. The leading actress is a former Miss World. She is beautiful and talented. This is the first "Bollywood" movie I have seen. I recommend it. The scenes of singing and dancing reminded me of the scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off when everyone in the street was dancing to Twist and Shout.

OK, if you don't like people breaking into song unexpectedly, don't go see this movie - let me just say that upfront!I went to see this re-work of my favourite novel and thought it would be atrocious and envisaged walking out of the theatre in disgust in advance. What I got was an explosion of colour and music, Bollywood style, and sure some of the songs were pretty awful, but hey, there were a few terrible numbers in Grease too, and I still love that movie!The lead players were all virtually unknown to me but they were perfect in their roles. The role of Lalita (the Elizabeth role in the original book) was perfectly cast - she was beautiful and she really held the whole movie together. And Martin Henderson was perfect as the American version of the disdainful Mr Darcy, this time Mr Will Darcy.Go and see this film if you are open to something new - it really is quite a faithful re-work of the story, and it is very entertaining.The only people who won't enjoy this are people who hate musicals with a passion, or people who are purists to the original.If you liked Chicago, then you can definitely enjoy this one too. (That also had some dodgy old songs, but the story carried you past those parts!)Bring on the Bollywood!

A really fun and entertaining movie which doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. Possible SPOILERS ahead for those who haven't read the classic novel or watched the BBC Mini-series.P&P is my all time favourite book and I am a huge fan of the BBC series - Colin Firth was a perfect Darcy and Jennifer Ehle an equally perfect Elizabeth. My main gripes were the costumes (could have been better) and the fact that Darcy begins to fall for Elizabeth (in spite of himself) much earlier in the book than the BBC portrayed. Bride & P does a much better job of these points. The outfits are great as is the fact that Wil (Darcy) fancies Lalitha almost from the beginning. The downside of this version is that it was a little rushed. They could have added on 15/20 mins to fill out the storyline and dialogue, and Darcy is not nearly as proud.The upside is that Bingley is not annoyingly cheerful, he is on the same level as Darcy and a bit of a dish actually. Similarly, Mr. Kholi (or Collins) is a bit sad and irritating rather than nasty. He is the star of this film who absolutely steals EVERY scene he is in. I do think there was chemistry between Ash and Martin and enjoyed their scenes in LA. A longer script would have given Mr. Bakshi more lines of wit, as would have more depth to the character of Darcy, Lalitha, Jaya and Balraj. Also, Wickham's dealings with Darcy's sister could have been a bit more believable with more than just one line.Henderson is not Firth but he was great as Darcy and has those eyes... Ash was beautiful as always - she wasn't Miss World for nothing and her acting will get better with more experience.Despite what seem like many criticisms, this film had a warm, fun feel-good factor that it was supposed to have. Bollywood song and dance routines aside, the lyrics were a bit cheesy but then so are most Rodgers and Hammerstein classics that I grew up watching - but that doesn't make the songs any less fun or catchy. Songs in musicals are rarely meant to change your life - think Grease, the Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, but we still sing along happily to 'raindrops and roses and brown paper bags ...' which if transplanted to a modern movie would be cheesy and corny, but they have the benefit of being called classics from a different era. Well this is a different genre and it works splendidly for me. 'My lips are waiting my hips are shaking, take me to love...' 'No life without wife, oh yeah yeah yeah...' The BBC version was great but filled with 5 hours of solid dialogue, as an Austen fan, I welcome this new perspective on the novel. There is no better way to enjoy such a classic work than to share different takes on it, it makes you appreciate the book even more - I'm off to read it again.

Went to see that movie twice and it only came out on the 22nd December in France!!! Full of color and great music!! If u want to spend a really nice time in cinema and laughing your head off over Mr Kholi, go at once.... And if u wanna check out nice a nice guy , go at least for Mr Will Darcy!! All jokes aside, Ash's first "american" movie is a success. They are all acting greatly and makes us want to go and visit Amritsar!! A big surprise also for hip-hop lovers: Ashanti's appearance for "Payal Bajake"'s song. The landscapes are wonderful. East really meets West.. and it's an enjoyable mix or how to teach a Westerner that he doesn't have it all...And as in all of Chandha movie's, the end is a delight!! ENJOY!!

well what can i say i went to this movie expecting it to be really bad as i am not a big fan of the actress aishwarya rai but i was surprised . one must look at this movie from the point that it was made more like a bolly wood movie that is dramatic , has songs (as all Hindi movies are incomplete with out) and a dash of Indian culture yes the movie is based on pride and prejudice so a lot of people will go expecting it to be like the book and hence will be surprised. the whole point to having an Indian girl who is from a different culture, background,class and country fall in love with a rich ,snobbish American boy is to make it romantic almost i would say like a mills and boons romance. and this is where the movie gets a thumbs up. martin henderson as will darcy looks smashing and plays his role well . this movie is funny as well as emotional and has all the stuff required in making a good movie one must go and see this movie and expect it to be like a bollywood film and the person will not be disappointed.this is a truly different movie and is worth a watch.

Well, it's pretty hard, isn't it, to write a spoiler for a film which is based on such a well-known, well-loved novel! I will show my hand here and say that I am a Janeite. However, I am not a purist and I like many Jane Austen adaptations that many Janeites don't (for example I like 'Mansfield Park'). I enjoyed 'Bride and prejudice' for its colour and fun. The attempt to update 'P&P' to a contemporary Indian setting worked well most of the time, with the translation to India being effective because it is a society where arranged marriages are still an accepted way to go. The script did a pretty good job of capturing the essence of the story whilst playing around with some of the details eg cutting out the fifth daughter whose role in the story is pretty minimal, and making the 'tyrant' in Darcy's life his mother not his aunt (a more realistic situation in its modern setting). I loved the 'no life without a wife' song and dance routine though it reminded me at times of the 'Matchmaker' song in 'Fiddler on the roof'. However, the film suffered a little, for a number of reasons, the main ones being that it left the Bollywood- style when it went to Hollywood (which changed the tone of the film), it didn't really find a good way to make Wickham as wicked as he is in the original, and there did not seem to be the same desperate need to be married as there was for the Bennet sisters in 'P&P'. These modern Indian women had jobs and could, it appeared, be independent without having husbands, removing the urgency that drives its 'P&P' original. Despite this, though, it does manage to incorporate some of the satire against pomposity and the arrogance of the moneyed class that makes 'P&P' more than a simple romance. Overall, then, I found it a fun film and an entertaining take on my favourite novel.

Someone said that Darcy wasn't good looking enough. Are you crazy? He is amazing in this movie, I just saw it and yeah the songs are terrible and I was looking for the fast forward button in the theater but you cant say that the rest of the movie wasn't charming. It was so bollywood I loved it. The no kissing, the whole misunderstanding between girl and boy. It was an entertainer. I think that was the point. Not to win an Oscar or to do great things but to entertain and I think it succeeded in that mission. I think we should stop analyzing every small detail of the movie and just learn to enjoy it. Who didn't laugh when they saw Ashanti. There are humorous parts in the movie that we just have to take and leave the horrible songs behind. For a first run of a mixture between bollywood and Hollywood. I cant say it was too bad.

A Bollywood-style version of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice, Bride & Prejudice tells the story of the Bakshi family, living in a small Indian town with four daughters whom their mother is anxious to marry off. The family knows a few very eligible bachelors (read "rich, successful in business and handsome") from the UK and the US, and the film tells the troubles, triumphs and tragedies surrounding the daughters' relationships with the bachelors.First, I should note that I'm not a huge fan of Bollywood musicals, soap opera-like plots, realist dramas or traditional romance films (traditional both in a filmic sense and in the sense of traditionalist values being espoused). So my rating might reflect that bias. On the other hand, there are films in all of those genres that I do like quite a bit, and my wife, who is Indian and usually enjoys those genres much more than I do, gave Bride & Prejudice an 8, so perhaps my bias wasn't that significant.A 7 from me is equivalent to a "C" letter grade--a passing grade but nothing to be overly proud of. For me, it means the film is average, with as many things done wrong as right. Let's look at the problems I had with Bride & Prejudice first.Director Gurinder Chadha--whose Bend It Like Beckham (2002) I liked a lot--made Bride & Prejudice a bit too sprawling, both in tone and plot. The tone ranges from serious romance to tragedy to parody, but those attitudes are all approached very differently from one another and thus do not mix very well in the film. They instead take turns in a way that will likely result in many viewers preferring one approach over the other and lamenting having to wait for that kind of material to appear again. For example, the parody material worked much better for me, and after awhile, I found myself occasionally growing impatient for it to reappear.The plot, and this may be due to a close parallel with the Austen book, tends to drone on and on, one episode after another, without a clear climax until the very end. The film really could have stopped at any arbitrary point and been satisfactory (except perhaps to those only accepting of a traditional "happy" ending). Once the "riding off into the sunset" climax finally does arrive, it feels more like it took 3 or 4 hours to get there rather than the film's actual running time of just under 2 hours.However, there are a number of positive aspects to note. As I briefly noted above, the more humorous material worked very well for me, and much of the film is humorous. Chadha even made a nice attempt to inject parody into some musical numbers. The number set in the marketplace, with singing vendors and transvestites, and the number set in Los Angeles were particularly funny. There is a very funny scene with one of the Bakshi sisters doing a "snake dance". Even better, all of the material with and about Mr. Kholi (Nitin Chandra Ganatra) was hilarious.The performances are mostly good, although Martin Henderson as Will Darcy remains oddly aloof even when we're supposed to warm up to him. Also, because the film is so sprawling, a few good characters, such as Balraj (Naveen Andrews) and Kiran Bingley (Indira Varma), are mostly lost in the shuffle.The romance and realist drama material occasionally worked for me, and might have worked even better if I hadn't liked the comedy portions so much that I was wishing for their return instead. Overall, Bride & Prejudice is worth seeing, but unless you're a big fan of the genres and don't mind switching gears continually, lower your expectations a bit before watching.

This is a seriously bad movie that I've been unlucky enough to watch.Cons: Bad characterization - both Aishwarya and Martin jump into their pride and prejudice polarities in no time at all - it's as if the director is expecting the audience to know the characters well already.Terrible song-and-dance routines - I don't know if the attempt was to make it a musical, but the routines look terribly shoddy. They neither match Hollywood musical standards, neither are they good Bollywood-type interludes.Poor Acting - Aishwarya overacts and Martin underacts.Terrible view of India - The way Indian arranged marriage and family systems are shown, I'm really surprised how the Indian cast agreed to act in such a movie.

Inspired by Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, this Western-style Bollywood musical can't possibly achieve the heights that a union of the best of East and West movie making and English literature might suggests, but it manages to fulfil a delightful couple of hours of song and dance that Western cinema these days struggles to accomplish.Like the novel, Bride and Prejudice uses the ideas that that first impressions are often wrong, and that a person can mature if he or she keeps an open mind. The unlikely courtship of Mr Darcy and (in our movie) a beautiful Indian girl starts with mutual contempt, but moves forward as they become wiser and learn that their first instincts, based on pride, prejudice and illusions, were wrong.The scene moves between Amritsar and Goa to London and Beverley Hills, all in brighter-than-bright super-saturated colour, with an assortment of equally colourful characters, wonderful costumes, lavish dance pieces and heavenly bollywood-style ballads. While almost everything is in English (except for a few subtitled songs), nearly all the characters are top Indian performers.In the golden age of musicals, stars such as Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire had a whole sub-industry to draw on for good dancers who could also sing and act well, plus the technicians used to producing high-end musicals. As demand waned, so did supply, and the West is now hard pressed to produce song and dance films that don't rely on snappy editing to suggest good dancing from top actors, or heavy coaching to suggest top dancers can act. Bollywood, on the other hand, has no such shortage, and Bride and Prejudice is the sumptuously choreographed musical with Indian dancing that has become nigh impossible with western dancers.Admittedly it's a bit cheesy at times - but it's self-consciously so, and as endearing as warm, gushy Indian hospitality. The sets and dialogue give authentic, if stereotypical, glimpses of Indian life and values. Like many east-meets-west movies, the stereotypes are a handle to allow easy assimilation of foreign ideas, and the heavy Indian involvement wards off any tendency to patronise (which is one of the themes explored in the film).This is not high drama or high art, but it's an accomplished romantic comedy / song-and-dance film, and one that warms the heart and makes you want to wave your arms in the air Indian-dance-style for the sheer joy and exuberance of happy endings.

I am a big Jane Austen fan, and love "Pride and Prejudice." I have seen many versions of it and always enjoy a new twist on the story. I love Bollywood musicals. They are so colorful and full of life and I enjoy listening to the music. A caveat must be spoken here...these are definitely not for everyone. A lot of Americans today think that musicals are hokey; most musicals that are successful in the US are gritty (ex: Chicago, Moulin Rouge, et al). Thiswas definitely more like the Lerner and Loewe or Rodgers andHammerstein musicals of the 40s and 50s. The author of the screenplay did a great job updating the story for today's world. In Austen's time, a young lady could be "ruined" simply by spending the night with a man, regardless of the circumstances, and of course that doesn't play in today's world. I thought the updating was believable and made sense. The musical numbers were brilliantly done and a lot of fun to watch! I know that not everyone will enjoy this, but it was definitely my cup of tea! More, please! Note that if you see this, make sure you don't jump up and leave right away at the end...there is a funny joke regarding the lack of kissing in the movie during the credits...

Some of my friends warned me about it. My sister in law in India said it's a bore....flop. Curiosity kills the cat so I had to rent it. Well she was wrong. It is not just a bore, it is torturous 2 hours of agony. I must admit I had better expectations from Chaddha. Oh well, live and learn. It is a total showdown of mental bankruptcy. Total incompetency. It is not funny, it is not mystery, it is a bad musical at the best. The songs are sung in English that not even Indians can understand. It does not offer any educational value. And I got the feeling the director has gone out of her way to make Indians look greedy, self centered and unrefined.I have been away from India too long and I am not sensitive but this movie gave me creeps.

Vibrant, colorful, hilarious and lively, this movie was a sheer joy to watch. A refreshing take on an old classic. But be warned, this movie will not appeal to everybody - especially those who don't go to watch it with an open mind. Aishwarya Rai looks the best she ever has and turns in a confident performance in her first English speaking role - not always an easy transition. Martin Henderson is handsome and charming and the supporting cast too. But Nitin Ganatra as the comic bride seeking American is the show stealer in his over the top performance as Mr.Kohli. Gurinder Chadha has attempted what few would dare to take on and she's pulled it off. It's a comic tale of love and romance. Thoroughly enjoyable!

We went to see the preview of this movie, hoping it would be similar to Bend it Like Beckam, but it was not what we expected. It was a musical with a twist being that a good portion of the cast was from India. The movie and the music was enchanting and quite different from what we expected. The cast was very attractive, although I had not seen any of the players before they did a very good job, and the female lead had a beautiful voice, and was very attractive. I was surprised to see Marcia Mason in a bit part in this movie, and she has gotten a lot older since the last movie I saw her in. If you want a light hearted movie, go see Bride and Prejudice, you will enjoy this different movie.

I wonder if at any time during the making of this movie writer and director Gurinder Chadha realized her film was going haywire.Actually, a Bollywoodized version of Jane Austen's novel, "Pride and Prejudice," sounds an interesting, enticing premise. But Chadha, who quite successfully turned a conventional coming-of-age, romantic comedy into the enjoyable "Bend it Like Beckham" (2003), fails miserably this time.She seems to have an able and willing cast in "Bride and Prejudice," but they just don't click.The film's two biggest problems: Chadha's insistence on including English-language songs mixed in with a few Hindi Bollywood numbers, and lead actor Martin Henderson as Darcy.The Hindi songs are bouncy, vivacious, fun to watch. They're well choreographed and fit rather nicely into the story. The same cannot be said of the English songs. I've no idea why Chadha decided to add those in this film. They're clunky, awkward and riddled with laughable lyrics. I realize they're not meant to be taken seriously, but they prove to be tremendously distracting and bog down the story.The lyrics? Well, that's just rotten writing there. In one song, Lalitha (Aishwarya Rai) sings, "I want a man who'll give some back/Who'll talk to me and not to my rack." Then there's American actor Henderson. A truly horrid casting choice. Henderson lacks charm, screen presence, creates absolutely no chemistry with Rai. He turns Darcy into an utterly vapid, a complete dullard with no personality.Rai's Lalitha  the Elizabeth Bennet character  comes across as a strikingly smart, clever, intelligent and self-assured woman. That she would find Henderson's Darcy even remotely attractive asks us to suspend our disbelief a bit too much. The Lalitha-Darcy relationship is tough to swallow.In Chadha's defense, it's nice to see Indians speak perfect English. Rai speaks flawlessly and Chadha and co-writer Paul Mayeda Berges don't turn her into a stereotype. I've no idea if Rai is the most beautiful woman on the planet. But I bet she comes darn close.And Rai gives Lalitha a valiant try. But she's saddled with awful dialogue and given poor direction. Also, when a film suddenly stops to turn into a music video, it's hard to get any momentum going. What exactly is the need for the Ashanti performance? Speaking of poor direction and stereotypes, Chadha lets the film come apart completely with the introduction of Mr. Kholi (the film's version of Austen's Mr. Collins), an Indian-born suitor who wants to Lalitha back to his spread in Los Angeles. Nitin Ganatra plays the character so broadly that the caricature gets tiresome within the first few minutes. But we're forced to endure him for too many scenes. It's abundantly clear Chadha deluded herself into thinking this type of over-the-top acting would elicit laughs. Instead, all it does is make you cringe.If screenwriters pen some good roles for her, Rai has a great future ahead of her in English-language movies. She should be more discerning about what roles she picks. Chadha's film falls apart within the first 20 minutes or so and then does nothing to fix itself. It just keeps going from bad to worse and, eventually, turns downright embarrassing.Too bad. This one had potential.

I recently rented this movie and enjoyed it so much that I bought the DVD the next day and have already watched it three times. While I thought the ending was abit abrupt and Lalita fell inlove with Darcy too quickly, I loved this movie. It wasn't overtaxing or edge of your seat or made your mind work, but, it was an entertaining, lovely, cute, colourful and cheerful movie that entertained me and left me smiling which is what movies are supposed to do.While the songs took abit of getting used to the first time, it didn't really bother me the other times and actually enhanced the film.Darcy and Lalita had such great chemistry, Martin Henderson was gorgeous and suitably intense and brooding for the part - although the Darcy character was slightly too nice all the way through the film - the songs were lively and such bright colours and it was so funny. I loved the song No Life Without Wife and the scene afterwards where Darcy grabs Lalita in the rain is so intense.All in all it won't make you jump or make your mind work, but, it will keep you smiling and entertained for a few hours

In Bride and Prejudice  Gurinder Chadha's Bollywood film version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice  a few things are different. There are four daughters instead of five. Only two of these daughters are married by the end of the film, as opposed to the novel where three of them are married to eligible suitors. Will Darcy, played aptly by Martin Henderson, does not exude as much pride as is expected out of his character, while Lalita Bakshi (the film equivalent to Elizabeth Bennet played by Aishwarya Rai) has many judgments to make against other characters where Darcy's pride (or lack thereof) just does not measure up to the full force of her character.Other differences between the novel and the film added and took away from the film. The changes into modern day went flawlessly into the film. Examples of these seamlessly modern day changes included the use of e-mail instead of letters, and going between cities (and countries) rather than large estates in the countryside of England. The supporting cast, integral to the story of Pride and Prejudice, hold up Bride and Prejudice very well. They keep the film moving and insert funny moments as well.Bride and Prejudice becomes slightly confusing after the first third of the film is over when events from the novel become mixed up with additions to the film, as well as when events from the novel end up in a different order on screen than they did on the page. Overall, Bride and Prejudice was a high quality movie-going experience. With a good supporting cast, as well as reasonable performances out of the leading actors, this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel was very enjoyable.

Gurinda (Bend It Like Beckham) Chadha's exuberant Bollywood/chick-lit crossover is so unashamedly feelgood that viewing it is akin to being in a slow motion tornado as it rolls through the world's most colourful flowershop.Relocating Jane Austen's novel of match-making and heartache to a small rural town in India rescues it from being forevermore a period piece by finding a context in which its arranged unions and propriety are still relevant.But, really, any old romantic tale would have worked as well, given that Chadha's mission is to ply the senses with a vibrant kaleidoscopic whirl of colour, dancing and music.And beautiful people, too. India's never looked so ravishing, with nary a pauper in sight as whole streets burst into spontaneous song and dance.But even surrounded by so many fetching profiles, former Miss World Aishwarya Rai rather takes the breath away. It's almost a shame, because her stunning looks almost overshadow the genuinely relaxed charm she exudes as her fiery character Lalita plays loves-me-love-me-not with Martin Henderson's occasionally stuffy and cool-blooded businessman Darcy.Look for anything like social reality and satire in Bride And Prejudice and you'll wind up disappointed but let yourself fall into it with your eyes and ears wide open and there's a good chance it'll run off with your heart  for a couple of hours, at least.

It should first be noted that I'm an occasional fan of Bollywood (meaning I rent the movies occasionally and enjoy them every time I do) and a constant fan of Pride and Prejudice, so I'm familiar both with the genre and the source material, which is not always a good idea when trying to enjoy a movie like this. I laughed long and loud throughout the entire movie (except when I was quietly murmuring "awwww" or "noooo" at the appropriate moments) just like everyone else in the theater. In terms of form, I'd call it a "masala" movie: a mix of Bollywood and Hollywood styles, and whereas Gurinder Chadha's last movie, "Bend it Like Beckham" skewed Western, "B&P" skews Bollywood, with musical numbers and a script that fluctuates a little more quickly between drama and comedy. Nonetheless, it's very _easy_ Bollywood viewing for a Western audience, and the combination is very seldom unharmonious. The dialogue is all in English, and the few musical numbers that aren't are subtitled; there are also fewer musical numbers than there would be in a Bollywood flick, possibly because the film is Hollywood-length rather than Bollywood length, which would have been twice as long. The tone is more consistent than a purely Bollywood movie on the same subject would have been, almost pure romantic comedy. The sheer sense of energy and brightness in most Bollywood movies carries over very well. The singing was, thankfully, dubbed as it is in most Bollywood movies, which does lead to one jarring note: compared to the usual rather richly high-pitched Hindi vocalizations women usually have in Bollywood films, the English dubbing is limp, except for Aishwarya Rai's voice-over, which is an alto with a fair amount of soul. The actual plot would probably have benefited from a Bollywood-length treatment, as parts of it were squashed for time. It actually follows the plot of Pride and Prejudice fairly closely. In general the obstacles and problems in the movie were lighter in tone, because some of the urgency of being a poor unmarried spinster in Regency England simply could not be carried through. However, the scriptwriters similarly lightened the drama of the movie, so it felt pretty balanced, and added some exploration of the similarities and differences of the cultures, which kept a level of richness in the movie. This is what will make me go back to the movie. Gurinder Chadha has taken great delight in playing with the conventions of two different cultural movie styles, and in showing us an India more "real" than even Bollywood sometimes presents it, as well as giving us a "white man in India through the eyes of Indians" movie, instead of Hollywood's normal "India through the eyes of a white man" fare. Indian cultural practices are, thankfully, _not_ explained in the movie anymore than American or British cultural practices are, they're simply lived. The best scene, of many wonderful scenes, for me, was during the closing credits. Gurinder Chadha and her husband re-enact an earlier musical number with Aishwarya Rai and Martin Henderson (Will Darcy) running through fountains except that unlike the actors, they _kiss on the lips_, which never, ever, ever happens in Bollywood movies, and which becomes fairly obvious to the audience of B&P by the end. That may be the one time I laughed where the rest of the auditorium didn't laugh with me; only the half familiar with Bollywood movies did.

I had heard that this movie is not as good as Bend It Like Bekham. But I got the VCD of the Hindi dubbed version titled Balle Balle Amritsar to LA. (All my comments are in relation only to the version I watched.)The title cracked me up some weeks ago. I saw a trailer with Aishwarya Rai dancing with a white guy with water springs shooting up in sky in the background and the white guy sang in Hindi.The first thing wrong with the film is the title. Throughout the movie I could feel the attitude of the maker - trivialising film making. Beckham was funny, but in this one Gurinder Chadha tries to extract humour out of trivialising the art of film making, trivialising her characters and thereby the whole movie. There is hardly a good funny moment in the movie.Just imagine going to a restaurant and ordering every dish they have putting it in a big bucket, mixing it up and hoping that it would taste good. Gurinder tried that. It tastes awful.The characters are poorly sketched. There is no concept of relationship building. The second sentence that people say to each other sounds like they know each other since years. Dialogues have been written with no seriousness or thought. There is too much happening at an unrealistic pace. Somehow the flow and direction of narration lacks credibility. Everything in the movie is fake. The director has made no effort to understand the real people and has gone on her own ride using people for granted. Her understanding of Indians and Westerners - both - is out of the real. There is extreme polarisation. There is nothing new about this. The love for Indian culture is more jingoistic than real. And what better way to show love for Indian culture than by bringing westerners and making them say crappy things about India. It's so old, I don't even think people do that the way they do in this movie. The funny moments are those ridiculous scenes. The best of them is the last scene with Darcy hitting the Dhol.By the Way, through the first half of the movie I thought Aishwarya Rai was the eldest sister. But it seems Namrata Shirodkar is. LOL. Aishwarya Rai looks so much older than Namrata.Gurinder tried too much Marketing while making this film - this film is the worst ever film a man or a woman could make.

Gurinder Chadha has transported Jane Austen's great novel to India. What a charmer this film turns out to be! The adaptation of the novel is excellent as the new locale is incorporated to the story. The incredible Indian colors explode in front of our eyes giving the Western viewers such an opportunity to experience a little taste of India.Asihwarya Rai is without a doubt, one of the most beautiful women working in movies. This gorgeous creature plays Lalita, the unmarried girl at the center of the action. Martin Henderson is the handsome Darcy, the man that falls head over heels after meeting Lalita. Their first moments are awkward, as it's expected when there are a clash of cultures. But it's clear from the beginning is that these two have fallen in love in spite of their differences.The musical numbers are a joy to watch. There is always music and dance in most Indian films. The director, and the choreographer take advantage of the genre in ways that fill our eyes constantly with a dance sequence more lavish than the previous one.In minor roles Daniel Gillies plays Johnny Wickham. Marsha Mason is seen briefly as Mrs. Darcy, a woman whose prejudice against her son's love for Lalita. The cast is wonderful."Bride and Prejudice" is a triumph for director Gurinder Chadha.

OK Bollywood-style rendering of the famous drama. The cheesy feel of many scenes is a logical result of the forced blending of the (assumed) politically correct feel-good dogma of Hollywood and easy-going sugar sweet Bollywood fashion. There are some pretty funny (though predictable) scenes and the story is told in a fast pace, without too many endless songs. The way the makers adapted the original story of Pride & Prejudice is applaudable: accurate but with enough freedom to create a product of its own. We get a good view of the trappings of cultural prejudices in an original but sometimes corny manner. It remains a fact that the Mr. Darcy of the '90's British version of P & P is never to be surpassed...

This film was awful. I am a fan of the original Jane Austin "Pride and Prejudice" from whence this movie was based. This version has very little redeeming qualities. The dance scenes seemed to be forced and did not flow well with the story line. Just a bunch of pretty girls dancing seductive dances with little rhyme or reason. The vocal numbers were good but obviously dubbed. Aishwarya is constantly slamming the US and our culture. It seems like the director's only way to elevate Indian culture and ideals is to make frequent and glaring jabs at American lifestyles and views. Even Darcy seems to get into the deprecation of the US and what it stands for in order to win Aishwarya's affection.I don't mind poking fun at oneself. However, when the movie seems to center on this thesis and when the poking is from another culture, it seemed more like mud slinging.It was like watching 2 immature children interacting: one constantly putting down the other to draw attention to and elevate oneself.

When I first started watching Bollywood flicks back in the day, I was always on my high horse (being a connoisseur of independent and foreign cinema that I am), and I was constantly berating these movies which always had seemingly trite plots, typical main characters, and a number of flaws spawning from lazy scriptwriting/editing. Over the years, though, I've continued watching it because I love the sound of the music and the way everything surreally breaks into song and dance -- no matter how ridiculous the music itself is.What Gurinder Chadha has done here is create a very, very solid Bollywood movie. Unlike most Bollywood flicks, "Bride & Prejudice" has a solid script. I can't attest to the effectiveness of the film's adaptation of the novel, but I genuinely loved this movie enough to know that once it becomes available on DVD, I will go out and buy it. The songs are very typical, yes -- as are the dance routines, but that's all this is. I don't think Chadha was aiming to make a be-all, end-all of Bollywood movies to introduce the genre to Western audiences. Another note: everyone seems to comopare this to Chadha's previous flick -- "Bend it Like Beckham" -- the two are incomparable...it's like comparing apples and oranges. This is strictly lighthearted fare and succeeds at it.The acting in the film supports the movie itself. That means that while nothing is exceptional acting, this movie is supposed to just be a feel-good romantic comedy and all the performances in the flick (especially Nadira Babbar's) contribute to that. The jokes -- while some are a bit tired -- deliver the laughs.I also want to disagree with those who complain about the lack of chemistry between Rai and Henderson's characters because I think they work just fine; they're able to show the cultural clash well in the way their characters don't exactly sweep each other off their feet. And Rai needs to be commended for doing what few Bollywood actresses would do: giving up fame and fortune to try new acting prospects.If you're looking for the apex of cinematic art, don't watch this flick, but if you're looking for a two-hour feel-good romp littered with bright colors and toe-tapping musical numbers, this is right up your alley. It gives us a break from the by-the-numbers romantic comedies that Hollywood's been churning out for so many years. One last thing: this film is not Bollywood, but it is done in the style of Bollywood and perhaps that's why the self-conscious aspects of the movie also succeed. The large song and dance routines are a bit random, but then also become part of the backdrop for larger events of the movie to take place.All in all, Chadha's made another great flick! Go check it out if you can!

Since I really like Bollywood's productions and this one has Aishwarya Rai in it I was almost sure that it will be really nice. And it almost is. The story is nice - the convention of Bollywood romances does not require originality but this one has some twist being quite interesting adaptation of famous Jane Austen novel. The cast is good - aforementioned Aishwarya as always is a bright star but the whole crew performance is really good. Moreover if you liked Gilmore Girls as I did series you will have the pleasure to see Alexis Bledel on screen again (even if for quite a short role). So why it was not as good as it should be? Well... the movie is made entirely in English. That's the first though not the biggest problem. After all in Bollywood movies sometimes even about half of the dialogs are in English mixed with Hindi. But here it is just to much. The movie lacks the "indian" feel. Can't really name the problem here but it is just not right. But the most important mistake in this picture is the music. There are no Bollywood romance without good music and this movie has it all wrong! I do not know why but producers apparently decided to do something new and all the songs in the movie are American/European/Latino style instead of good old Bollywood, sung in English. It sounds like watching Evita especially, that the style of most of those songs really resembles the early Madonna works. And it is just wrong.... I do not have anything against "early Madonna" but this just does not work here. There is much less Bollywood mood in it and therefore the movie lacks character and is far weaker than it could be.

I'm getting tired of this East-meets-West mergers among foreign Indian film makers. "Bride and Prejudice" is another one of these films, and it belongs in the dumpster outside the movie theater. First, you get a Caucasian who speaks Hindi fluently, but no reason why...the last time I saw this was in "Shalimar" with Rex Harrison...wasn't pretty then, wasn't pretty now. Second, my wife had read "Pride and Prejudice", and loved it; when she saw the film, she said it had no relation to the book and the film butchered the whole story line. Furthermore, my wife tells me that Aishwarya Rai decimated the Elizabeth/Lalita character. According to the trivia in IMDb, she did not read the book because she wouldn't get influenced. Maybe she should have. My theory is that she was too lazy to read the book, and figured her looks would carry the film--they don't. Finally, the film is without direction. Is is a Bollywood satire? Or is it a Bollywood version of "Pride and Prejudice"? Or is it a Bollywood film with one Caucasian? Or is it a criticism/analysis of Indian culture? I just didn't get this film. Messy, plot less, and humiliating to Indians, this not a good introduction to Bollywood. A better example (and a "natural product")of Bollywood would be the film "Lagaan", which you can get at almost any video rental store in the US.
