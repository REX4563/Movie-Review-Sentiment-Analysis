What I appreciated most about Love Actually was that for the most part, it realistically looks at relationships happy and sad, successful and unsuccessful, with a future and without.  It addresses different forms and levels of love, sometimes straightforward and carefree, sometimes complex and contradictory.  There are schmaltzy happy moments and touching sad ones, moments of great strength and moments of foolish weakness.  The movie is made up of many threads, and of course some threads are stronger than others.The most interesting parts of Love Actually are the times when it addresses the tragic situations where love is self-sacrificing, contradictory, or fragile.  One character's unrequited love is revealed as a noble sacrifice made for another's happiness (the method of finally achieving closure and moving on, however, could only work in the movies).  Another character is shown to be caught between conflicting duties that will, we are led to believe, prevent her from ever being truly happy.  And the strength that a third shows when love is shown to be fragile and her world collapses around her is tragically inspiring.These noble, tragic threads are interwoven with lighthearted comedic ones to produce a fabric that holds together well.  While some characters have to fight for their love, others have simple, happy, straightforward relationships, with love (or whatever) falling in their laps like a parcel from Santa Claus.  And the purely comic moments, like Rowan Atkinson's appearances and Hugh Grant's Christmas-caroling bodyguard, are delightful in and of themselves.There are of course plenty of nits to pick.  Hugh Grant doesn't make a very believable Prime Minister, and even his very pointed speech to his American counterpart -- especially relevant in light of Bush's recent state visit to England -- don't redeem the odd casting.  Others in this forum have commented on the number of fat jokes in the film, and while I agree, I feel I should point out that the entire point of the first such joke is that the character who has fallen for the "fat" girl clearly doesn't think of her as fat, and doesn't understand at first who the other is talking about. It's true that calling her fat is ridiculous; she's only large in comparison to Keira Knightley, who must be carrying some vital organs around in her handbag because there's certainly not enough room in her torso!  But that one time would have been enough; the "fat" theme gets tiresome later on in the movie.  I also agree with those who have said that much of the nudity is completely unnecessary to the plot, and that at least some of the comedic threads in the movie are formulaic and unoriginal.In the end, I feel that Love Actually is for the most part a thoughtful and entertaining look at relationships, which does not shy away from taking the bad with the good.

This was a lovely script, and I was surprised I hadn't heard much about this movie before I caught it on HBO. I turned it on to keep myself company while working and ended up glued to the screen. I really enjoyed it.The movie is a series of vignettes about several different people that seemingly have no connection to one another, although by the end the connections are finally all present and accounted for. There's a fair amount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the characters are quite human and often don't do the right thing. I was caught off-guard by the incredibly successful results of the trip to America, but I laughed pretty hard and decided I wouldn't have written the script any other way. Not everyone ends up getting what they want, but then again that's love, er, actually. Nice little film.

It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded.I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is ... what?Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered by language or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all of the above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrific script. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience; not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience the film. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothing more of them left.**** (A)

I have lost count of how many times I have watched this wonderfully written and acted Christmas romance themed classic film. At least once a year so that would be at least seventeen (17) times now. Great songs, a superb cast from top to bottom, heartwarming romances, and of course a must see "FEEL GOOD" ending.It is most deserving of a perfect 10 for 10 IMDB rating.

This movie does come off as a bit shallow, and it contains characters who are one- dimensional caricatures of themselves. But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is "number one for Christmas" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to be taken as a "serious" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take it for the fantasy that it is. I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught it first in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to back on a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal "Cheaper by the Dozen" and "Duplex." Since I've caught it on HBO, and I've quickly realized it's one of those movies you can watch repeatedly when flipping channels for a quick "pick me up" that only fantasy movies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, if that clues you into my argument. The multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes of Magnolia, and the fact that it's a light hearted holiday theme flick place that device in interesting contrast. I see Love Actually as a new holiday classic.

A unique movie with a lot of stories being portrayed simultaneously.The songs of this movie are absolutely amazing. It makes transports you, and makes you feel the exact emotion being portrayed.My take on each sub stories:
#1 The Prime Minister's story seems a bit foolish, but I like his guts and humbleness.#2 The Novelist seems pretty dumb, and I didn't like that story much, but I guess it showcases that love doesn't need language, it is based on someone's character. Even if you can't understand anything, the way someone behaves, a person's character reveals a lot about him/her.#3 The stepfather and son combo is what I loved a lot. A supportive father, who teaches about love and supports his dream and pushes him to be better. That touched my heart.#4 The husband and wife. The guy should have never ever tried to cheat on his wife, a man who cheats or at least tries to cheat isn't a man. A true man realizes his wife's sacrifices, love and support, and wouldn't fall for infatuations.#5 The Girl with the mentally ill brother. If the guy loved her for who she is, for all her goodness, quirks, faults, and family, then he would have not left her. The guy was only there for the sex. He isn't genuinely interested in her. If he was, he would have supported her in her journey.#6 The story of the best friend seemed stupid also. But I liked how that story ended.#7 The story of the two stand-in actors is the most funny and wicked. The innocence of the two is really cute and heartwarming.# Special mention to Rowan Atkinson. I don't know if anyone noticed, but he felt like a god's angel. Being there at the right place at the right time. His role might seem small, but it has deep significance in the whole spiderweb of encounters and outcomes.Never have regret in life. Always do the things you want to do in life. It might not always be the right or wrong decision, as there is never a right decision. Each decision teaches us lots of important life lessons. Learn from each lesson and keep living life.Love actually might seem foolish, but it portrays the different kinds of love out there. Love might seem stupid, foolish and impractical. But it's one of life's purpose. Humans are built to find their passion and purpose in life, along with sharing his/her life with a love of his/her life.What is the point of all the money, adventure, experience if you don't have someone to share and enjoy it with. Every good experience and good news, first thing that you would want to do, would be to share that news with the people whom you love. If sharing your life, the good times and the bad times, with the people whom you love, isn't life aim of life. Then what is the point of living life?You only have one life, so life it to the fullest.Hope you find the love of your life someday to share your life with.

Love actually is probably one of the most positively uplifting films of all time. No one should go into this expecting something bold or novel or profound. It is shallow, trite, naive, and confounding. But it is also charming. Indeed The films strength lies entirely with allowing us suspend our disbelief and be absorbed by its charm. When attempting to judge the film with a disinterested eye, many flaws emerge. The film is too long yet too short- there are too many characters vying for screen time in a 2 and one quarter hour long romcom(most romcoms are 1 and a half hours long). I would have much preferred it if the film were less ambitious and stuck with just 3 characters, maybe the Collin Firth, Hugh Grant, and Keira Knightley characters, for I feel these characters' stories were the most charming of them all. The film also has a tendency to veer towards corniness and sentimentality, and much of the dialogue is terribly average. But I don't care. Especially for the first hour or so, Love actually succeeds in persuading the massive cynic that I am in being absorbed by the film. And that for me is an achievement for any romcom.

It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me smile, hug everyone, tell everyone how much I loved them!!! I think the music is the true soul of this movie. Cheers for the director!!! So many beautiful films he's been doing for so long!!! There was no need of marvelous photography, neither splendorous costume...but every detail was placed perfectly. Excellent actors and performances. It was a very good combination of experienced ones and some others one had never seen before. I liked very much how the director showed how open minded the English people are, by the way Liam Neeson talked to Sam and some other aspects on other dialogues as well (related to sex) It is remarkable also the way they mention the American society. Not criticizing the people and the culture, buy yes the government. CONGRATULATIONS ENGLAND!!!!

6 bags of popcorn for Love Actually. It's in fact love, actually, actually love.What a roller coaster of a film. I watched it for the first time this year and wow, what a classic. There are many characters and many of them are in love, actually.They are not only in love, actually, but are actually pretty cool people too. There's the writer guy, and the British guy, and those models or something and I think there's a kid too and all of them are, yep you guessed it, in love, actually.I did actually love the movie Love Actually. My brother in law says it's him and his dad's favorite holiday movie. I'm more of an Elf person myself. When buddy eats the spaghetti with syrup, oh boy, it's a riot, actually.Highly recommend this as a yearly must watch. And if possible, sit down with someone who hasn't see it yet. I think they're gonna love it, actually.

In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month after Christmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and the member of his household, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), her husband Harry (Alam Rickman) and Harry's secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsch); Harry's employees, Sarah (Laura Linney), a woman with a serious problem in her life, and the designer Karl (Rodrigo Santoro); the writer Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz); the grieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his son, Sam; a porn actress and her colleague; the singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) and his manager; the just married couple Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) and their best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln); a British young man that travels to USA, trying to score women in that country. "Love Actually" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Simplesmente Amor" ("Simply Love")

Love Actually is a British move about eight couples and their struggles with love.Like Valentine's Day, Love Actually features an a-list celebrity cast; Hugh Grant, Liam Neesan and Kiera Knightly to name a few. The plot of Love Actually is more real and down to earth than your typical American romantic comedy. Most of the character's stories are simple and you can see them in everyday life. The common issues some of these people are dealing with makes the characters more likable and makes the movie feel more personal.Grant plays the prime minister of England and falls in love with a member of his maid staff. Neesan is helping his ten-year-old stepson tell the love of his young life how he feels. Colin Firth just found out his girlfriend is cheating on him with his younger brother and moves to the country where he falls for a woman who does not speak a lick of English.At times the movie does feel a little rushed because of all the completely separate plots going on. At times it can get confusing and a lot of times viewers will be wondering why they haven't seen much of a certain characters in what feels like a long time.All the actors in this movie did a good job for how little screen time they had. Only a really talented group of actors could draw an audience into the characters and story as quick as that group did.Love Actually may not be completely realistic but it does what it aims for. It is a solid feel-good movie that does not make you cringe the entire film. This is not an artistically crafted love story, it's a simple movie meant to convey one simple idea; "love actually is all around."

This was a most intriguing film. There are of course other reviews of it here, but the one common theme that seems to exist in all reviews is the simple fact that you can never please all the people all of the time.For myself I loved the film and the way that all the stories were intertwined. You could spend ages just trying to work out where the various connections between the story lines actually were.But there were two very special moments for me in this film. One was where Mark (Andrew Lincoln) finally told Juliet(Keira Knightley ) how he REALLY felt about her, through the medium of the messages on the cards, (surely many of us have experienced that sort of unrequited love), the other was the brilliant brief speech given by the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) to the press conference at which the American President was present. (Both of these appear as quotes elsewhere on this site.) I felt that it was a very brave move on the part of the writer (Richard Curtis) to allow the Prime Minister in the film to state what so many ordinary British people are feeling about America and its politics right now. I also feel that we, the British, are finally beginning to move away from under the Hollywood shadow, and are starting once again to produce some really excellent films of our own. And for me, this film just underlines this fact. May this trend continue. Claire Rosemary Jane.

I just adore this movie. Every year I watch it multiple times at Christmas. So many stories all woven together seamlessly with highs and lows across the emotional spectrum.There's a nice mix of actors and they all fit their roles so nicely. The exploration of love and what it means to different people along with what it can cause us to do is all covered.Even having watched it so many times I still get lost in the different storylines and even forget some only to suddenly remember them part of the way through.If you haven't already seen it then do yourself a favour and watch it!---------

Excellent writing, ridiculously strong cast. Grab your favorite holiday drink & snack, put your feet up and prepare to be thoroughly entertained - superb stuff from writer director Richard Curtis.

I'm a pretty cynical person but this movie helps remind me of how important the live in my life is. I've watched it countless times and each time, it gets better. Family love, friendship love, partnership love makes this film so readily available to everyone. It hits in all the right spots from STELLAR acting to phenomenal writing and directing. My only gripe is the lack of diversity but the director and writer has even publicly agreed with that. The score is iconic, the plot is so loveable, the characters redeemably quaint. I honestly question people who dislike this film or haven't seen it in the 20 years it's existed.

Love Actually is an almost perfect comedy. It tells many different stories simultaneously and every single one of them is engaging and funny. Because of the multiple plots the spectator doesn't have time to get bored. The different scenarios are quite diverse and depict people of different ages, cultures, wealth. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that the spectator finds at least one of the stories relatable. Every character goes through ups and downs but the movie rewards us with a feel-good ending, which makes it a perfect Christmas and family movie. I truly believe that love actually is a benchmark for all comedies and Christmas movies out there.

Heartwarming and enchanting romantic comedyThe film boasts an ensemble cast of talented actors, each portraying interconnected characters whose lives and stories weave together in a delightful tapestry of love and relationships.From the heartwarming romance between Mark and Juliet, played by Andrew Lincoln and Keira Knightley, to the bittersweet and touching tale of David and Natalie, portrayed by Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon, Love Actually captures a range of emotions and experiences in love.The film's charm lies in its ability to showcase various forms of love - from the innocence of young love to the complexities of long-term relationships. It celebrates the power of love to transcend barriers and connect people from different walks of life.Love Actually also benefits from its well-crafted and often witty script, which brings humor and authenticity to the characters' interactions and conversations.The soundtrack of Love Actually is another highlight, featuring iconic songs that perfectly complement the film's emotional moments and add to its heartwarming appeal.While some may argue that the film's interconnected stories may feel a bit contrived, the ensemble cast and the genuine moments of connection and affection between characters more than make up for it.In conclusion, Love Actually is a delightful and heartwarming romantic comedy that captures the essence of love in all its forms. With its talented cast, touching stories, and memorable soundtrack, it has earned its place as a beloved holiday favorite.If you're looking for a feel-good movie that celebrates love and the human spirit, Love Actually is the perfect choice.

Love Actually is a lot like actual love---it's wonderful until it isn't. Then everything blows up, leaving you to pick up the pieces of your devastated reality.Relax. I'm only kidding. Love really is wonderful, even the struggles. The movie Love Actually, not so much.The first 30 minutes or so are downright hilarious, featuring a mix of charming British humor and broader appeal jokes as well. The setup of each storyline features likable characters in relatable situations. You root for everything to work out. You want all of them to be happy.Then, through no fault of the characters, you change your attitude. Instead of rooting for the characters, you become apathetic, at best. Why? Because the movie makes every story nauseating with irritatingly manipulative music, cuts to closeups of hopeful or gleeful faces to force viewers to elicit the "hooray" emotions. It's all very painful and frustrating.The movie is called Love Actually (which is a great title, by the way), but so little of what occurs in the movie can be passed off as something that would actually happen. A more appropriate title would be Love Fantasy.Thirty minutes into the movie (again, the beginning shows promise and is mostly delightful), all the believable buildups have morphed into shameless fairy tale-like sequences. It's all a bunch of love at first sight silliness. Sorry if this sounds too harsh, but there is no love at first sight. The very concept is shallow and supposes a fundamental misunderstanding of what love is. There can be attraction at first sight, or lust at first sight. But not love.The most ghastly instance of using music to manipulate the viewers comes during a scene when two people, who have never spoken a word to each other because they don't speak the same language, develop feelings for each other. That is an interesting idea that could have been quite moving if handled deftly. Instead, the moment is a bit more blunt. The music indicates that the man develops loving feelings for the woman when she takes off all her clothes to jump in a lake. Viewers are led to believe that the man felt little for this woman until he saw that she looked good in her underwear, after which he fell in love with her.So, I guess the message is that you can love someone that you've never spoken to as long and the other person is attractive. It's basically a different version of that thing in movies when the dorky girl takes off her glasses then everyone realizes that she's beautiful and then the main guy character can love her now. The biggest difference between those two cases is that the dorky girl removing her glasses moment usually happens in a movie that clearly isn't taking itself too seriously, whereas Love Actually is posing as a movie that represents realistic love. That's sad to me because many viewers, especially the impressionable young ones, may walk away from this movie confusing attraction for love.Since I'm unleashing all my gripes with this movie, I may as well mention one more. This one didn't so much make me mad, as much as it confused me. It is also kind of funny in a way. I'm talking about the portrayal of the U.S. President (the movie takes place in England). It casts him as this arrogant, smug, woman harassing pig. Basically, he's a bully. So, when one of the British characters stands up to him, the music swoons once again, indicating to the audience that they should be happy that the American jerk couldn't push people around anymore.To be honest, I have no idea if this is the perception that people in England have of Americans. Perhaps it is, and the viewers from England really did applaud this moment. But I personally found it all to be laughably cheesy.That's a pretty accurate summary of my take on the movie overall---laughably cheesy. I'll just leave it at that. I recommend that you take a hard pass on Love Actually.

Like most guys I would never have seen this movie on my own or with male friends. However my girlfriend was in town and I thought a romantic comedy would make an ideal movie for us to see together.I had heard about the reference to 9/11 made at the beginning of the movie and was dreading having to sit through that part. However I was pleasantly surprised to note that the reference was very minor and not particularly cringe worthy either so I am not quite sure why it annoyed some people so much.As regards to the movie overall I quite enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it as an ideal date film. A lot of the reviews here have disparaged the movie because they thought it was too glib about love and very unrealistic. But I think you have to accept that the movie was made to make people laugh and bring the spirit of love into the Christmas holiday period. If you watch the film in that context then it does its job admirably well.However for me the best moment in the film was the press conference given (standing side by side) by the American president and the British Prime Minister. I actually felt like standing up and cheering when Hugh Grant (as the Prime Minister) finally tells the American president to his face and in front of the worlds press that Britain will no longer kowtow to American wishes but will have an independent view of its own.Considering that America is the biggest market for movies it was extremely brave of Richard Curtis to write this scene and he deserves a lot of credit for portraying the American president as rather loathsome and putting into context what the `Special Relationship' really is all about.As Richard Curtis must have known the movie had done okay but not great in the States. However it has cleaned up here in the UK and I'm sure will do very well in the rest of the world too.So Bravo Richard Curtis for standing up for your principals; you are a hero!

I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.And the introductory voice-over by Hugh Grant as we watch an airport full of people hugging made me want to commit an act of violence - either against the people who forced me to watch this film or against myself just to end the torture.Then the most unbelievably shocking thing happened. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, "Love is all Around" and I found myself getting sucked into the film.By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable. No-one was more shocked than I.Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there's 8 storylines and the biggest cast list I've seen in a long time. Somehow, it works. You'd think it wouldn't, I know I certainly didn't.
If you're looking for a full-length story, this is not the film for you. It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I've seen in recent times, however (I'm just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films).It's not trying to be the meaning of life, it's not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it's only trying to do one thing, and that's say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn't end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind.This film isn't perfect, I'll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It's superficially complicated but is really a very simple film.  It makes a statement: "love actually is all around" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn't attempt to do or be anything else.And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition.I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I've read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It's like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it.Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually.

What I appreciated most about Love Actually was that for the most part, it realistically looks at relationships happy and sad, successful and unsuccessful, with a future and without.  It addresses different forms and levels of love, sometimes straightforward and carefree, sometimes complex and contradictory.  There are schmaltzy happy moments and touching sad ones, moments of great strength and moments of foolish weakness.  The movie is made up of many threads, and of course some threads are stronger than others.The most interesting parts of Love Actually are the times when it addresses the tragic situations where love is self-sacrificing, contradictory, or fragile.  One character's unrequited love is revealed as a noble sacrifice made for another's happiness (the method of finally achieving closure and moving on, however, could only work in the movies).  Another character is shown to be caught between conflicting duties that will, we are led to believe, prevent her from ever being truly happy.  And the strength that a third shows when love is shown to be fragile and her world collapses around her is tragically inspiring.These noble, tragic threads are interwoven with lighthearted comedic ones to produce a fabric that holds together well.  While some characters have to fight for their love, others have simple, happy, straightforward relationships, with love (or whatever) falling in their laps like a parcel from Santa Claus.  And the purely comic moments, like Rowan Atkinson's appearances and Hugh Grant's Christmas-caroling bodyguard, are delightful in and of themselves.There are of course plenty of nits to pick.  Hugh Grant doesn't make a very believable Prime Minister, and even his very pointed speech to his American counterpart -- especially relevant in light of Bush's recent state visit to England -- don't redeem the odd casting.  Others in this forum have commented on the number of fat jokes in the film, and while I agree, I feel I should point out that the entire point of the first such joke is that the character who has fallen for the "fat" girl clearly doesn't think of her as fat, and doesn't understand at first who the other is talking about. It's true that calling her fat is ridiculous; she's only large in comparison to Keira Knightley, who must be carrying some vital organs around in her handbag because there's certainly not enough room in her torso!  But that one time would have been enough; the "fat" theme gets tiresome later on in the movie.  I also agree with those who have said that much of the nudity is completely unnecessary to the plot, and that at least some of the comedic threads in the movie are formulaic and unoriginal.In the end, I feel that Love Actually is for the most part a thoughtful and entertaining look at relationships, which does not shy away from taking the bad with the good.

This was a lovely script, and I was surprised I hadn't heard much about this movie before I caught it on HBO. I turned it on to keep myself company while working and ended up glued to the screen. I really enjoyed it.The movie is a series of vignettes about several different people that seemingly have no connection to one another, although by the end the connections are finally all present and accounted for. There's a fair amount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the characters are quite human and often don't do the right thing. I was caught off-guard by the incredibly successful results of the trip to America, but I laughed pretty hard and decided I wouldn't have written the script any other way. Not everyone ends up getting what they want, but then again that's love, er, actually. Nice little film.

It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded.I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is ... what?Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered by language or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all of the above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrific script. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience; not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience the film. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothing more of them left.**** (A)

I have lost count of how many times I have watched this wonderfully written and acted Christmas romance themed classic film. At least once a year so that would be at least seventeen (17) times now. Great songs, a superb cast from top to bottom, heartwarming romances, and of course a must see "FEEL GOOD" ending.It is most deserving of a perfect 10 for 10 IMDB rating.

This movie does come off as a bit shallow, and it contains characters who are one- dimensional caricatures of themselves. But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is "number one for Christmas" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to be taken as a "serious" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take it for the fantasy that it is. I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught it first in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to back on a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal "Cheaper by the Dozen" and "Duplex." Since I've caught it on HBO, and I've quickly realized it's one of those movies you can watch repeatedly when flipping channels for a quick "pick me up" that only fantasy movies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, if that clues you into my argument. The multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes of Magnolia, and the fact that it's a light hearted holiday theme flick place that device in interesting contrast. I see Love Actually as a new holiday classic.

A unique movie with a lot of stories being portrayed simultaneously.The songs of this movie are absolutely amazing. It makes transports you, and makes you feel the exact emotion being portrayed.My take on each sub stories:
#1 The Prime Minister's story seems a bit foolish, but I like his guts and humbleness.#2 The Novelist seems pretty dumb, and I didn't like that story much, but I guess it showcases that love doesn't need language, it is based on someone's character. Even if you can't understand anything, the way someone behaves, a person's character reveals a lot about him/her.#3 The stepfather and son combo is what I loved a lot. A supportive father, who teaches about love and supports his dream and pushes him to be better. That touched my heart.#4 The husband and wife. The guy should have never ever tried to cheat on his wife, a man who cheats or at least tries to cheat isn't a man. A true man realizes his wife's sacrifices, love and support, and wouldn't fall for infatuations.#5 The Girl with the mentally ill brother. If the guy loved her for who she is, for all her goodness, quirks, faults, and family, then he would have not left her. The guy was only there for the sex. He isn't genuinely interested in her. If he was, he would have supported her in her journey.#6 The story of the best friend seemed stupid also. But I liked how that story ended.#7 The story of the two stand-in actors is the most funny and wicked. The innocence of the two is really cute and heartwarming.# Special mention to Rowan Atkinson. I don't know if anyone noticed, but he felt like a god's angel. Being there at the right place at the right time. His role might seem small, but it has deep significance in the whole spiderweb of encounters and outcomes.Never have regret in life. Always do the things you want to do in life. It might not always be the right or wrong decision, as there is never a right decision. Each decision teaches us lots of important life lessons. Learn from each lesson and keep living life.Love actually might seem foolish, but it portrays the different kinds of love out there. Love might seem stupid, foolish and impractical. But it's one of life's purpose. Humans are built to find their passion and purpose in life, along with sharing his/her life with a love of his/her life.What is the point of all the money, adventure, experience if you don't have someone to share and enjoy it with. Every good experience and good news, first thing that you would want to do, would be to share that news with the people whom you love. If sharing your life, the good times and the bad times, with the people whom you love, isn't life aim of life. Then what is the point of living life?You only have one life, so life it to the fullest.Hope you find the love of your life someday to share your life with.

Love Actually is a great movie with several well developed story lines that all come together nicely and a terrific cast that can be both comedic and dramatic. It certainly wasn't an easy film to make and I'm sure the studio must have considered it a huge risk, telling stories from several characters in the space of two hours, with all of them having little to no connection with the others, but it worked, Richard Curtis clearly put hard work in to this script and gathered a very impressive cast to make it a hit. Of course, with the amount of stories there are, some of them felt underdeveloped, I found Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's to be one of the most compelling, but in the great their story dosen't get any proper closure, Colin Firth's story felt very tight, I would like to have seen more of him with Sienna Guillory, but with a film as crowded as this you are going to feel underwhelmed with certain parts. The films cast really is terrific and is the main reason why a story as complicated and messy as this really works, Liam Neeson shines as a step dad hoping to cheer up the son of his deceased wife, Emma Thompson is delightful as a wife questioning her own decisions, Alan Rickman astounds as a confused husband, Hugh Grant is terrific as a prime minister who discovers love for the first time, every actor puts all their heart in to these roles and they are all a delight to watch. However, the best performance for me would have to be Bill Nighy, who shines in every scene as Billy Mack, playing a character in no way similar to any role he has done previously, he plays a straight up pompous musician, and he does it ridiculously well. Always a fun film to watch at Christmas time, Love Actually is funny, emotional and very sweet, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance film. Set one month before Christmas, we follow the lives of several people falling in or out of love. Best Performance: Bill Nighy

6 bags of popcorn for Love Actually. It's in fact love, actually, actually love.What a roller coaster of a film. I watched it for the first time this year and wow, what a classic. There are many characters and many of them are in love, actually.They are not only in love, actually, but are actually pretty cool people too. There's the writer guy, and the British guy, and those models or something and I think there's a kid too and all of them are, yep you guessed it, in love, actually.I did actually love the movie Love Actually. My brother in law says it's him and his dad's favorite holiday movie. I'm more of an Elf person myself. When buddy eats the spaghetti with syrup, oh boy, it's a riot, actually.Highly recommend this as a yearly must watch. And if possible, sit down with someone who hasn't see it yet. I think they're gonna love it, actually.

It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me smile, hug everyone, tell everyone how much I loved them!!! I think the music is the true soul of this movie. Cheers for the director!!! So many beautiful films he's been doing for so long!!! There was no need of marvelous photography, neither splendorous costume...but every detail was placed perfectly. Excellent actors and performances. It was a very good combination of experienced ones and some others one had never seen before. I liked very much how the director showed how open minded the English people are, by the way Liam Neeson talked to Sam and some other aspects on other dialogues as well (related to sex) It is remarkable also the way they mention the American society. Not criticizing the people and the culture, buy yes the government. CONGRATULATIONS ENGLAND!!!!

Love actually is probably one of the most positively uplifting films of all time. No one should go into this expecting something bold or novel or profound. It is shallow, trite, naive, and confounding. But it is also charming. Indeed The films strength lies entirely with allowing us suspend our disbelief and be absorbed by its charm. When attempting to judge the film with a disinterested eye, many flaws emerge. The film is too long yet too short- there are too many characters vying for screen time in a 2 and one quarter hour long romcom(most romcoms are 1 and a half hours long). I would have much preferred it if the film were less ambitious and stuck with just 3 characters, maybe the Collin Firth, Hugh Grant, and Keira Knightley characters, for I feel these characters' stories were the most charming of them all. The film also has a tendency to veer towards corniness and sentimentality, and much of the dialogue is terribly average. But I don't care. Especially for the first hour or so, Love actually succeeds in persuading the massive cynic that I am in being absorbed by the film. And that for me is an achievement for any romcom.

In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month after Christmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and the member of his household, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), her husband Harry (Alam Rickman) and Harry's secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsch); Harry's employees, Sarah (Laura Linney), a woman with a serious problem in her life, and the designer Karl (Rodrigo Santoro); the writer Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz); the grieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his son, Sam; a porn actress and her colleague; the singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) and his manager; the just married couple Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) and their best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln); a British young man that travels to USA, trying to score women in that country. "Love Actually" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Simplesmente Amor" ("Simply Love")

Love Actually is a British move about eight couples and their struggles with love.Like Valentine's Day, Love Actually features an a-list celebrity cast; Hugh Grant, Liam Neesan and Kiera Knightly to name a few. The plot of Love Actually is more real and down to earth than your typical American romantic comedy. Most of the character's stories are simple and you can see them in everyday life. The common issues some of these people are dealing with makes the characters more likable and makes the movie feel more personal.Grant plays the prime minister of England and falls in love with a member of his maid staff. Neesan is helping his ten-year-old stepson tell the love of his young life how he feels. Colin Firth just found out his girlfriend is cheating on him with his younger brother and moves to the country where he falls for a woman who does not speak a lick of English.At times the movie does feel a little rushed because of all the completely separate plots going on. At times it can get confusing and a lot of times viewers will be wondering why they haven't seen much of a certain characters in what feels like a long time.All the actors in this movie did a good job for how little screen time they had. Only a really talented group of actors could draw an audience into the characters and story as quick as that group did.Love Actually may not be completely realistic but it does what it aims for. It is a solid feel-good movie that does not make you cringe the entire film. This is not an artistically crafted love story, it's a simple movie meant to convey one simple idea; "love actually is all around."

I had expected from this film a relatively undistinguished, harmless little romantic comedy. What instead unfolded was two-plus hours of the most unremitting, insulting, film clichés imaginable.The film consists of nine simultaneously-running subplots. Each subplot manages to be absurdly implausible, yet predictable at every turn. Among the worst: One tracked a geeky fellow who was convinced that the way to turn his romantic life around was to impress American girls with his English accent. Each scene of that plot consisted of something like the following: "I'm going off to the US, where the chicks will think I'm a coolly sophisticated Brit!" (His friend): "You're crazy!""California girls here I come!" "Stop!" And so on.And on.In the "payoff" scene, at film's end, he does, in fact, bag three hot American girls in a bar. Why this scene was worth endless repetition along the way is a mystery.Another similarly repetitive plot involved two people performing together in a porn film. They strike up a conversation and start forming a tentative relationship. The "joke" is that these strangers are being sexually intimate, yet are acting like awkward teenagers as they stumble their way to going out on a date. They're porn stars, but they're shy! Isn't that funny? Ho ho ho! This might have an amusing one-five-minute-scene joke, but this film stretches into a film-long subplot, complete with the male rejoicing over getting a good-night kiss from his new love. Barf.Perhaps the worst one involved Colin Firth. Betrayed early in the film, he's heartbroken. He is assigned a non-English-speaking housekeeper, whom it takes exactly two seconds to discern will be his romantic salvation. This subplot builds to a supposedly climactic scene where he, with a big crowd in tow, descends upon a restaurant where she works, to propose marriage. He awkwardly declares his love, shots of all of the other diners looking confused and expectant, she says yes, then everyone breaks out in applause and there isn't a dry eye to be found. Argh. This film didn't even bother to construct a buildup to this climactic moment. The two characters have barely a few verbal exchanges prior to this scene. And the film uses all of the other clichés: her brusque Mediterranean father in the crowd, her sister egging her on, etc. None of these people were actually developed characters. They are just insulting stereotypes thrown in for the final set piece.In another subplot, Hugh Grant plays a newly elected British Prime Minister. He doesn't bother to act differently from the way he normally does, the same stammering, yet somehow debonair, Hugh Grant character that he always plays.He walks in off the street to 10 Downing, and is introduced to his staff, one of whom, again, can immediately be identified as his eventual love interest. Power Prime Minister falls for humble servant girl -- how romantic! Who would have thought?The Prime Minister's scenes seem to have scripted by a 10-year-old. It's hard to depict politics or diplomacy more childishly than most mainstream films do, but this film manages. Grant is shown meeting with his Cabinet, with dialogue along the lines of: "Mr. Prime Minister, you really need to get tough with those Americans." "No, I don't think I will. Like it or not, America is the most powerful country in the world, so I think we'll just have to be nice to them." Yes, it's about that sophisticated. But soon the evil Americans show up, led by Billy Bob Thornton, looking hickish and sinister, another example of the film's relentless caricaturing. There is soon a negotiating scene that goes something like: (Americans, haughtily): "We will be continuing the policies of the previous Administration." (Brits): "But they are bad policies!"But the Americans won't bend, so "bad" policies it will be. (Ah, the simple logic of film. Let's have good policies instead of bad ones -- Brilliant!)Later, when in private discussions with President Billy Bob, Grant steps out and returns to find the Prez nuzzling his housekeeper. So, the Americans are not only unreasonable negotiators but lechers, too! At the next press conference, Hugh's backbone stiffens, he emphatically declares that the Brits aren't going to be pushed around anymore.Cut to shots of applauding, grateful Brits, wiping tears from their eyes. No kidding.The writing is adolescent from start to finish. Supposedly about romance, it was about anything but: It was about how many times the writer/director could haul out the same tiresome, insulting, manipulative stereotypes and syrupy music.The film begins with shots of people embracing at airports. It's a clue. The writer likes the image of love, but isn't terribly interested in what goes into it.We have a new plague among screenwriters: Richard Curtis. He also gave us Four Weddings and a Funeral, which was similarly, though not quite as spectacularly, awful.Is it really the case that filmgoers will find such dreck droll and clever if only it is dressed up with a British accent? There seems to be no other explanation for this man continuing to be given financial backing.

This was a most intriguing film. There are of course other reviews of it here, but the one common theme that seems to exist in all reviews is the simple fact that you can never please all the people all of the time.For myself I loved the film and the way that all the stories were intertwined. You could spend ages just trying to work out where the various connections between the story lines actually were.But there were two very special moments for me in this film. One was where Mark (Andrew Lincoln) finally told Juliet(Keira Knightley ) how he REALLY felt about her, through the medium of the messages on the cards, (surely many of us have experienced that sort of unrequited love), the other was the brilliant brief speech given by the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) to the press conference at which the American President was present. (Both of these appear as quotes elsewhere on this site.) I felt that it was a very brave move on the part of the writer (Richard Curtis) to allow the Prime Minister in the film to state what so many ordinary British people are feeling about America and its politics right now. I also feel that we, the British, are finally beginning to move away from under the Hollywood shadow, and are starting once again to produce some really excellent films of our own. And for me, this film just underlines this fact. May this trend continue. Claire Rosemary Jane.

I just adore this movie. Every year I watch it multiple times at Christmas. So many stories all woven together seamlessly with highs and lows across the emotional spectrum.There's a nice mix of actors and they all fit their roles so nicely. The exploration of love and what it means to different people along with what it can cause us to do is all covered.Even having watched it so many times I still get lost in the different storylines and even forget some only to suddenly remember them part of the way through.If you haven't already seen it then do yourself a favour and watch it!---------

Any picture that can have me rooting for Rowan Atkinson (who I usually detest as Bean, actually) has to be very well-crafted for my part...Rowan was the Angel Of Conscience in the film he helped the son of the just-widowered Liam Neeson's character by pass Customs to pursue true love of a little school-mate who happened to be a fine young Afro-American girl(this was where love did not know Race... Color-Blind), but he did everything to make Alan Rickman as the publisher think twice before he effed up his marriage for a bit of materialistic fluff! (The gift-wrapping sequence in the department store was annoying, hilarious and Bean-esque all at the same time w/o conflicting.. Amazing!!)Bill Nighy as the old rocker who discovered platonic love was marvelous; Hugh Grant (brother of Rickman's wife in the flick) as the goofy good PM who effed up Billy Bob Thornton's "Bushy" prez was superb and I liked the girl from EastEnders as his love interest, it shows true love knows no class! Love knows no language was shown in Colin Firth's attraction to his Portuguese assistant when recovering from Romance betrayed - another aspect of love, actually...Kiera Knightley and her weird triangle was a great twist, I thought the white guy had a crush on her husband not her! Ten stories linked in the weirdest ways and showing that love is Universal! As for the tunes, they were sublime and it was weird to see Bill Nighy's send-up really did do well in the UK Xmas charts! The Power of Love, actually!

Britians handle the emotions very well. I love britian fun films and this is one of the category.good screenplay, not boring, no vengeance only love. And I love actually.

Excellent writing, ridiculously strong cast. Grab your favorite holiday drink & snack, put your feet up and prepare to be thoroughly entertained - superb stuff from writer director Richard Curtis.

Love Actually is an almost perfect comedy. It tells many different stories simultaneously and every single one of them is engaging and funny. Because of the multiple plots the spectator doesn't have time to get bored. The different scenarios are quite diverse and depict people of different ages, cultures, wealth. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that the spectator finds at least one of the stories relatable. Every character goes through ups and downs but the movie rewards us with a feel-good ending, which makes it a perfect Christmas and family movie. I truly believe that love actually is a benchmark for all comedies and Christmas movies out there.

I'm a pretty cynical person but this movie helps remind me of how important the live in my life is. I've watched it countless times and each time, it gets better. Family love, friendship love, partnership love makes this film so readily available to everyone. It hits in all the right spots from STELLAR acting to phenomenal writing and directing. My only gripe is the lack of diversity but the director and writer has even publicly agreed with that. The score is iconic, the plot is so loveable, the characters redeemably quaint. I honestly question people who dislike this film or haven't seen it in the 20 years it's existed.

Oftentimes, movies with intersecting storylines don't work well, and this is no exception. There are way too many storylines, and some of them just feel cliched beyond belief. If I had to cut any of them, one would definitely be the storyline with the caterer who tries to meet American girls.This movie unfortunately also suffers from another issue of movies of its type: romantic comedies usually suck when it comes to the comedy. The laughs are very rare in this movie, and they usually only occur in the Bill Nighy storyline. It makes sense why critics say he stole the show: his character is one of the few good things about this movie.Also the tagline of this being the ultimate romantic comedy? How pretentious. The tagline seems true if you want ultimate to mean average. I don't think that this movie should be a flat 6.0, but I definitely didn't want to give it a 7. To me it makes sense that IMDb's overall rating were something like 6.8.

Love Actually is a lot like actual love---it's wonderful until it isn't. Then everything blows up, leaving you to pick up the pieces of your devastated reality.Relax. I'm only kidding. Love really is wonderful, even the struggles. The movie Love Actually, not so much.The first 30 minutes or so are downright hilarious, featuring a mix of charming British humor and broader appeal jokes as well. The setup of each storyline features likable characters in relatable situations. You root for everything to work out. You want all of them to be happy.Then, through no fault of the characters, you change your attitude. Instead of rooting for the characters, you become apathetic, at best. Why? Because the movie makes every story nauseating with irritatingly manipulative music, cuts to closeups of hopeful or gleeful faces to force viewers to elicit the "hooray" emotions. It's all very painful and frustrating.The movie is called Love Actually (which is a great title, by the way), but so little of what occurs in the movie can be passed off as something that would actually happen. A more appropriate title would be Love Fantasy.Thirty minutes into the movie (again, the beginning shows promise and is mostly delightful), all the believable buildups have morphed into shameless fairy tale-like sequences. It's all a bunch of love at first sight silliness. Sorry if this sounds too harsh, but there is no love at first sight. The very concept is shallow and supposes a fundamental misunderstanding of what love is. There can be attraction at first sight, or lust at first sight. But not love.The most ghastly instance of using music to manipulate the viewers comes during a scene when two people, who have never spoken a word to each other because they don't speak the same language, develop feelings for each other. That is an interesting idea that could have been quite moving if handled deftly. Instead, the moment is a bit more blunt. The music indicates that the man develops loving feelings for the woman when she takes off all her clothes to jump in a lake. Viewers are led to believe that the man felt little for this woman until he saw that she looked good in her underwear, after which he fell in love with her.So, I guess the message is that you can love someone that you've never spoken to as long and the other person is attractive. It's basically a different version of that thing in movies when the dorky girl takes off her glasses then everyone realizes that she's beautiful and then the main guy character can love her now. The biggest difference between those two cases is that the dorky girl removing her glasses moment usually happens in a movie that clearly isn't taking itself too seriously, whereas Love Actually is posing as a movie that represents realistic love. That's sad to me because many viewers, especially the impressionable young ones, may walk away from this movie confusing attraction for love.Since I'm unleashing all my gripes with this movie, I may as well mention one more. This one didn't so much make me mad, as much as it confused me. It is also kind of funny in a way. I'm talking about the portrayal of the U.S. President (the movie takes place in England). It casts him as this arrogant, smug, woman harassing pig. Basically, he's a bully. So, when one of the British characters stands up to him, the music swoons once again, indicating to the audience that they should be happy that the American jerk couldn't push people around anymore.To be honest, I have no idea if this is the perception that people in England have of Americans. Perhaps it is, and the viewers from England really did applaud this moment. But I personally found it all to be laughably cheesy.That's a pretty accurate summary of my take on the movie overall---laughably cheesy. I'll just leave it at that. I recommend that you take a hard pass on Love Actually.

Like most guys I would never have seen this movie on my own or with male friends. However my girlfriend was in town and I thought a romantic comedy would make an ideal movie for us to see together.I had heard about the reference to 9/11 made at the beginning of the movie and was dreading having to sit through that part. However I was pleasantly surprised to note that the reference was very minor and not particularly cringe worthy either so I am not quite sure why it annoyed some people so much.As regards to the movie overall I quite enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it as an ideal date film. A lot of the reviews here have disparaged the movie because they thought it was too glib about love and very unrealistic. But I think you have to accept that the movie was made to make people laugh and bring the spirit of love into the Christmas holiday period. If you watch the film in that context then it does its job admirably well.However for me the best moment in the film was the press conference given (standing side by side) by the American president and the British Prime Minister. I actually felt like standing up and cheering when Hugh Grant (as the Prime Minister) finally tells the American president to his face and in front of the worlds press that Britain will no longer kowtow to American wishes but will have an independent view of its own.Considering that America is the biggest market for movies it was extremely brave of Richard Curtis to write this scene and he deserves a lot of credit for portraying the American president as rather loathsome and putting into context what the `Special Relationship' really is all about.As Richard Curtis must have known the movie had done okay but not great in the States. However it has cleaned up here in the UK and I'm sure will do very well in the rest of the world too.So Bravo Richard Curtis for standing up for your principals; you are a hero!
