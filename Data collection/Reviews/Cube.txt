"Where did Quentin come from? And how did he get through all the shifts and bony traps to meet the protagonists at the bridge?" Those were the questions I was asking myself at the end of Cube.The movie holds a brilliant premise and combines it with solid writing and acting for 87 of the 90 minute run-time. Then the last 3 minutes fall into the pit of regular horror movies with one guy chasing the others. He's an invincible genius too because he somehow gets past booby traps and the entire cube shifting to find the bridge at the end. It abandoned the cleverness of the rest of the movie. Would've been an 8 or 9/10, but instead will do with 7/10.

Great. Another shining example of how my inadequacy in mathematics could be the end of me. I used to skip math class. I took the bare minimum requirement expected of me and passed with something less than flying colours. The point is, math is all that separates our "heroes" from certain death in this arena."Cube" is an innovative little thriller that can safely dodge accusations of blandness or mediocrity. The premise is simple and the plight of the characters is highly relative despite its surrealistic science fiction setting. Six individuals find themselves trapped in a cube comprised of many rooms linked together, with no readily visible way out, no rations, tools or explanation for being there, with traps set up in some of the rooms. An apparent experiment on how people think and react to certain situations and the transformations they might undergo.The simplicity of the film and the cube itself are the film's strongest assets and can probably account for it's international success, notably in Japan. It's low budget production costs came under $400,000. But they got a really good bang for their buck with some help from special effects houses that provided their services free of charge. As the director has commented on the audio commentary track of the DVD, one aspect they were going for was a way to have an action flick in one room. They pulled it off quite nicely. Another interesting tidbit brought to light was that each character's name is after a prison.A curious aspect of this Canadian film was its surprisingly short run in Canadian cinemas. In speaking with one of the film's producers, Mehra Meh, I learned that despite it's award as "Best First Feature" at the Toronto Film Festival of 1997, the film run in Canada came a year later and was just for a few short weeks before it was yanked from theaters and then showcased internationally. When time came for the DVD release, I found another perplexing development. It was only available as an import. A Canadian film only available as an import in Canada? It wasn't until months later that it was released domestically.In any case, the film is available now and worth checking out if you have interest in the psychological thriller fare. Those who work their days or nights (or both) in a cubicle may wish to pass on this one, as it just might be too close to home.

Cube is a movie that explores human nature and our instinctive urges for survival vs our humanitarianism. Not a new concept, I know, however this movie does it in style, with a plot so simple that it could only be the work of a conceptual genius. I don't intend to give too much away, as the power of the film lies in it's mystery, but I will say that this movie could almost be classified as disturbing, not due to its content, but rather the thoughts that it instills in the audience. I found myself rather shaken as I left the cinema, feeling as though I had been exposed to an ugly, hidden side of humanity and society. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely worth seeing, I would even be so bold as to say that it must be seen! I must admit that there are few movies I have seen that have had such a profound affect on me, and I don't think I am alone in my feelings.

"Cube" is certainly a unique movie. The brilliant, absolutely irresistible premise grabs you instantly, and the production design keeps you impressed. The first hour of this picture was thoroughly engrossing and full of surprises; I would even call it "astonishing" if the actors didn't deliver some obviously forced, unnaturally "profound" speeches, and if the director didn't try to create dramatic moments by taking the easy way out - having the characters argue with each other all the time; if they acted as a team and tried to overlook their differences, THAT would have been the REALLY original approach. Still, the movie was fast-paced and fully engrossing.And then, about 20 minutes before the end, it begins to collapse! The mathematical calculations become IMPOSSIBLE to decipher and follow. A major character changes his behavior completely. And the ending is a real disappointment. Some people have said it's "surprising"; I think it's a total cop-out. It doesn't provide any explanations, and it doesn't provide any clues for us to try to figure it out on our own. I watched the last five minutes three times. They leave you with an intense "THAT'S IT?" feeling.Overall, this movie is definitely worth seeing, and the acting isn't nearly as bad as most people say, but be prepared for a HIGHLY unsatisfying ending. 6/10.

If you were to think about what situation would terrify you the most, Cube would be the ultimate challenge.  In a way, it is a predecessor to TV's "Survivor" in which the people each have a skill that can help them survive and possibly get them out.  It all comes down to human emotions and confrontations that get in the way of progress.  It's a talky film, but that's the point-- figuring situations and dealing with different personalities is inevitable to any group.  The solving of problems becomes very complex, but the viewer doesn't have to worry...let the characters figure it out as we go along for the ride.  While so many sci-fi films want to wow you with effects, this film does something more challenging--it makes you think.  With its limited budget and digital effects in use even before Titanic glorified them, Cube still proves itself as one of the more original and intelligent sci-fi films of the last decade, with a cult status already going strong. It is truly a nail-biter.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty tired of all these wanna-be horror movies that are out now. All of those movies are rated PG-13 and can't seem to scare anyone. But right at the verge of these so-called horror movies came Cube, a low-budget horror film with an original idea and a good idea of how to execute it. It could have gone belly-up, but it works for the most part and creates a suspenseful movie.A group of seven people find themselves trapped in some sort of maze of cubes. They're all different colors and to make matters more interesting, some are booby trapped. They have no recollection of how they got there, nor do they have a clue how to get out. It becomes a battle of wits to stay sane and survive.There's an overall sense of creepiness, doom, and claustrophobia that overshadows the whole movie, not to mention the paranoia that sinks into both the characters and you as you watch. You only know as much as the characters-you don't know how they got into the cubes, what they're for, or any of the typical exposition. And although most of the characters were annoying, it put you side by side with them, which helped a lot. If you get to be next to the characters, you can understand their actions more. However, you do (somewhat) find out what these cubes were made for, which kind of dampers the whole thing, but it's still very interesting to go through.But when the climax comes about, the movie descends into hokey B-horror land, with a terrorized killer stalking most of the people. When the original exploration of the cubes subsides and you get the people walking around, also, the interest starts to wane. It's often repetitive, but the booby traps are quite, for lack of a better word, fun. But that doesn't mean that the original creativity has gone away, it's just not as interesting. But I really liked Cube, and if you see it, you will too.My rating: 7/10Rated R for some strong sci-fi violence/gore and language.

SPOILER: Vincenzo Natali. Funny sounding name right? Well just a little funny. Keep that name in your mind though over the next few years. After this film the Cube, Natali's follow up was the superb Cypher. He seems to be a master of a difficult genre, Sci-Fi. In a genre that is primarily known for having a high pap ratio, the fact that Natali's first two features have been cult classic science fiction movies then bodes well for Sci-fi fanatics who will eagerly anticipate his next movie. The Cube is a superbly crafted low budget film. On a shoestring budget and a dangerously basic premise full of intrigue, the film succeeds because of imaginative effects and taut directions as well as a superbly written script, delving into the human psyche in such an extreme situation. The plot is basically thus: A group of strangers wake in a cube room. They don't know where they are or how they got there but they know they must find a way out. It also transpires that when they leave each room the enter another room that is virtually identical in look. There will perhaps be a different colour in the lighting. The must find their way out before they starve tp death or go nuts, but to add to their woes, it seems that some of the rooms are booby trapped, ranging from sound activated, to pressure activated traps. They soon discover that each of them has a specific gift that can perhaps hold the key to their escape. There is a maths genius who may hold the key to discovering a way out. The rooms are numbered and the numbers could signify the type of room but also a map. The film is excellent and just when they think they have figured it out the Cube bites them in the behind. The dynamic of the characters is excellent as inevitably some go crazy. I do think that for a film shot for less than 300,000 dollars this is amazing looking. It works well for a film that is set in the same environment for the 90 minutes of the film. I have to say this film is one of those pleasant surprises that comes from nowhere and when word of mouth finally gets to you, please listen! ****

Basically, this movie is exactly what the DVD box cover says: 6 people are trapped inside a maze/death-trap. They try to get out.It isn't really about the prison, though. It's about how people react to stress. And it's about the design of the prison.The basic premise reads like a Twilight-Zone episode. 6 people wake up in a series of interconnected rooms. Some of these rooms kill their occupants in various ways.Each person was placed there with a specific function in mind. One person is a cop, who has leadership qualities. One is a doctor, able to treat the wounded. One is a high-school student, who's math knowledge is still fresh in her mind. One is one of the people who built a component of the place, who brings unique knowledge of the prison. One is apparently autistic, able to perform complex math computations easily. One is an escape artist loner-type who gets himself killed early on to remind the audience that anyone can die.The prison acts as a personality-conflict engine, as it forces people to interact to save each other's lives and their own.It's a great premise, the interlocking prison that they have to figure out the secrets to. And, as with any human endeavor, dealing with each other becomes increasingly hard as dehydration and stress wear down their patience.The problem comes when one of them, quite suddenly, snaps and starts killing them. For no apparent reason.I understand that tensions were running high. But when the most likable and reasonable character in the entire movie starts going nuts and killing people for no apparent reason, it kinda sullies the character interactions.Granted, this was a problem with the dialog as a whole. People thrust into the situation seemed entirely too unwilling to tell each other things. I can understand panic. But after an hour in the death maze, when someone asks what skills you could contribute, I would expect people to give a full resume/CV including personal histories, not, "I'm a doctor, like 10 million others." There was a lot of confrontation in the movie, even at the beginning when dehydration and exhaustion hadn't set in yet. They just seemed to want to argue rather than attempt to reason a way out.Despite the ending and a degree of contravity with the dialog, the movie works reasonably well.

Interesting, suspenseful flick, with some great direction, hampered by terrible acting and atrocious dialogue. The overall concept is an intriguing one, and could have made for a better film in the hands of a competent writer, but instead the screenplay is filled with idiotic characters and ludicrous dialogue. Combined with some terrible overacting by most of the cast, and the dialogue-heavy scenes become painful to watch. Fortunately, the 'action' sequences redeem the film, as they are shot well and become incredibly suspenseful - especially the scene with the quiet room. Some great gore effects and a fitting ambiguous ending make it a worthwhile viewing.

Seven years before the release of "Saw" and decades before the Escape room movies came "Cube". A truly original idea at the time, but flawed by some of the worst acting I have seen from leading actors since Tommy Wiseau in "The Room" and an ending that made me wonder whether the writer had run out of ideas. It could have been so much better!

I get that it's a low budget movie and all, but the acting is so bad and irritating, that it makes the whole movie unlikeable.

"Cube" had one of the greatest ideas for a movie I've ever seen.  Right up there with "The Matrix".  But it was ruined!Don't read this if you haven't seen it.I loved the idea of people being trapped in this maze and not knowing why or how, superb idea.  Of course I don't know how one would react in such a situation, but why would this cop, a man who does good, go crazy and start killing and beating people for no apparent reason?  Kind of stupid if you ask me.  Also...as one of the other comments mentioned...how would this so-called cop get to the end of the maze on his own?  There is no way he could get anywhere without the girl genius or the autistic guy.  ...Ok, so let's assume that he does get to the end of the maze...why didn't Leavin and Worth hear the door opening when the "cop" came into the room?This movie went from a great sci-fi, mind-job movie to a retarded horror pointless story.Here's a question for the Director/Writer...Why on earth did you have these characters go through hell just to die at the brink of escaping?  What a let down!!!That's my two cents.  Thanks.

The Cube is one of those 'just on the verge of becoming a cult movie' titles that unfortunately doesn't quite stick the landing, but it'll leave you thinking of just "what even is the point.." to many things afterwards.Is it social commentary? Philosophical? Perhaps. But not obvious when watching it as it tries to entertain you.Content warning for body horror, although as a teen watching this on VHS, the effects are pretty awesome and not something you forget easily, heck, the Resident Evil movie that came not soon after this one even lifted one of the horrible ways someone can die - and hint hint, the title gives it away.8 is perhaps a high score, because while it is memorable and definitely worth watching for any true scifi fan, it is pretty hammy in most other aspects.

This is art. Plain and simple, art. This film reminds me of Memento, a very low-budge film that is better than 95% of the high-budge films out there. Why? Because it relies on the story and the quality of acting to make it great, not C.G.I. and overpaid mainstream actors. Not only is it a well presented thriller, it's also a study of the breakdown of human emotions and sanity when kept in solitude outside of one's comfort zone. The cube tests the characters' ability to function and work together in alien territory while in constant imminent danger. This is just a brilliant film made by a brilliant writer/director. This movie is a must for any lover of psychological thrillers. - Rob

Don't get me wrong the movie is nice, the idea is great and original but the ending is not very great.Over all the movie is a nice experience.

The entire situation is a simple allegory for life in a human society. If you're looking for a standard "let's play a game" horror flick filled with jump scares and gore, this isn't it.You'll spend 90 minutes with a bunch of "normal" people (i.e. humankind) that possess a variety of virtues and vices. The protagonists are trying to escape a big and seemingly pointless maze, full of boobytraps, dead ends and moving targets. Is this someone's sick joke? A grand conspiracy? Or just a product of other humans who only did their jobs one day at a time? The whole thing must have cost cubic dollars *ba dum-tsss*. Why were these people placed there? Because reasons. Otherwise the whole thing would be pointless, right? So keep moving. Or don't?I found the film both stimulating and entertaining, and I expect it be memorable. Give it a watch.

Rented this based on the strong (7.5) rating here at IMDb. As a rule I find ratings here are pretty accurate, but this one however is way off the mark. Several characters stuck in a cube, some obviously chosen for their particular ability, but others seem to have just been put there to make a story, then have them blunder from room to room for a while, watch how they interact a bit, then kill off most of them at the end.Performances across the board are OK so my real complaint is with the writers as they take us through the cube, nothing is ever resolved or explained - yeah, we get to hear that no one is currently in charge of the cube, but please, don't insult viewers by simply asking us to believe that this thing just magically got built with no conceivable purpose but to zap people! Then there's the ending - talk about lack of resolution. This was definitely a case of 'ok, we have enough film in the can, time to quit' - and that's exactly what they do. Had the writers spent some time and come up with a creative ending, it could have save this film and made it a true 7.5. But as is, I'd say take a pass unless it's the only thing available.

"Where did Quentin come from? And how did he get through all the shifts and bony traps to meet the protagonists at the bridge?" Those were the questions I was asking myself at the end of Cube.The movie holds a brilliant premise and combines it with solid writing and acting for 87 of the 90 minute run-time. Then the last 3 minutes fall into the pit of regular horror movies with one guy chasing the others. He's an invincible genius too because he somehow gets past booby traps and the entire cube shifting to find the bridge at the end. It abandoned the cleverness of the rest of the movie. Would've been an 8 or 9/10, but instead will do with 7/10.

It probably cost about half the budget of this movie, to make the opening sequence, which successfully gets your attention. Once it has your attention it simply refuses to let you go, it is compelling to say the least.The entire cast were pretty much unknown when the film was made (and most still are), but they all gave fine performances throughout. Without the successful casting this film could have easily been a disaster, as it is almost entirely character driven. I'm glad to say that definitely is not the case.Despite the low budget and practically unknown cast, the film manages to be clever, intriguing, thought-provoking and highly enjoyable. sadly, this film is probably a one off, i can't think of another low budget film that has half the impact of this one.8/10 and worth every point

Great. Another shining example of how my inadequacy in mathematics could be the end of me. I used to skip math class.

They just seemed to want to argue rather than attempt to reason a way out.Despite the ending and a degree of contravity with the dialog, the movie works reasonably well.

This film is one of the most original films I've ever seen.  On top of that, it is absolutely riveting and engaging.  It will have you thinking for hours afterward.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes intriguing movies. The acting is good.  Other than the girl who plays the student, I've never seen any of the actors before, which makes the movie much harder to predict than most.  The air of mystery prevails throughout.  The pace is perfect, which surprised me, given the limited amount the characters could actually do. And the ending doesn't sell out the rest of the movie, which films with this level of mystery often do.

Interesting, suspenseful flick, with some great direction, hampered by terrible acting and atrocious dialogue. The overall concept is an intriguing one, and could have made for a better film in the hands of a competent writer, but instead the screenplay is filled with idiotic characters and ludicrous dialogue. Combined with some terrible overacting by most of the cast, and the dialogue-heavy scenes become painful to watch. Fortunately, the 'action' sequences redeem the film, as they are shot well and become incredibly suspenseful - especially the scene with the quiet room. Some great gore effects and a fitting ambiguous ending make it a worthwhile viewing.

From what I can tell of the other online reviews for 'Cube,' it's one of those films that you'll either love or hate. Personally, I absolutely loved it from the first time I saw it and have subsequently seen it many times since. I guess I can understand people not really getting behind it. It's hardly a rollercoaster or a thrill ride with hordes of brilliantly computer-generated monsters ripping people apart. Although it is pretty horrific - you just have to think it through.Six strangers wake up inside, what is technically, one giant Rubik's Cube. However, this one doesn't just take half your life getting one piece of blue square out of an entire side of red - this one has lethal traps inside which can do anything from melt your face, to completely dicing you all together. How did they get there? They don't know. All they know is that there's no food or water on hand, therefore they better figure out how to get out of there before they starve to death (and so rob the traps of the honour of killing them).And that's about it. It's a simple (and highly condensed/claustrophobic) little tale with no real major set-pieces (the cube is technically the same one room, endlessly repeated - only in different colours), no recognisable stars, few special effects and - possibly most importantly - few (if any!) answers to the questions raised.Like I say, I personally love it. I find it as tense now as I did when I first watched it (even though I know what happens to everyone!). Yes, I know the lack of 'star-power' does actually mean that some of the actors deliver their lines a bit poorly, but I forgive it on account of the fact that it clearly doesn't have that much of a budget and yet it still was able to pull together something that is truly memorable.If you want something big budget and exciting, this is definitely not for you. However, if you're looking for something small, tense, creepy and downright scary if you think about putting yourself in any of the protagonists' situation and work out how you might survive in such a foreign situation, then definitely give this one a go. It's not a 'cult classic' for nothing.

Seven years before the release of "Saw" and decades before the Escape room movies came "Cube". A truly original idea at the time, but flawed by some of the worst acting I have seen from leading actors since Tommy Wiseau in "The Room" and an ending that made me wonder whether the writer had run out of ideas. It could have been so much better!

I get that it's a low budget movie and all, but the acting is so bad and irritating, that it makes the whole movie unlikeable.

"Cube" had one of the greatest ideas for a movie I've ever seen.  Right up there with "The Matrix".  But it was ruined!Don't read this if you haven't seen it.I loved the idea of people being trapped in this maze and not knowing why or how, superb idea.  Of course I don't know how one would react in such a situation, but why would this cop, a man who does good, go crazy and start killing and beating people for no apparent reason?  Kind of stupid if you ask me.  Also...as one of the other comments mentioned...how would this so-called cop get to the end of the maze on his own?  There is no way he could get anywhere without the girl genius or the autistic guy.  ...Ok, so let's assume that he does get to the end of the maze...why didn't Leavin and Worth hear the door opening when the "cop" came into the room?This movie went from a great sci-fi, mind-job movie to a retarded horror pointless story.Here's a question for the Director/Writer...Why on earth did you have these characters go through hell just to die at the brink of escaping?  What a let down!!!That's my two cents.  Thanks.

The Cube is one of those 'just on the verge of becoming a cult movie' titles that unfortunately doesn't quite stick the landing, but it'll leave you thinking of just "what even is the point.." to many things afterwards.Is it social commentary? Philosophical? Perhaps. But not obvious when watching it as it tries to entertain you.Content warning for body horror, although as a teen watching this on VHS, the effects are pretty awesome and not something you forget easily, heck, the Resident Evil movie that came not soon after this one even lifted one of the horrible ways someone can die - and hint hint, the title gives it away.8 is perhaps a high score, because while it is memorable and definitely worth watching for any true scifi fan, it is pretty hammy in most other aspects.

Alderson (Julian Richings) wakes up inside a cubic room with exits on all sides. He climbs into the next room and is killed by a trap. Policeman Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) climbs into a new cube and finds injured secretive Worth (David Hewlett) passed out. Then others join them. Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor. Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a fearful math whiz. Wrennes (Wayne Robson) is an ingenious escape artist. Nobody remembers how they got there. Leaven notices unique numbers in each cube. Wrennes gets killed. Then Leaven realizes only rooms with prime numbers are traps. They run into mentally challenged Kazan (Andrew Miller).It's such a great and simple Kafkaesque idea. There are minimal sets. The flashiness comes from the interactions. It's a good indie thriller. It's a bit pointless like the cube itself. There are some slow spots in the middle. I also wish the ending is more compelling. The numbers get more complicated and it gets harder to follow. It's still a nice little indie thriller.

This is art. Plain and simple, art. This film reminds me of Memento, a very low-budge film that is better than 95% of the high-budge films out there. Why? Because it relies on the story and the quality of acting to make it great, not C.G.I. and overpaid mainstream actors. Not only is it a well presented thriller, it's also a study of the breakdown of human emotions and sanity when kept in solitude outside of one's comfort zone. The cube tests the characters' ability to function and work together in alien territory while in constant imminent danger. This is just a brilliant film made by a brilliant writer/director. This movie is a must for any lover of psychological thrillers. - Rob

The whole idea of the Cube is such a great one, I love the concept of the room, the fact that it's a puzzle. Film making so much more creative back in the nineties, a time where films weren't just recycled stories.The characters aren't exactly what you'd call loveable, in all honesty apart from two you keep on hoping they'll just walk into a booby trapped cube.The main body of the story is good, it also has some nice tension, and some random events to keep you guessing, like new characters randomly dropping in.The ending sucked, all those crazed events, all those calculations, only to be let down by such a dreadful conclusion.It does perhaps feel a little dated, some of the effects are poor by today's standards, but considering it's from 1997, I'd recommend. 6/10

Five people (later six) wake up inside a giant cube with thousands of rooms inside which are cubes themselves. Some of these rooms are trapped, some are not. These people have no idea how they got there and none of them know each other but they all have a purpose and they must use these purposes to try and escape the giant maze before they die of dehydration.....or madness.This low-budget independent Canadian film is brilliant and a very captivating watch. It's a fairly simple concept but at the same time it is very complex and deep. All the characters are there for a reason and the reasons are fleshed out and believable. The idea of how the cube works is also fleshed out and you can tell the filmmakers really spent a lot of time exploring it. It all seems believable which is important for a movie like this.But the thing I really admire about the film is that the ending doesn't try to explain anything. It leaves everything up to you, you have to figure things out for yourself. The ending leaves a sense of dread and paranoia and is very effective. The traps are also very cool and some of the resulting gore is pretty nasty.4½/5

Don't get me wrong the movie is nice, the idea is great and original but the ending is not very great.Over all the movie is a nice experience.

This is a great example of SF writing that took it's small budget and did something with it. It's like an old Twilight Zone in color. And the effects shots are perfectly gruesome. I have rarely gone to a movie where the tone was set so well before the title is even shown. Kudos for this director and his actors and crew. Why this has not gotten a wide release is beyond me! I had to see it in New York City. The pay off could be "asss tro nomical". He he.

The entire situation is a simple allegory for life in a human society. If you're looking for a standard "let's play a game" horror flick filled with jump scares and gore, this isn't it.You'll spend 90 minutes with a bunch of "normal" people (i.e. humankind) that possess a variety of virtues and vices. The protagonists are trying to escape a big and seemingly pointless maze, full of boobytraps, dead ends and moving targets. Is this someone's sick joke? A grand conspiracy? Or just a product of other humans who only did their jobs one day at a time? The whole thing must have cost cubic dollars *ba dum-tsss*. Why were these people placed there? Because reasons. Otherwise the whole thing would be pointless, right? So keep moving. Or don't?I found the film both stimulating and entertaining, and I expect it be memorable. Give it a watch.

Rented this based on the strong (7.5) rating here at IMDb. As a rule I find ratings here are pretty accurate, but this one however is way off the mark. Several characters stuck in a cube, some obviously chosen for their particular ability, but others seem to have just been put there to make a story, then have them blunder from room to room for a while, watch how they interact a bit, then kill off most of them at the end.Performances across the board are OK so my real complaint is with the writers as they take us through the cube, nothing is ever resolved or explained - yeah, we get to hear that no one is currently in charge of the cube, but please, don't insult viewers by simply asking us to believe that this thing just magically got built with no conceivable purpose but to zap people! Then there's the ending - talk about lack of resolution. This was definitely a case of 'ok, we have enough film in the can, time to quit' - and that's exactly what they do. Had the writers spent some time and come up with a creative ending, it could have save this film and made it a true 7.5. But as is, I'd say take a pass unless it's the only thing available.
