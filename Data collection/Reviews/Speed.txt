An American action thriller; A story about an LAPD cop who tries to rescue civilians by boarding a moving city bus rigged to explode. There are breathtaking aerial shots, mind-boggling stunts, and camera positioning which puts the audience right at the centre of the action. The film won two Academy Awards for Sound production. Sandra Bullock gives very good support with a twinkle in her eye. Dennis Hopper is very well cast as the diabolical villain. Keanu Reeves gives a corny but commanding performance. It's a film which centres on action and stunts, foregoing character development or personality, but it's a terrific adventure and embodies the perils and thrills of speed.

Enough action sequences for three movies. Sandra Bullock has the cuteness controls set on HIGH, and Keanu Reeves plays it straight, a lot like his part in "Point Break". Dennis Hopper is, of course, one of the most believably creepy movie villains in the business today. (See him in "Blue Velvet") OK, there were some physical impossibilities in the film, but c'mon, most action films have them. (I've driven buses before, and they will not do many of the things in this movie.) This movie kept my eyes glued to the screen throughout. Grade: B+

Ah, the "die hard" scenario. Since the movie of the same title came out in '88, many directors have tried to recreate the tension and energy of the classic action film. The great idea of an location packed with innocent people that's been taken over by a villain(or a group of them), and a single good guy in the same place... the only chance of bringing the explosive situation to a reasonably good end. This film was an attempt at re-capturing that, and at making Keanu Reeves an action-star in the process. I'd say they succeeded more at the second... The Matrix Trilogy speaks in favor of that, I'd say. The plot is fair. The basic idea is actually pretty good. The pacing is intense... the movie hardly ever lets you take a breather. In fact, it almost reaches extreme amounts... becoming overwhelming, leaving the viewer exhausted rather than entertained. The acting is decent enough. The characters aren't terribly developed or fleshed out. The action is pretty cool, and well-filmed and edited. The clichés are sadly present; the cackling(!) villain, the damsel in distress who screeches more than the bus tires and the heroic (male) lead. The dialog has its moments, but much of it sounds too much like trying to be macho and cool. The one-liners vary, but it's hard to deny that the whole "pop quiz" bit is cool. All in all, a pretty cool(if overwhelming) action film that just doesn't really break any new ground. I recommend this to any fan of action, the actors involved and anyone interested in the basic idea. Just know that you may find yourself more exhausted than entertained by the end of it. 6/10

Generic? Yup, Contrived? Of course, Fun? Absolutely! A brilliant first time Watch I can't lie, Fantastic all round performances and brilliantly tense action sequences there's not much wrong with this piece of film here and I can't recommend it enough, the original (and best) of over the top action ala 'The fast and the furious' franchise it's totally worth a watch, nothing but fun!

I rewatched Speed yesterday and still really enjoyed it even though quite a few things sounded dated or cheesy. At the time it came out it was a huge hit because the main leads had really good chemistry, so it didn't matter if the acting or dialogue was cheesy. Adding the civilians to it and getting them involved in the drama made it feel more suspenseful and the tension never wavers in this film, so it goes by surprisingly quick. Don't watch it if you're expecting Oscar worthy performances, just a good action flick to keep you entertained for rainy Sat.

If ever there was a film I wished I had seen at the theater,this would be the one.It's a great combination of a well written story, great direction,and a great cast.It's one of those films that you want to like so much,and it does not disappoint.The only thing that bothered me about the film is perhaps is the insertion of ill timed corny remarks ("He lost his head"),and the ending could have been done better,but overall a great action film worth owning.

Los Angeles SWAT daredevil cops( Keaunu Reeves, Jeff Daniels ) commanded by their chief (Joe Morton ) taking on extreme terrorist ( a bomber well performed by Dennis Hooper)who wires first an elevator and after that a public bus where a handful of characters (Alan Ruck, Carlos Carrasco, among others) face certain death . If the bus's speed down 50, it explodes. The starring hops on board but the driver is wounded and a valiant passenger (Sandra Bullock) takes the wheel. Then the bus runs , bounds and flies.This mindless, interesting and ingenious film is packed with thrills, suspense, tension and lots of interminable action. Enjoyable relationship between two main characters, Reeves and Bullock, based on risked circumstances work out pretty well. Sandra Bullock steals the show as feisty passenger and Keanu Reeves is fine as brave, intrepid police. Witty argument that dispenses excitement as well as entertainment. Packs atmospheric cinematography using Steadicam or hand-held camera by Andrej Bartkowick. And stirring musical score fitting to action by Mark Mancina . The picture is stunningly and effectively realized in his firs-time as director by Jan De Bont, a successful cameraman (Basic Instict, Die Hard) and Paul Verhoveen's usual and occasionally director (Speed 2, Twister). It's followed by inferior sequel ¨Speed II¨ with similar technician and artistic crew , starred by Sandra Bullock, Jason Patrick, Temuera Morrison and Willem Dafoe. The film will appeal to Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock fans. Rating : Better than average, well worth seeing.

Pop quiz, hot-shot - what's the most exciting action movie you've ever seen with a bus in it?Right, the answer is "Speed" and if you've seen it then you'll have to agree that there is more action in this one movie than any ten generic action flicks that have been released in the last ten years.A trend-setter the likes of "Die Hard", "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Lethal Weapon", "Speed"'s premise is simple - a bus is wired by a madman (Dennis Hopper) to blow up if it drops below 50 MPH.  This is to give the cop (Keanu Reeves) who ruined his last effort a run for his money in trying to save the day.  In the ensuing efforts, a woman (Sandra Bullock) is recruited to drive the bus and keep it over 50 MPH at all times.And for as deceivingly simple as it is, "Speed" pulls out all the stops by making every scene a nail-biter (the bomb discovery, Keanu getting aboard the bus, Sandra driving over an incomplete gap in a highway, etc. - the list is endless) and all the main characters (and a few of the supporting ones) are about as smart as your average movie-goer and have enough of these kinds of movies to figure out what the other guy's move will be and act on it.  I LOOOOVE movies like that.Keanu is far more heroic in this movie than he has been before (and since); Jeff Daniels is born to play best pal and does so with good-nature; Sandra is a delight to watch as well as hear - she has a voice you literally can wrap yourself up in; Hopper adds to his nutso roles with some droll lines that sound all the spicier delivered Hopper-style.  Everyone is great and gives their all.The movie is all one long action set-piece, which is what the action fan expects when they plunk down their money then sit down with their popcorn. They get their money's worth here and then some.  "Speed" was obviously written by someone who loves action films as much as the action film fans that watch them.  Good match-up.Nine stars for "Speed", and let's hear it for the magic of surveillance cameras.

I can't understand anyone rating the film 10, neither 1. The plot is ridiculous but if you can suspend belief, makes for an enjoyable action packed film.

For some reason Speed seems to be above criticism. It doesn't deserve this regard. I've never liked this film, and for a long list of reasons. I remember clearly the summer of 1994 when it became a sleeper hit. 'Die Hard on a bus' they called it. Erm...no. More like 'The Poseidon Adventure on a bus'.Everybody knows the story by now, which is the sign of a high-concept idea. But I'm not captured by it. A bomb threat on a yuppie elevator ends with the bomber apparently blowing himself up in the parking lot. The LAPD cannot allow the yuppies to fall a breathtaking one-foot per second into the basement (it honestly moves at this 'speed' with none of them affected by zero-gravity). The bomber claims he invested 3 years into this plan, but overnight he conjures-up a better plan (all with just a single oppose-able thumb) in which a bus will blow up if it falls below 50 mph.Half-witted cop Jack Traven races to the rescue. But instead of blowing-out the bus's tires he simply yells at the driver to stop. He doesn't. Once on-board they barge through traffic jams, hard corners, magically jump over 50-foot gaps (launched by invisible ramps it seems), and argue among themselves. The passengers are an undynamic bunch of cardboard cut-outs (burly worker in hat, long-faced African woman, whiny old crone, unemployed bachelor, geeky tourist) who never once get our sympathies. Many of them don't even have any dialogue and just sit there as if the threat of being blown to smithereens is a daily occurrence. Also, if I were Jack Traven, I'd put a bullet in the head of that annoying Helen before she even got a chance to draw air into her lungs in order to make her first complaint.Directed by former cinematographer Jan De Bont (who is actually responsible for making Die Hard look as good as it does), it's a high-key movie (to the point of almost being sterile) with lots of destruction and well-choreographed action, but he has no idea how to direct actors or build character. Between the action scenes there are painful lulls which are not helped by the frequently awful dialogue and poor writing.Perhaps I should say poor re-writing. Though Graham Yost is the only credited writer the script was significantly re-written by Joss Whedon, who made many changes. Originally the bomber was revealed to be Jeff Daniels' character, but after Whedon created Howard Payne the character of Harry Temple became redundant by the end of the second act and he's needlessly killed off. Other elements of the original draft are fossilized into the story and give it an irregular flow. There are so many other contrivances and lazy explanations that I just can't forgive. Jack Traven realizes that there is a camera on the bus when Payne refers to Sandra Bullock as 'the wildcat', despite the fact that the ancient camera Payne has hooked up inside the vehicle has nowhere near enough resolution to make out the Wildcat logo on her jacket (which she is also leaning against).Keanu Reeves' acting is so bad it makes Seagal look like Olivier. Don't get me wrong, I like Keanu, but he's excruciatingly awful in this film. His puzzling facial expressions and just plain bizarre pronunciation of certain words gives Jack Traven (already an unlikeable character) a semi-retarded edge. I longed for Payne to get away with it.Apparently Vic Armstrong was up for directing this but the producers went for Jan De Bont because of his lengthy camera credits. The success of the film is purely down to star power and its high concept. It's nothing to do with De Bont's ability as a director (which is why he hasn't worked since 2003) and I know that Armstrong would have made a better movie, even if he was stuck with Keanu (who he worked with a year later on notorious flop Johnny Mnemonic ), who couldn't even act ill if he had the flu.Speed is not a good film. It's a badly-written early 90s relic. I just cannot even begin to understand the adoration its gathered over the years.

'Speed' has to be the ultimate action film, involving you in an intense experience from the opening credits until the smash-bang climax. Not only do Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock do top work, but Dennis Hopper makes the most compelling villain of the '90s.It all starts with a revenge-driven extortionist letting authorities know he has planted a bomb on a bus. The catch is it will explode if the bus is driven at less than fifty miles an hour. The script races along with non-stop action and surprise twists, without ever giving the audience time to stop for breath. It's a little too intense for its own good and could have used some lighter moments to give us a break!Taut and suspenseful, with excellent effects and gripping suspense that keeps you riveted. Some of the stunts seem too incredible to be believable but in a film of this kind you have to go with the flow. The stunt work itself is breathtaking and makes it easy to see why the film is one of the most highly rated action films of the '90s.

This aged just a bit better than I'd remembered, although admittedly I didn't have the fondest recollections of it. In essence it's a nonstop barrage of action clichés that doesn't try to step out of its own way, choosing instead to embrace the stereotypes and come up with a few new ones along the way. Keanu Reeves appears at his most wooden while Sandra Bullock is still finding her sea legs as an actress, but the two still manage some level of incalculable chemistry that makes you pull for them through thick and thin. In many ways, their relationship is a great analogy for the film as a whole - generic and ham-fisted, you've seen it a thousand times before but for some inexplicable reason you're still perched on the edge of your seat for the duration. Dennis Hopper is noteworthy as the preposterously over-the-top mad bomber; he serves up several great lines that sent me backwards through decades' worth of pop culture nostalgia.

Pop quiz...There's a space on your DVD or Video rack.  What do you do? What do you do?Beat the rush hour, run the red lights, stay above 50mph and make your way to your nearest video supplier to buy or rent Speed.This film is a definite MUST for those people who enjoy a good Action Thriller type film (and maybe even for those who don't).I have a lot of love for Speed and no matter how many times I see it; it STILL continues to deliver non-stop action and incredible stunts & special effects.  Jan de Bont did a fantastic job directing this and I can't believe that the same guy who made this also made such a dire sequel like Cruise Control (but that's another story).Keanu Reeves once more proves what a great actor he is and that he is well suited for these types of movies.  Speed also helped launch Sandra Bullock's career.  Dennis Hopper's portrayal of Howard Payne is fantastic and Speed is a worth addition to his already impressive CV of films.  He makes a great villain.The main three stars of Reeves, Bullock, & Hopper is strongly supported by Joe Morton (Terminator 2) and Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber) and it's also nice to see supporting actors actually doing something.I am proud to say that Speed has a place on my DVD rack.  A rack that won't be getting its space used up by Cruise Control (Special Edition or not!)I have so many more positive things to say about this film and I think I said most of them in my User Comments for Cruise Control in which I compared that film with this.  There's NO comparison.  I think I all but destroyed Cruise Control with my comments leaving Speed as the clear winner.  Speed most definitely stays above 50mph.My vote:  10/10

This movie started of bad for me. A lot of cheesy lines and banter between Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves. I was worried that it would be a film that either didn't live up to the hype or wasn't as good as everyone has said. Luckily it picks up once the bus is introduced and it feels like it becomes a completely different and well executed film. The cheesy lines are still in there but they're not as bad once you're pulled into the tension and action. Well except for the "lost his head" remark near them end. Had a lot of fun watching it and is a film I can see myself stopping and watching again if I were to see it on tv.

Speed was a revelation to me . All of a sudden I was on the edge of my seat pulling for the hero. Up until that time I always knew the guy with muscles was going to win no matter what. But Keanu made me want him to win , he got me involved with the story. He did the same in Matrix. The hero is once again exciting.

Sheer adrenalin from beginning to end, Speed is one hell of an action film, but it is one that is both simple, yet deviously complex. First of all, the plot is well done. It really is. It sound good on paper and writer Graham Yost (with a little help from Joss Whedon) takes full advantage of what might happen when stuck on a bus that has to stay above fifty miles per hour in order to stop from blowing up due to a mad bomber. Every obstacle that Keanu and Sandra could possibly face arises; children crossing the road, a woman with a baby carriage, a traffic jam, a hard right turn and of course, a big huge gap on the road. Logic is not only stretched, but it is thrown out of a very high window, but when a film is this much fun why complain.The script is very well set up, not only in terms of plot but in terms of structure. Each act has it's own set piece. Act one features the elevator sequence. Act two, the biggest act of the film takes place on the bus while the third and final act takes place on the train (a controversial contribution from Whedon and one that Yost was very unhappy with). Of course none of this would work without a great director at the helm and Jan de Bont rises to the challenge. While his career after this has been hit and miss (critics have slated his work but audiences have been forthcoming), here he shows that he has learned from being a director of photography for Paul Verhoeven and John McTiernan with a visual prowess and a handling of action sequences that is superb. In fact a lot of the film recalls Die Hard with the suspense arising from a plot that is quite simple yet deviously more complex in its execution. The biggest surprise at the time was that Keanu Reeves does wonderfully well in the role of the hero, Jack Tavern. He is charming, yet tough and while he doesn't really have to 'act' here, his performance is well done and he should be proud. Likewise Sandra Bullock in what is really her breakthrough role, even though it is her second major film after having been the female lead in Demolition Man. Her performance has all the hallmarks of her lovely girl next door act and her chemistry with Reeves works well. It is especially funny when he keeps calling her 'mam'.However the film is stolen from everyone's favorite psychopath Dennis Hopper. Brilliantly evil as Howard Payne, Hopper clearly enjoys playing a bad guy who enjoy being a terrorist ("the whim of a mad man, I like it"). While the role is not of the disturbing variety that Frank Booth is (this is a mainstream film after all), the role is great one and is instantly memorable, as is his death scene.If you have still to watch this film do. It is brilliant and is one of the best Hollywood action films of the nineties. Just don't watch the abysmal sequel.

A SWAT officer in Los Angeles (Keanu Reeves) tries to save the lives of people on a bus from a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) who has the vehicle rigged to blow up if it goes under 50 MPH. Sandra Bullock plays a passenger on the bus while Jeff Daniels is on hand as another SWAT officer."Speed" (1994) is a disaster/action movie that delivers the goods as a thrilling popcorn flick. While it's not great like "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991) it's arguably on par with "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" (1995).Although a top-of-the-line production, it lacks the human interest of "Terminator 2" and "Runaway Train" (1985) and the story is unbelievably contrived. But, if you can roll with it, it's a dynamic blockbuster, just kinda forgettable in the grand scheme of things.The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area, including Mojave Airport.GRADE: B-

Speed is one of my favorite action movies of all time, just a notch below contemporaries like Terminator 2 and Die Hard. The premise is so simple that it's almost a parody of movie pitches (Homer Simpson's line was "I saw this movie about a bus that had to SPEED around a city, keeping its SPEED over fifty, and if its SPEED dropped, it would explode! I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'."). Fortunately this film came to be much better than the sum of its parts, and it's deservedly remembered as one of the most entertaining films of the 90s.What distinguishes Speed is its humanity, due in no small part to the character of Annie (Sandra Bullock). The best example of this is the moment when Annie, while driving the bus, thinks she has struck a baby stroller. She becomes so distraught that she lets go of the steering wheel, never mind the fact that she is in charge of driving a bomb-laden bus through the L.A. suburbs. It's one of several moments that draw us into the film by helping us identify with the characters, and it's all the more elegant for its simplicity. This movie isn't complex, but it doesn't claim to be.There is a certain irony that Speed succeeds so well on a human level, since Jan de Bont is not generally considered an "actor's director". He started as a cinematographer, and even when he talks about directing he discusses technical aspects and seldom mentions working with actors. Nowhere was this more evident than Speed 2, which pretty much killed his directorial career. Given that, it's all the more remarkable what he pulled off in the original Speed, as everything seemed to come together for him.The overall performances really serve this picture well. Keanu is at his best (which is to say, mediocre), Sandra launched a career based on this movie, and Dennis Hopper did a wonderful job as the sardonic villain. Plus he has one of my favorite bad-guy lines of all time (Traven: "You're crazy." Payne: "Poor people are crazy, Jack. I'm eccentric.").8/10

Even if you didn't experience the joy of 90-s culture in your own life, you can notice it in the music and movies. That being said, this movie is a true testament to that. Featuring young Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock ( this was her breakthrough role, and some people even today view her through this role) on a bus that can't drop below 50 miles per hour, or it will explode, you have a great concept. What you get from that concept is a 1 hour of pure action and that 90-s movie chemistry between the characters (especially between Keanu and Sandra) followed by negotiations with the bomber. It's a real blast (no pun intended) from the past, and with that said, you can easily overlook it's little flaws and unrealistic scenes. It's such a joy to watch and fills your heart with warmness, so it should be appreciated for that. Not a lot of movies today pull that off. 8.5/10 from me, and a warm recommendation! Enjoy! :D ;)

"Speed" was a runaway success in 1994.  It was a block-buster in every sense of the word and critically speaking, it is an excellent motion picture.  The film deals with an LAPD swat officer (Keanu Reeves) who is playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with crazed ex-cop Dennis Hopper.  After Reeves stops Hopper from blowing up a high-rise building, the next obstacle is a city bus.  Hopper has rigged the bus to explode if the "speed" ever drops below 50 miles per hour.  Sandra Bullock, in her star-making role, plays an unlucky passenger who becomes the center of attention when she is forced to be the driver when the original navigator is accidently shot.  The great thing about "Speed" is the fact that it never tries to be more than it is. It goes for non-stop action, thrills, chills, and spills.  However, Dennis Hopper's character is somewhat complex and his performance probably should have garnered him an Oscar nomination.  A great film in spite of the fact it is from the action genre.  5 stars out of 5.

Enough action sequences for three movies. Sandra Bullock has the cuteness controls set on HIGH, and Keanu Reeves plays it straight, a lot like his part in "Point Break".

Speed (1994) is one of the best action movie ever made!!!! It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves action movies. I just wish they wouldn't made sequel because it doesn't even compare to the first one. Speed 2: Cruise Control can't hold a candle to this movie. For me the sequel never happened. I only own this movie in Blu-ray collection and that is all. I love the theme score in the beginning of the movie and I love music at end of credits. I just love this movie, alongside with The Matrix, Johnny Mnemonic and Point Break is one of my favorite action film of Keanu Reeves. This movie is one of those films that is worth of watch and money. It seems like now this days, action films force themselves into a wickedly strange plot to try to be the next sixth sense and put more money into each explosion than into any actors. This is a film that you just love everybody in the movie because the acting is great as well as the original story line. Sure, its no Oscar winning type of film, but if your at home looking for a fun film to watch, SPEED is the right movie for you. Keanu Reeves & Sandra Bullock's chemistry really made this movie work. This movies Is a badass! It is directed by Jan de Bont the same director who directed the god awful sequel. This movie is just great, it is Die Hard on a bus. Speed is simply similar to other sequel movie like are Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) that come out one year later, when Sandra was handcuffed on the train and Keanu was saving her, the same cuffing scene was later used in Die Hard With A Vengeance. McClane been on a train that explodes and goes off the barrels out of an incomplete stretch of track and crashes, the same scene was used from this movie. Die Hard With A vengeance borrowed out some scenes from this movie including China Town line. I still love both of these movies, they are both great action films of the 90's and one of my all time favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Speed is a classic in modern terms and one of Keanu Reeves best performances. This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene. One of the iconic movies of the 1990's, Speed is a highly entertaining, slick and polished action movie. It's a benchmark movie of its genre that was high in tension and excitement without the unruly gore of a 1980's action flick. The story itself is very good; it has some important depth to it that missing from most action movies. The cast is rock solid; Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast as Jack Traven, a smart, agile but reckless police officer with a tendency to disobey orders and creates inventive solutions to get the job done. Jeff Daniels plays the sympathetic, wise polar opposite partner, Harry Temple, well. Dennis Hopper chews the scenes excellently as the charismatic and twisted maniac of villain. Sandra Bullock Annie couldn't be more likable and innocent. Joe Morton's character as the Chief is lively enough to support the lead and the rest of the cast is definitely solid.The movie is a near perfect one for me. It's like a minor terrorist who knows the police force and knows how to work w/ bombs which is really cool. Not only that Keanu Reeves makes an awesome cop and they have a great cast and supporting cast. Dennis Hopper makes a great villain, Sandra makes a great tough girl, and Jeff makes a great partner. I love the plot and the length of the movie. First starting off with a bomb on an elevator and then on a bus. And since it revolves around the bus ride the entire time they do a good job with adding little problems they must overcome to ensure the bus does not explode, such as sharp turns and getting on an unfinished bridge so they can stay over 50 mph.Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), an LAPD cop on SWAT detail, has a fearless nature and a keen understanding of the criminal mind. That, and some luck have kept him alive. But Jack's luck is being put to the ultimate test. An elusive bomber-extortionist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) is seeking vengeance after his latest ransom scheme is thwarted. Payne gives a personal challenge to Jack: A bomb is rigged on a city bus, which will detonate if the speedometer drops below 50 MPH. Poor Annie (Sandra Bullock) gets shoved into the driver's seat, while Jack does his best to save the day.That is the basic plot, it is a slick film about a young cop who must prevent a bomb exploding aboard on a city bus by keeping its speed above 50 mph. and stop a terrorist by executing his plan. I am giving this movie a 10/10 it hell deserves it! I have fun watching it and I still love the score of the films. Great solid action flick of Keanu Reeves I love it!

Ah, the "die hard" scenario. Since the movie of the same title came out in '88, many directors have tried to recreate the tension and energy of the classic action film. The great idea of an location packed with innocent people that's been taken over by a villain(or a group of them), and a single good guy in the same place... the only chance of bringing the explosive situation to a reasonably good end. This film was an attempt at re-capturing that, and at making Keanu Reeves an action-star in the process. I'd say they succeeded more at the second... The Matrix Trilogy speaks in favor of that, I'd say. The plot is fair. The basic idea is actually pretty good. The pacing is intense... the movie hardly ever lets you take a breather. In fact, it almost reaches extreme amounts... becoming overwhelming, leaving the viewer exhausted rather than entertained. The acting is decent enough. The characters aren't terribly developed or fleshed out. The action is pretty cool, and well-filmed and edited. The clichés are sadly present; the cackling(!) villain, the damsel in distress who screeches more than the bus tires and the heroic (male) lead. The dialog has its moments, but much of it sounds too much like trying to be macho and cool. The one-liners vary, but it's hard to deny that the whole "pop quiz" bit is cool. All in all, a pretty cool(if overwhelming) action film that just doesn't really break any new ground. I recommend this to any fan of action, the actors involved and anyone interested in the basic idea. Just know that you may find yourself more exhausted than entertained by the end of it. 6/10

Pop quiz, hot-shot - what's the most exciting action movie you've ever seen with a bus in it?Right, the answer is "Speed" and if you've seen it then you'll have to agree that there is more action in this one movie than any ten generic action flicks that have been released in the last ten years.A trend-setter the likes of "Die Hard", "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Lethal Weapon", "Speed"'s premise is simple - a bus is wired by a madman (Dennis Hopper) to blow up if it drops below 50 MPH.  This is to give the cop (Keanu Reeves) who ruined his last effort a run for his money in trying to save the day.  In the ensuing efforts, a woman (Sandra Bullock) is recruited to drive the bus and keep it over 50 MPH at all times.And for as deceivingly simple as it is, "Speed" pulls out all the stops by making every scene a nail-biter (the bomb discovery, Keanu getting aboard the bus, Sandra driving over an incomplete gap in a highway, etc. - the list is endless) and all the main characters (and a few of the supporting ones) are about as smart as your average movie-goer and have enough of these kinds of movies to figure out what the other guy's move will be and act on it.  I LOOOOVE movies like that.Keanu is far more heroic in this movie than he has been before (and since); Jeff Daniels is born to play best pal and does so with good-nature; Sandra is a delight to watch as well as hear - she has a voice you literally can wrap yourself up in; Hopper adds to his nutso roles with some droll lines that sound all the spicier delivered Hopper-style.  Everyone is great and gives their all.The movie is all one long action set-piece, which is what the action fan expects when they plunk down their money then sit down with their popcorn. They get their money's worth here and then some.  "Speed" was obviously written by someone who loves action films as much as the action film fans that watch them.  Good match-up.Nine stars for "Speed", and let's hear it for the magic of surveillance cameras.

This aged just a bit better than I'd remembered, although admittedly I didn't have the fondest recollections of it. In essence it's a nonstop barrage of action clichés that doesn't try to step out of its own way, choosing instead to embrace the stereotypes and come up with a few new ones along the way. Keanu Reeves appears at his most wooden while Sandra Bullock is still finding her sea legs as an actress, but the two still manage some level of incalculable chemistry that makes you pull for them through thick and thin. In many ways, their relationship is a great analogy for the film as a whole - generic and ham-fisted, you've seen it a thousand times before but for some inexplicable reason you're still perched on the edge of your seat for the duration. Dennis Hopper is noteworthy as the preposterously over-the-top mad bomber; he serves up several great lines that sent me backwards through decades' worth of pop culture nostalgia.

For some reason Speed seems to be above criticism. It doesn't deserve this regard. I've never liked this film, and for a long list of reasons. I remember clearly the summer of 1994 when it became a sleeper hit. 'Die Hard on a bus' they called it. Erm...no. More like 'The Poseidon Adventure on a bus'.Everybody knows the story by now, which is the sign of a high-concept idea. But I'm not captured by it. A bomb threat on a yuppie elevator ends with the bomber apparently blowing himself up in the parking lot. The LAPD cannot allow the yuppies to fall a breathtaking one-foot per second into the basement (it honestly moves at this 'speed' with none of them affected by zero-gravity). The bomber claims he invested 3 years into this plan, but overnight he conjures-up a better plan (all with just a single oppose-able thumb) in which a bus will blow up if it falls below 50 mph.Half-witted cop Jack Traven races to the rescue. But instead of blowing-out the bus's tires he simply yells at the driver to stop. He doesn't. Once on-board they barge through traffic jams, hard corners, magically jump over 50-foot gaps (launched by invisible ramps it seems), and argue among themselves. The passengers are an undynamic bunch of cardboard cut-outs (burly worker in hat, long-faced African woman, whiny old crone, unemployed bachelor, geeky tourist) who never once get our sympathies. Many of them don't even have any dialogue and just sit there as if the threat of being blown to smithereens is a daily occurrence. Also, if I were Jack Traven, I'd put a bullet in the head of that annoying Helen before she even got a chance to draw air into her lungs in order to make her first complaint.Directed by former cinematographer Jan De Bont (who is actually responsible for making Die Hard look as good as it does), it's a high-key movie (to the point of almost being sterile) with lots of destruction and well-choreographed action, but he has no idea how to direct actors or build character. Between the action scenes there are painful lulls which are not helped by the frequently awful dialogue and poor writing.Perhaps I should say poor re-writing. Though Graham Yost is the only credited writer the script was significantly re-written by Joss Whedon, who made many changes. Originally the bomber was revealed to be Jeff Daniels' character, but after Whedon created Howard Payne the character of Harry Temple became redundant by the end of the second act and he's needlessly killed off. Other elements of the original draft are fossilized into the story and give it an irregular flow. There are so many other contrivances and lazy explanations that I just can't forgive. Jack Traven realizes that there is a camera on the bus when Payne refers to Sandra Bullock as 'the wildcat', despite the fact that the ancient camera Payne has hooked up inside the vehicle has nowhere near enough resolution to make out the Wildcat logo on her jacket (which she is also leaning against).Keanu Reeves' acting is so bad it makes Seagal look like Olivier. Don't get me wrong, I like Keanu, but he's excruciatingly awful in this film. His puzzling facial expressions and just plain bizarre pronunciation of certain words gives Jack Traven (already an unlikeable character) a semi-retarded edge. I longed for Payne to get away with it.Apparently Vic Armstrong was up for directing this but the producers went for Jan De Bont because of his lengthy camera credits. The success of the film is purely down to star power and its high concept. It's nothing to do with De Bont's ability as a director (which is why he hasn't worked since 2003) and I know that Armstrong would have made a better movie, even if he was stuck with Keanu (who he worked with a year later on notorious flop Johnny Mnemonic ), who couldn't even act ill if he had the flu.Speed is not a good film. It's a badly-written early 90s relic. I just cannot even begin to understand the adoration its gathered over the years.

'Speed' has to be the ultimate action film, involving you in an intense experience from the opening credits until the smash-bang climax. Not only do Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock do top work, but Dennis Hopper makes the most compelling villain of the '90s.It all starts with a revenge-driven extortionist letting authorities know he has planted a bomb on a bus. The catch is it will explode if the bus is driven at less than fifty miles an hour. The script races along with non-stop action and surprise twists, without ever giving the audience time to stop for breath. It's a little too intense for its own good and could have used some lighter moments to give us a break!Taut and suspenseful, with excellent effects and gripping suspense that keeps you riveted. Some of the stunts seem too incredible to be believable but in a film of this kind you have to go with the flow. The stunt work itself is breathtaking and makes it easy to see why the film is one of the most highly rated action films of the '90s.

I can't understand anyone rating the film 10, neither 1. The plot is ridiculous but if you can suspend belief, makes for an enjoyable action packed film.

Pop quiz...There's a space on your DVD or Video rack.  What do you do? What do you do?Beat the rush hour, run the red lights, stay above 50mph and make your way to your nearest video supplier to buy or rent Speed.This film is a definite MUST for those people who enjoy a good Action Thriller type film (and maybe even for those who don't).I have a lot of love for Speed and no matter how many times I see it; it STILL continues to deliver non-stop action and incredible stunts & special effects.  Jan de Bont did a fantastic job directing this and I can't believe that the same guy who made this also made such a dire sequel like Cruise Control (but that's another story).Keanu Reeves once more proves what a great actor he is and that he is well suited for these types of movies.  Speed also helped launch Sandra Bullock's career.  Dennis Hopper's portrayal of Howard Payne is fantastic and Speed is a worth addition to his already impressive CV of films.  He makes a great villain.The main three stars of Reeves, Bullock, & Hopper is strongly supported by Joe Morton (Terminator 2) and Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber) and it's also nice to see supporting actors actually doing something.I am proud to say that Speed has a place on my DVD rack.  A rack that won't be getting its space used up by Cruise Control (Special Edition or not!)I have so many more positive things to say about this film and I think I said most of them in my User Comments for Cruise Control in which I compared that film with this.  There's NO comparison.  I think I all but destroyed Cruise Control with my comments leaving Speed as the clear winner.  Speed most definitely stays above 50mph.My vote:  10/10

Ahhh Speed. Always referenced, copied, but never bettered. There's a lot good about this film. Keane Reeves is a damn badass, great cop and great hero. I love Keanu Reeves acting, he does what he does very well.The films action scenes are top, the setting is u ique and although ridiculous is always taken seriously and believable in its own way. The action scene to start the film. Is great, the one to end it less so. Sandra Bullock is on peak form and so is the supporting cast, and a very evil Dennis Hopper.The bad - the last action scene wasn't needed. And the dialogue is so bad. The ending of the film, the last couple of lines are so bad, you have to either think the writers ran out of ideas, they genuinely were trying to be funny, or... something more subversive. Saving that it's a fun couple of hours.

Speed was a revelation to me . All of a sudden I was on the edge of my seat pulling for the hero. Up until that time I always knew the guy with muscles was going to win no matter what. But Keanu made me want him to win , he got me involved with the story. He did the same in Matrix. The hero is once again exciting.

I avoided seeing this film for years because it sounded so stupid. After seeing it can you only wonder: How did they make such a good movie from such a ridiculous premise?The characters are great, the dialog is fun, the action is perfect. The only bad thing is that entire final scenes should have been cut. It is once again a case of a movie that comes to the point where it could end perfectly, and instead the characters are drawn into 20 extra minutes of unnecessary action.Despite, a fun film that doesn't require much thinking. A guilty pleasure, perfect for a Friday night with popcorn.

One of the most explosive and epic action films is Speed! It stars Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton,Jeff Daniels, and Glenn Plummer! Reeves is really good. I like how his character is. Dennis Hopper is excellent! He's funny, he's mean, and he means business! Hopper was perfect in My opinion! Bullock was also very good. Plummer was also is funny and Morton and Daniels also perform good. The action is really great and you never know what to expect. The music by Mark Mancina is good and the direction by Jan de Bont is very good. I think that Speed is an excellent film which is always exciting! If you like the cast mentioned above and want to see Dennis Hopper in a great performance then I strongly recommend that you watch or even buy Speed today!

A simple rule for action movies, especially of the Western variety: the more explosions the better. Everyone likes a good explosion and nothing draws the audience's attention from wandering more than a loud, colorful boom. This is most likely why action films have cars or buildings blow up for no obvious reason. A car crunches into another, boom. A car flips, boom. A car is shot, boom. It's a trope that has caused me to scratch my head many a time. But to take the majority of action cinema seriously is to miss the point. Heavily criticizing the cinematography or technical aspects of Commando would be a pointlessly stupid endeavor that would beg the question of why you wasted your time. The production knew they weren't making an Oscar worthy film, they were making entertainment.Speed is entertainment, pure and simple. It's a film in three acts, all of which involve a means of transportation, with no fluff buffering the main sequences. We go quickly from being trapped on an elevator to the iconic bus scenes to the finale on a subway train. Who Keanu Reeves's character, Jack, is doesn't matter. We don't need to see him at home preparing for work or enjoying dinner with his fellow police officers. We are immediately introduced to the threat, an elevator full of people being held for ransom by a remote bomber, and the heroes, Jack and Harry, sent to save them. Everything we need to know about these two is told through action and organic dialogue. It's not enough to really flesh the characters out, but that's not the point. The point of the sequence is the end goal and the process of achieving said goal. How will Jack and Harry get these folks off the elevator and diffuse the bomb? The introduction of the villain, Howard, is another simplistic approach. He kills a guy and we know he's evil. Through the course of the movie we never exactly understand his full motives for what he's doing (money sure, but some movies would opt to elaborate) nor is he a particularly memorable baddie. He's the catalyst for what makes Speed memorable: the action sequences.The elevator is a well executed scene but the true meat is in the bus sequence, introducing Sandra Bullock's character of Annie. Again, no real introduction, just organic storytelling. She boards a bus that has a bomb on it. Once the bus hits fifty miles an hour, it has to keep going over fifty or it'll explode. Jack learns of this plot directly from Howard and thus begins one of action cinema's most iconic rescues.There's not a lot to say about it from a technical perspective. Speed is a well-directed affair and there's nothing awkward or bad to complain about. New obstacles are constantly thrown at the bus, almost to a comedic level. A woman with a baby stroller crosses the street in front of the bus, children cross, and eventually the overpass the bus gets on is incomplete, forcing a James Bond worthy flight over a fifty foot gap. None of this will wow you nor is it truly anything unique, but the rapidity of the obstacles combined with the tight direction and confident performances from Reeves and Bullock lead to an entertaining hour of high speed thrills.The finale is pretty predictable at first (heck, the whole movie is formulaic to be honest). Bad guy disguises as good guys, takes an unsuspecting Annie hostage, and forces Jack into a final confrontation on a subway. Like the elevator, this is a good sequence but not memorable. We want to see the villain get his come-uppance and we want Jack and Annie to get together. And both happen with enough of the prerequisite destruction of property that you'll be glued.So the question becomes: as formulaic as Speed is, as basic as the characters are, what makes it so good? The answer: everything stated above. It's a pure adrenaline rush film that's well-made and executed despite the shallowness. It's not a piece of art by any means and doesn't try to be. There are constant explosions, moments of excitement, and edge of your seat situations.It's a film that begs of you to sit back, shut off your brain, and enjoy the ride.And that ride is well worth taking.

Sheer adrenalin from beginning to end, Speed is one hell of an action film, but it is one that is both simple, yet deviously complex. First of all, the plot is well done. It really is. It sound good on paper and writer Graham Yost (with a little help from Joss Whedon) takes full advantage of what might happen when stuck on a bus that has to stay above fifty miles per hour in order to stop from blowing up due to a mad bomber. Every obstacle that Keanu and Sandra could possibly face arises; children crossing the road, a woman with a baby carriage, a traffic jam, a hard right turn and of course, a big huge gap on the road. Logic is not only stretched, but it is thrown out of a very high window, but when a film is this much fun why complain.The script is very well set up, not only in terms of plot but in terms of structure. Each act has it's own set piece. Act one features the elevator sequence. Act two, the biggest act of the film takes place on the bus while the third and final act takes place on the train (a controversial contribution from Whedon and one that Yost was very unhappy with). Of course none of this would work without a great director at the helm and Jan de Bont rises to the challenge. While his career after this has been hit and miss (critics have slated his work but audiences have been forthcoming), here he shows that he has learned from being a director of photography for Paul Verhoeven and John McTiernan with a visual prowess and a handling of action sequences that is superb. In fact a lot of the film recalls Die Hard with the suspense arising from a plot that is quite simple yet deviously more complex in its execution. The biggest surprise at the time was that Keanu Reeves does wonderfully well in the role of the hero, Jack Tavern. He is charming, yet tough and while he doesn't really have to 'act' here, his performance is well done and he should be proud. Likewise Sandra Bullock in what is really her breakthrough role, even though it is her second major film after having been the female lead in Demolition Man. Her performance has all the hallmarks of her lovely girl next door act and her chemistry with Reeves works well. It is especially funny when he keeps calling her 'mam'.However the film is stolen from everyone's favorite psychopath Dennis Hopper. Brilliantly evil as Howard Payne, Hopper clearly enjoys playing a bad guy who enjoy being a terrorist ("the whim of a mad man, I like it"). While the role is not of the disturbing variety that Frank Booth is (this is a mainstream film after all), the role is great one and is instantly memorable, as is his death scene.If you have still to watch this film do. It is brilliant and is one of the best Hollywood action films of the nineties. Just don't watch the abysmal sequel.

A SWAT officer in Los Angeles (Keanu Reeves) tries to save the lives of people on a bus from a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) who has the vehicle rigged to blow up if it goes under 50 MPH. Sandra Bullock plays a passenger on the bus while Jeff Daniels is on hand as another SWAT officer."Speed" (1994) is a disaster/action movie that delivers the goods as a thrilling popcorn flick. While it's not great like "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991) it's arguably on par with "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" (1995).Although a top-of-the-line production, it lacks the human interest of "Terminator 2" and "Runaway Train" (1985) and the story is unbelievably contrived. But, if you can roll with it, it's a dynamic blockbuster, just kinda forgettable in the grand scheme of things.The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes, and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area, including Mojave Airport.GRADE: B-

This movie is based on the premise that a bus cannot drop below 50 miles an hour or a Bomb will go off. There's no way any bus can go on and on traveling over 50 mph through any city without wrecking. The more I watched the more the more unbelievable it became that this bus just doesn't wreck,it's so preposterous I had a smh so many times whole movie. I found a whole movie laughable...your mileage may vary.
