The sequel to Get Shory has Chili Palmer taking on the music business. Its not as good as the first film, but if taken on its own is a good time passer.The problem here is two fold. First the film has a running gag about hating sequels, which would be fine if it was just a joke and didn't extend to the film making. Few of the actors in this film seem to be doing more than walking through the film for the cash or as a joke and it shows. The second problem is that there is way way too much going on and way too many people doing it. It seems to me that every time that someone of note shows up the movie has to stop to give them their couple of minutes on screen. Usually the material is decent, but it slows the pace down. I kept wanting to speed things up.That said I did like the film, but regret having paid movie theater prices to do so. This is a rental, not something you pay ten bucks to see. If you get the chance to rent it or see it on cable give it a shot. Just don't expect an equal to Get Shorty.

This is no "Get Shorty" but it's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there's a lot of fun moments. However, the film is a bit uneven. It's a comedy, but then, how funny is the Russian Mafia? The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters, but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard. The movie is so crammed with celebrities that it's distracting and the parade of glitterati takes you outside the film more than once. It's less brutal than "Get Shorty" and the language is much milder, but it also lacks the freshness and irreverence that made "Get Shorty" so much fun. As sequels go, it's a pretty good movie, and John Travolta and others in the film are so obviously having a good time, it's impossible not to get into the groove. There are many charming performances, including The Rock and Andre 3000, both showing a real knack for comedy. Definitely worth a visit to the multiplex, as long as you keep your expectations in check.

12 May 2006. It's not easy trying to make a comedy out of nasty, sometimes lethal music industry, Russian Mafia, gangster movie. With The Rock and Vince Vaughn playing out of character along side Danny DeVito, James Wood, Cedric the Entertainer, and Harvey Keitel, Steven Tyler as well as the leading stars, John Travolta and Uma Thurman, and introducing Christina Milian as a good singer, dancer, performer, the stage is set for an unusual set up and double cross along with some good laughs. This breezy, entertaining movie isn't as dramatic nor as smooth as it could be, but the natural performances, the comic/dramatic elements make up for a lot of the chaos on the screen. This American version of Snatch (2000) or Lock, Stock, Two Smoking Barrels (1998) brings its own unique flair to the underbelly of the movie industry, a Cinderella Story of sorts. Seven out of Ten Stars.

In the sequel to 1995's 'Get Shorty,' John Travolta is all swagger and one-liners, reprising his role as shylock/movie producer Chili Palmer. This time around, Chili abandons the fickle film industry for the ever-so-stable world of music, in an effort to discover the next big pop sensation and thus save the beautiful Edie's (Uma Thurman) ailing indie record label. When Chili takes a promising young singer (Christina Milian) under his wing, however, he finds himself in hot water with a wannabe gangsta/mogul (Vince Vaughn), a gay bodyguard (The Rock), and a slew of Russian mobsters. With a bounty on his head and time running out, Chili realizes there's only one way to come out on top: 'Be Cool.' This was a comedy. And with comedy you allow for the nonsense. The nonsense makes us laugh. However, the comedy in this movie was clichéd. There was a white guy acting black, a gay aspiring actor, shady record producers and homicidal rappers. Of course John Travolta danced with Uma Thurman. Count the movies John Travolta doesn't dance in. And to boot, Cedric the Entertainer was not funny. It hurts me. The first introduction audiences had to Chili Palmer was unique. But in the sequel, we already knew Chili's cool as ice, no nonsense approach to project management. The only thing we had to look forward to was the immense supporting cast, most of whom were incredibly disappointing. I'm not going to say it was totally unfunny. I laughed. But also, I cried. I cried. It's strictly a numbers game. Put 75 people in the cast and someone is bound to make you laugh. As for the completely insulting product placements, note to Hollywood producers, AUDIENCE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW.I feel bad now. Then again I don't. I've often said that sequels are never as good as the first. The Godfather II's are the exception, not the rule.

The Shylock turned movie mogul is back for a sequel, and this time he is interested in music. The movie industry is just too fake whereas the people in the music industry are real. Chili Palmer, played by John Travolta, has the same antics and same behaviorisms. He is still smarter than the next guy, tougher than him too, and he can beat up your bodyguard.More characters are introduced in "Be Cool" and they are more outrageous. Actors such as Vince Vaughn, The Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, and Andre, bring some good flavor to the movie. Just like with "Get Shorty", there are other sub-plots that all tie together into the main plot and main character. The movie has more-or-less a similar theme and flow to it as "Get Shorty". I think there were a few more funny parts in "Be Cool", but it lacked the originality of "Get Shorty." I noticed that there was a different director for this project. His resume' isn't that long, but he has done "Friday", "The Negotiator","The Italian Job", and he is on "The Brazilian Job" project. These weren't that bad, nor was "Be Cool". If he continues to improve from here, he will wind up with a very nice career.

Elmore Leonard has been the source of Hollywood films for decades, but not until recently have filmmakers translated his prose into true success. With the triumvirate of Out of Sight, Jackie Brown, and Get Shorty, Leonard's characters have had a new lease on life. The latter was particularly adept at mixing interesting people in a clever plot with just the right dash of humor and edginess. How to follow up that one? Take the star, John Travolta, from that film and remix with a new, supporting cast behind and in front of the camera. What you get is Be Cool, a spry, 'wannabe' sequel that has its moments but doesn't feel quite as fresh as Get Shorty.Chili Palmer (Travolta) is still out of the rackets and getting bored with the movie business. When a music producer buddy is murdered by Russian mobsters, Chili decides to take matters in his own hands and teams with widowed producer Edie Athens (Uma Thurman). His first project is Linda Moon, a talented singer wasting away in a retro club. Unfortunately Moon is under contract to sleazy producer Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel) whose right hand man Raji (Vince Vaughn) and bodyguard Elliot (The Rock) are trying to kill Chili. Add to this mix an angry rap producer (Cedric the Entertainer) with his gang of thugs and police detectives on surveillance, and you get a story that's a might convoluted. Pretty soon double crosses abound as everyone begins to point fingers at one another in a way that reminds one of ..Oh yeah, Get Shorty. You just know that Chili will somehow find a way to save the day in an ingenious manner, and that justice will be meted out. How he gets to that point is the half the fun.John Travolta is getting a tad old for his role (which along with Pulp Fiction rejuvenated his career), but he succeeds in rekindling that suave, ultra confident Chili. Uma Thurman is light years from her Kill Bill success and really has an uninteresting character here. Each supporting actor is given his or her chance to shine, and for the most part they do just that and perhaps go over the top. Cedric the Entertainer is effective as a sophisticated rap producer whose entourage of 'gangstas' are out for blood. Harvey Keitel (whose amusing cameo concluded Get Shorty) gets a meaty role as the unscrupulous producer. Robert Pastorelli passed away last year, but his turn as a hit-man is a brief reminder of his versatility. Vince Vaughn is a hoot as Raji, who acts like he can walk the walk and talk the talk of a rapper. But it is The Rock (in a mere supporting part no less) who steals the film as the insecure bodyguard who yearns to be an actor performer. Just as Get Shorty boasted an assortment of cameos by movie industry stars, this film reveals the occasional cameo of musical names as well. Furthermore, featured player Danny DeVito (who also produced) has nothing more than what amounts to be a cameo and doesn't figure in the major plot thread.Of course you can't have a Travolta film without a featured dance number which, in this case reunites him with Thurman in a cute but unimaginative number that won't make you forget the rug-cutting moments in Saturday Night Fever, Urban Cowboy or Pulp Fiction. The soundtrack is thoroughly laced with a mixture of 1970's pop tunes and current rap. Closing credits have an amusing sequence of the principals strutting their stuff to rap music.There was always going to be a little breath holding to see if a new director (F. Gary Gray) and new screenwriter (Peter Steinfeld) could duplicate Get Shorty's success by Barry Sonnenfeld and Scott Frank respectively. In fact, Be Cool was held back from release in summer, 2004, which is often an ominous sign. The film is hit and miss especially in the first half. The musical performances go on much too long including the Aerosmith concert. A little trimming here and there would have been in order. When it finally hits its stride in the last portion, it coasts to a cute ending. At times the dialogue is downright clever and the plot does become intriguing. The film is reasonably successful in its own right but suffers from the high expectations of the previous film. In fact, when the story is over, it is not too far fetched to imagine Chili and gang making a nostalgic return when he is ready to conquer another phase of entertainment business like sports perhaps? Although Be Cool is a harmless bit of fun, it makes you respect the charms of its predecessor even more.

Back in 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld directed a movie that ended up on many  critics best of lists by the time the year's recaps were being printed  in entertainment publications. The movie was Get Shorty and it gave  lead star John Travolta his second big hit in as many years after Pulp  Fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi's lenses. Based on a  novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on wise guy Chili Palmer  (Travolta) and his attempts to break into the movie business.  I, for one, was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp  dialogue of the original. So much so, that when I heard there was going  to be a sequel, I seemed to forgo my usual shivering that occurs when a  studio tries to rehash what was a good idea over ten years later.  The sequel, also based on a novel by Leonard, is this time directed by  F. Gary Gray who's Italian Job in 2003 was one of the years highest  grossing films. Couple that with the cast now expanding to include Uma  Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn  and James Woods and you have all the makings of a great continuance in  the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990's.  This time round we pick up as Chili (Travolta) is leaving the movie  business after being disappointed in both himself and the industry for  participating in the making of a sequel to his successful first film.  Thanks in small part to his friend, Tommy Athens (Woods) and the  misfortune of his death, Chili decides to look into the lucrative and  dangerous music industry.  This first leads to the famous Viper club where Chili meets singing  sensation Linda Moon (Christina Milian) who as lead of an upstart trio,  can belt out tunes like Whitney Houston (that is, the Whitney before  Bobby Brown started bringing home the small packages of sugar).  Linda is under contract with Raji (Vaughn) who, with his overly  apparent gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock), plan to ensure Linda  fulfills the final five years of her contract even if that means  putting Chili on ice.  So with Linda's future in the balance, Chili weaves an interesting web  which will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer  (Cedric), the Russian mob, the police, Aerosmith's lead singer Steven  Tyler and a whole lot of angry gun pointing. Woo-Wheee! That sounds  exciting. So why wasn't it? Be Cool tries too hard to, well, be cool.  But the result is a film that unlike the original, has no heart and no  soul. Be Cool feels instead like it was directed by a Saturday Night  Live producer as there are individual scenes or skits that don't string  together over a whole movie. Take for example the scene where Travolta  and Thurman dance together for the first time since Pulp Fiction, as  Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene is forced  and should have ended up on the cutting room floor. Instead, it is  coupled between two other needless chapters that do nothing to push the  story forwards with any real thrust. The Aerosmith concert, and The  Rock's trip to a boot shop are also prime examples of individual  moments that don't amount to much of a movie when put together.  But those aren't the only issues with the sequel - which could probably  be renamed Product Placement with the amount of 2-Ways and Diet Pepsi's  that seem to stare at you more intensely than Chili's serious look. The  story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has  just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing.  Whether it is the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy that has a  movie poster of Sylvester Stallone's Rhinestone on the wall, no  characters is above offering us anything we haven't seen many times  before and in much better films.  With the magic all but gone from the first film, we end up with an  inferior product that is the second film in the past six months  (Ocean's 13 being the other) that cram a bunch of stars onto a marquee  only to end up as a movie that no actor would bring to an open  audition.  Be Cool was a major disappointment. I so wanted it to be the Get Shorty  of the new millennium and I ended up with a film where the outtakes  must have been a gas, but experience left me with a stinker.

'Get Shorty' saw loan shark Chili Palmer getting out of that illegal business and getting into the film business. Now he has had enough of that. When a friend who runs a music studio is murdered Chili decides to get into that business. This means working with Edie Athens, his friend's widow. He has already found a young woman he thinks they should promote but unfortunately she is under contract to somebody else. That isn't the only problem; the business is broke and owes money to some Russian gangsters and a hip-hop producer and his group of gangsta-rappers. If he doesn't find a way to raise the money he and Edie will be in real trouble.This is one of those films that has plenty of funny moments but is ultimately a bit disappointing. The story is a bit convoluted and is often far to knowing; Chili states that you can only use the 'F-word' once if you want to avoid an R rating... then he uses it for the only time in the film; later Steve Tyler, of Aerosmith talks about having film offers but never accepting any. The rating is also part of the problem; toning things down to get the PG-13 rating makes the film feel tame with scenes that should have a sense of danger being played for laughs. The cast contains many well-known actors; perhaps a little surprisingly the most entertaining performance comes from Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in a fairly early role as a gay Samoan bodyguard. Overall I'd say this wasn't a bad film; it just falls short of what it should have been.

Get Shorty was an excellent film. It was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot. Be Cool is like some cheap knock-off trying to pass for a sequel. John Travolta as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. He plays it like he's a bored movie exec, rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a Shylock. Uma Thurman, great in nearly every role she's ever played, comes off as strained and confusing. Is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? The chemistry between her and Travolta is strained and uncomfortable. Other than that, just add every movie cliché you can think of. A well-educated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer, an inept gangster wannabe in Andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian, a gimmicky black dude wannabe in Vince Vaughn, and a stupid celebrity cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was the Rock, who invents his own new cliché as a gay Samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: IT MAKES NO SENSE. Get Shorty was clever with Chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. But this film tries that with about a million different characters. And even Chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. Fans of Get Shorty be warned: this is a very different, very worse movie.

The former mobster and movie producer Chili Palmer (John Travolta), from "Get Shorty", is tired of the cinema industry and decides to veer his business to the music industry. He finds a new-talented singer, Linda Moon (Christina Milian), and offers to manage her career, after releasing her from the contract with the pimp-manager Raji (Vince Vaughn), his gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock) and his useless partner Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel). He looks for the widow Edie Athens (Uma Thurman), who has a bankrupted music business, and offers his support to help her to negotiate with the Russian mobsters and a dangerous gang of rappers that are menacing her business because of the debts of her dead husband Tommy Athens (James Woods). Using his skills of negotiator, Chili convinces Steven Tyler and the Aerosmith to promote Linda Moon in a concert."Be Cool" is a hilarious sequel of "Get Shorty", but the story is completely independent from the forgoing movie, using the character of Chili Palmer only. "Be Cool" uses the chemistry of John Travolta and Uma Thurman (from the unforgettable "Pulp Fiction"), the wonderful Steven Tyler and the Aerosmith, an unbelievable gay character for The Rock, Vince Vaughn and Cedric the Entertainer in very funny roles, a team of great actors (James Woods, Danny DeVitto, Harvey Keitel) and promotes the unknown Christina Milian, having many funny scenes and elements of a cult-movie. The music score is simply excellent and this film is a great entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Be Cool  O Outro Nome do Jogo" ("Be Cool  The Other Name of the Game")

Having watched Be Cool I feel I wasted my time and money on a huge pile of rubbish! John Travolta had one expression only - bored! Other fine actors like Uma & Harvey acted embarrassed to be seen in such utter tripe! The script was horrible, full of clichés and so NOT funny! I hated how much time was devoted to Christina singing. As a movie lover who always finds something good to see in every film, I was astonished how bad it was and nearly left after the first 30 minutes. I've nothing against the actors, in fact I like their films normally but this was poor acting, bad script in the extreme! Even the dancing scene was poor and unexciting. The Rock was the only likable actor in the whole thing and caused me to smile just a little. I am going to rewatch Get Shortly and remind myself what I liked about John as Chili!

I went to a screening of Be Cool today and I have to say it was very entertaining. I haven't seen Get Shorty so I cant really compare the movie to anything but Vince Vaughn and The Rock were laugh out loud funny and Andre 3000 was very good in his first major role. Christina Milian was not really used to her potential as an actress but displayed her ability to sing very well. The other performances from the actors in the movie you would probably expect without any surprise. I still cant get over how funny The Rock was and am extremely pleased thats hes done so well for himself and hope he does more comedies. Overall, its a good movie that should not disappoint too many people.

I was never really that much of a fan of Get Shorty, but for some reason I watched it like a zillion times after I taped it off TV years ago (I guess Dennis Farina was just too funny), so much so that I was word perfect in every scene. Sure, it was funny, but what ruined it for me was the obnoxious direction by Barry Sonnenfeld (who, in The Gator's opinion, is down there with Kevin "Antichrist" Smith as THE worst director in Hollywood) that oozed falseness and tackiness at every opportunity.Thankfully, F. Gary Gray has taken control of the sequel and it feels/looks less pedestrian and more er...cool. It's a stronger and funnier movie and, for a change, more of a new story than a simple sequel.Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is now bored with movies, sequels and Harry Zimm and reckons the music industry will be more exciting. His pal Tommy Athens (James Woods, who appears to have aged about 20 years since Vampires) is a veteran music producer and keen to get a movie made about his life, something involving gangsters, crooked deals and the Russian Mafia. Too bad Tommy is promptly gunned down in broad daylight by the evil Ruskies.Instead of making a movie about it, Chili takes Tommy's place and decides to stir things up at his record label and takes a shine to his widow (Uma Thurman). After watching starlet Linda Moon (Christina Milan) performing in a tawdry club, he promptly nicks her from her moron manager (a very funny Vince Vaughn) and promises to make her a huge star. Only problem is there's about 20 gangsters, a rival producer, a hit-man (the very funny and late Robert Pastorelli, whom I like a lot in his final movie ever) and a gay bodyguard (The Rock) out there to make things difficult for him.One might accuse Be Cool of being too self-aware in attempting to smooth over its shortcomings, but the cheeky humour and welcome light touch make it thoroughly inoffensive. Farina may be absent this time round, but The Rock, providing more proof then ever before that he's a great actor, steals the show and Vaughn is a laugh riot. It could be interpreted as a major flaw that these two characters totally overshadow Travolta and Thurman, but one can hardly be cool and eccentric at the same time. As a result, the leads seem a bit dull.Since the first was hardly high art, it would be insane to judge Be Cool too harshly. Enjoy it on its own level and you'll see that it's actually better than the irritating Get Shorty.

I laughed twice watching this movie and in case you were wondering, I wasn't having a bad day nor was I subjected to anything else that would've skewed my opinion while watching this cinematic bowel movement. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I just couldn't. With all of this talent, you'd think this would've been at least watchable, right? Wrong.Let's play Sucked and Didn't Suck! John Travolta- Very likable. Though obviously buried under too much makeup, I found him to be enjoyable to watch. Didn't suck.Uma Thurman- After Kill Bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this atrociously written character. This character's big moment was showing someone how to operate a T-Mobile Sidekick. Sucked.Vince Vaughn- The done to death role of white guy who thinks he's black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character template still considered to be funny? I love the guy but I want to see him in something better than this. It felt like he was slumming. Sucked.Cedric the Entertainer- This guy is good. He delivers a great monologue after being called a racial slur (you can probably guess as to what it is) that was probably the best part of the movie. He was funny and truly elevated the material he was given just with his presence. Didn't suck.Harvey Keitel- Sucked due to a phoned in performance.James Woods- Sucked but not his fault. Actually, yes it was. Reminded me of his role in Casino for some reason. I don't like manic James Woods, I like slow burn James Woods. Victim of bad writing, maybe? Andre 3000- Sucked but he went down swinging. I think he has potential, as long as he's not being directed by a hack on his next picture.Christina Milian- She's absolutely beautiful and obviously talented but this movie isn't going to make her a star. Didn't suck but needs a better vehicle for her talents that isn't directed by a hack.The Rock- This should have been the role that catapulted him to movie stardom but as directed by F. Gary Gray, winds up sadly mishandled. In this movie, the Rock projects this charisma that makes him so likable that I wound up feeling sorry for him. He tries really hard and while he doesn't succeed completely, he gets an A+ for effort from me. This guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and go completely against type, playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on stardom. I really want to see him make it big. He has what it takes as long as he's not being directed by a hack.Which brings me to what I feel was the weak link in this production. I might as well just come out and say it, right? F. Gary Gray's direction was about as solid as really bad diarrhea. Wow, it was bad. Who had the bright idea of letting this guy direct? The Negotiator was good but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job? Between his direction and the atrocious writing, I'm willing to chip in for both culprits to get a nice lead salad to the knees. Wanna see John and Uma dance? I might be able to think of another movie with those two that I could recommend watching instead of this. Not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost me to get into the theater.This movie could've been okay and it wasn't even "just okay".RATING: * out of *****.P.S. Fergie from Black Eyed Peas is noteworthy to mention. Sizzling!

John Travolta is back as Chili Palmer in Get Shorty's sequel, "Be Cool". Chili Palmer is a former movie producer (as seen in Get Shorty) who is a former mobster. He is not happy with how his career in the movies is going and decides to branch off in the music industry. It is in a somewhat seedy bar that Chili discovers Linda Moon (Christina Milian) working in a trio. Linda has a strong singing voice but is obviously going nowhere within her group. The movie is basically centered around Linda and her contract. Everybody seems to want it now that Chili has plans and knows what a talent she is.Getting all the characters on-screen spread them all out a little bit thin, with some barely getting any screen time at all. Most of the better characters got more screen time than I thought they would have. Thankfully, the great chemistry between Vince Vaughn and The Rock gets quite a bit of screen time. Another newcomer who delivers a surprising performance is André Benjamin, or André 3000 as Dabu. Dabu is one of the many in Sin LaSalle's (Cedric The Entertainer) entourage, along with many very large men.There are many more actors and actresses in this cast but the best characters were those mentioned above. Dustin Hoffman pulled off a great performance, as usual, but even he seemed overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Uma Thurman, Steven Tyler, Danny DeVito, James Woods, Harvey Keitel and many others round off this great cast. I doubt all these actors would commit to something as horrible as we are all led to believe.The Rock is starting to branch out with his acting range. His big gay bodyguard routine was hilarious, as I doubt I'll ever forget his rendition of "You're Not Woman Enough To Take My Man". Rock and Vince Vaughn as the wannabe pimp complimented each other perfectly and along with Cedric, they are the highlights of the movie. Also, Christina Milian looks to be one of the hotter new actresses on her way up and I was impressed by what I assume was her lip-syncing performance with Steven Tyler. Look for her to be around for awhile.This was a large cast and, for the most part, they all held their own. My honest review is that this movie is better than it is being given credit for, possibly due to the incredible amount of hype put into it, turning many viewers against it. I went into this movie with an open mind and not expecting a great movie and I came out entertained. Because of this, I can recommend this movie with a clear conscience.

Although not as funny nor the dialogue as brisk and witty as Get Shorty, Be Cool does have its fun moments, and for me most center around The Rock's performance as a naive gay bodyguard and budding actor.

Be Cool-John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Vince Vaughn, the Rock, Christina Millian, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin, Robert Pasterelli, Steven Tyler, Paul Adlestein, James Woods, Debi Mazar, Kimberly J. Brown, Danny Devito, Seth Green and Anna Nicole-Smith.Chili Palmer (Travolta) and music producer Tommy Athens (Woods) have lunch together to discuss a movie to be made about Tommy's life. Chili goes to the restroom, comes back only to find Tommy dead and a Russian with a black eye with a gun pointed at Chili's head. The Russian runs off. Chili then goes to see a struggling singer, Linda Moon (Millian) because she wants to hit it big, but her boss Raji (Vaughn) and his homosexual samoen bodyguard Elliot (Rock) won't let her. Chili punches Elliot and tells them that Linda is his. He then visits Edie Athens (Thurman), who is a widow, previously married to Tommy. They become entangled in gangsters Sinclair Russell (Cedric), his right hand man Dabu (Benjamin), and other gangsters that Tommy owed money to. Also, Harvey Keitel plays Nicky Carr. Nick hires Joe Loop (Pasterelli) to whack off Palmer, but he gets the wrong guy. It is very comlex, but here's my thoughts. It had a similar coolness to it as Get Shorty did, but had too many one note jokes. The Rock was great and funny and Vince Vaughn was interesting, but also Joe Loop was such a slime ball, it was fun to see Pasterelli in his last film before his death. Danny Devito reprised his role from Get Shorty, but not by much. He appeared at most a minute and a half in the entire film, being in 2 scenes and a small one in the credits.My Review: 7/10....has the cool potential.

I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is the sequel for the movie that needed no sequel.Chili is back but Rene Russo is gone without a peep. Unfortunately Chili's game was played out in the first movie and rather than find an interesting personal arc for him, they just have him stand around repeating lines from the first movie. It's pretty tepid. Travolta looks old here. It's like they move people around him because his bones are getting creaky. His pink lip gloss and the blue eye contacts are very weird. The 2nd bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She's a music producer, a role that requires her only to be the female Reuben Kincaid. ("Hey these kids have a great new sound.") In any scene she strikes the wrong pitch motivationally or emotionally or both. It's painful to watch. Despite it's plentiful problems, Be Cool gets better after a very unpromising start.I certainly got my laughs out of it (Vince Vaughan running around on fire, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, the Rock, a t-shirt that says "widow" on it), but it offers no great memories after it's over. It's a helium-light love fest from the first frame. There's no one as pricelessly idiotic as Gene Hackman in the first movie. It's just about doing good in the world, for a couple of kids who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. The first one wasn't preachy.Working in (repeatedly) gags & lines from the first movie is annoying as is the dumb concession to the Rock's wrestling fans (he raises his eyebrow twice) as are the droll inside jokes: Steven Tyler saying "I'm not the kind of singer that make appearances in movies" ar ar.The all-star spectacular line-up is part of the problem. The first movie wasn't burdened by "stars."For a buck rental let's call it even.

Chili Palmer is tired of the movie business after being forced to make a useless sequel starring Martin Weir. When a music producer friend is gunned down, he offers to help his widow run the business.Checking a talent that the producer had been talking to him about puts Chili at odds with a sleazy music manager, his bodyguard, and his equally sleazy partner. The mismanagement of the music company also gets Chili threatened by members of the Russian mafia and a suburban rap-mogul producer & his thugs led by his bumbling relative.All turns out well when it is determined that the dead producer's wife had at one time been the laundress for Aerosmith and making contact with Aerosmith leader Steven Tyler at a Lakers game, gets their protégé a duet with Tyler at an Aerosmith concert.......Get Shorty was a fresh comedy, bursting with ideas, quotes, and proper laughs. It also proved that when he could, Travolta was one of the coolest stars around. This time though, the makers have put way way too much into this film, and it eventually becomes a hotchpotch of good ideas without a decent conclusion to any of them.We get an obnoxious Vaughn with a career defining Johnson, who are at loggerheads with Cedric The entertainer, who is also at loggerheads with Harvey Kietel, whom is also at loggerheads with the Russian mafia. Add Chili and Uma Thurman trying to get a gig alongside Aerosmith, and it becomes more baffling as the film goes on.It's also too self aware to be outright funny. The joke about the F-bomb at the beginning mirrors Travolta's speech at the beginning of Swordfish, and the rest of the jokes fall flat. The film is borderline homophobic and racist, and even though Vaughn is a great actor, he should hang his head in shame for the way he plays his role, Imagine crossing Drexl and Soul Man, and you are half way there.But there is still fun to have here. As said before, Johnson is brilliant in this, again at a time before he himself became too self aware, and Cedric the Entertainer is hilarious in his role.But it all feels like it was made for making money and nothing else. It seems like Thurman was only cast because they could re-enact their famous scene from Pulp Fiction, and trying to get as many famous faces in the film is just brown nosing. Get Shorty was simple and fun.This is simple, but not as much fun. It's too Hollywood for it's own good...

John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his "negotiation skills," he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record.Before I saw this sequel, I had heard that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. The movie focuses on the music industry this time around instead of the movie industry. The music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes. I can't tell if this was the intention or not since Get Shorty did a nice job of spoofing the movie industry. The same can't be said for the sequel and the attempts just come as lazy.An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili and he does an okay job. His performance is kind of dull though. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn't measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that's it. Rating 6/10

While the plot was terrible, some of the characters were HYSTERICAL. Case in point: Vince Vaughn as Raji. One of my top 10 characters in ANY movie. He had it down. The Rock was also good. I don't care much for Uma Thurman in any role. Danny Devito had a 30 second cameo, so don't expect too much of him. Is a bit sad seeing the late Robert Pastorelli in his final role. He did a bang up job as Joe Loop. He'll be missed. Travolta is doing Travolta. Grins and all.If you are renting, stick around for the closing credits as they feature each of the players doing a little bit of dancing. Even the ones that don't make it all the way through the movie. Thus leaving you with a happy feeling! Just a fun little movie.

I saw a 12:45 a.m. show last night, and I would've walked out 20 min. in, but there was nowhere to go! Blatant product placement, juvenile script, so much talent gone to waste, gay-bashing...what didn't they do? The movie is also insanely long (we got out at 3). As a person who rarely pays full price at the movies, imagine my chagrin doling out $22 for this self-indulgent, mean-spirited nightmare (plus $2 parking). I woke up today still feeling depressed, and haven't been able to shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seemed straight up lost in this thing, as was I. When Cedric the Entertainer is the high-water mark (a man so un-entertaining that he has to call himself "the Entertainer" so you'll understand what it is he thinks he's doing), you have a serious problem. Also, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli is down-right creepy, since he died almost a year ago (March 10). This should give you an idea how long they've been polishing this turd. This movie is mean to the bitter end. We stayed just to make sure they didn't give Robert an "In Remembrance", which they didn't. Save yourself! Save your money! Save your soul!

This movie is absolutely hilarious and had me in tears. Idk how I have but seen this movie before now!

"Get Shorty" was a great movie. It was very clever, well-acted (except for Gandolfini's bogus southern accent), and very, very entertaining."Be Cool" was pretty much the same, but was so much like "Get Shorty" in its formula that there were no surprises, so it was a bit disappointing.Travolta, as Chili Palmer, was just as cool as in "Get Shorty", but was totally predictable, so not as entertaining.The only character I am still laughing about is The Rock's portrayal of Elliot Wilhelm, a gay bodyguard who isn't particularly good at anything. There is one scene where he auditions for role in a movie for Travolta that is priceless.And Vince Vaughn is at his usual quirky, over-the-top self as a white guy who acts like a black guy and just can't get anything right.I don't feel like my $7.50 was wasted, but if your choice is see "Be Cool" at the movies or rent "Get Shorty" (if you haven't seen it), rent "Get Shorty". Then rent "Be Cool" when the DVD drops.

The first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. These are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad. They constantly reference a movie called "Get Leo" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time they do this, you will be really angry. Travolta isn't very cool, neither is Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. They aren't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie though. If you haven't seen get shorty, you will probably like be cool. If you liked get shorty, you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.

The sequel to Get Shory has Chili Palmer taking on the music business. Its not as good as the first film, but if taken on its own is a good time passer.The problem here is two fold. First the film has a running gag about hating sequels, which would be fine if it was just a joke and didn't extend to the film making. Few of the actors in this film seem to be doing more than walking through the film for the cash or as a joke and it shows. The second problem is that there is way way too much going on and way too many people doing it. It seems to me that every time that someone of note shows up the movie has to stop to give them their couple of minutes on screen. Usually the material is decent, but it slows the pace down. I kept wanting to speed things up.That said I did like the film, but regret having paid movie theater prices to do so. This is a rental, not something you pay ten bucks to see. If you get the chance to rent it or see it on cable give it a shot. Just don't expect an equal to Get Shorty.

This is no "Get Shorty" but it's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there's a lot of fun moments. However, the film is a bit uneven. It's a comedy, but then, how funny is the Russian Mafia? The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters, but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard. The movie is so crammed with celebrities that it's distracting and the parade of glitterati takes you outside the film more than once. It's less brutal than "Get Shorty" and the language is much milder, but it also lacks the freshness and irreverence that made "Get Shorty" so much fun. As sequels go, it's a pretty good movie, and John Travolta and others in the film are so obviously having a good time, it's impossible not to get into the groove. There are many charming performances, including The Rock and Andre 3000, both showing a real knack for comedy. Definitely worth a visit to the multiplex, as long as you keep your expectations in check.

12 May 2006. It's not easy trying to make a comedy out of nasty, sometimes lethal music industry, Russian Mafia, gangster movie. With The Rock and Vince Vaughn playing out of character along side Danny DeVito, James Wood, Cedric the Entertainer, and Harvey Keitel, Steven Tyler as well as the leading stars, John Travolta and Uma Thurman, and introducing Christina Milian as a good singer, dancer, performer, the stage is set for an unusual set up and double cross along with some good laughs. This breezy, entertaining movie isn't as dramatic nor as smooth as it could be, but the natural performances, the comic/dramatic elements make up for a lot of the chaos on the screen. This American version of Snatch (2000) or Lock, Stock, Two Smoking Barrels (1998) brings its own unique flair to the underbelly of the movie industry, a Cinderella Story of sorts. Seven out of Ten Stars.

In the sequel to 1995's 'Get Shorty,' John Travolta is all swagger and one-liners, reprising his role as shylock/movie producer Chili Palmer. This time around, Chili abandons the fickle film industry for the ever-so-stable world of music, in an effort to discover the next big pop sensation and thus save the beautiful Edie's (Uma Thurman) ailing indie record label. When Chili takes a promising young singer (Christina Milian) under his wing, however, he finds himself in hot water with a wannabe gangsta/mogul (Vince Vaughn), a gay bodyguard (The Rock), and a slew of Russian mobsters. With a bounty on his head and time running out, Chili realizes there's only one way to come out on top: 'Be Cool.' This was a comedy. And with comedy you allow for the nonsense. The nonsense makes us laugh. However, the comedy in this movie was clichéd. There was a white guy acting black, a gay aspiring actor, shady record producers and homicidal rappers. Of course John Travolta danced with Uma Thurman. Count the movies John Travolta doesn't dance in. And to boot, Cedric the Entertainer was not funny. It hurts me. The first introduction audiences had to Chili Palmer was unique. But in the sequel, we already knew Chili's cool as ice, no nonsense approach to project management. The only thing we had to look forward to was the immense supporting cast, most of whom were incredibly disappointing. I'm not going to say it was totally unfunny. I laughed. But also, I cried. I cried. It's strictly a numbers game. Put 75 people in the cast and someone is bound to make you laugh. As for the completely insulting product placements, note to Hollywood producers, AUDIENCE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW.I feel bad now. Then again I don't. I've often said that sequels are never as good as the first. The Godfather II's are the exception, not the rule.

The Shylock turned movie mogul is back for a sequel, and this time he is interested in music. The movie industry is just too fake whereas the people in the music industry are real. Chili Palmer, played by John Travolta, has the same antics and same behaviorisms. He is still smarter than the next guy, tougher than him too, and he can beat up your bodyguard.More characters are introduced in "Be Cool" and they are more outrageous. Actors such as Vince Vaughn, The Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, and Andre, bring some good flavor to the movie. Just like with "Get Shorty", there are other sub-plots that all tie together into the main plot and main character. The movie has more-or-less a similar theme and flow to it as "Get Shorty". I think there were a few more funny parts in "Be Cool", but it lacked the originality of "Get Shorty." I noticed that there was a different director for this project. His resume' isn't that long, but he has done "Friday", "The Negotiator","The Italian Job", and he is on "The Brazilian Job" project. These weren't that bad, nor was "Be Cool". If he continues to improve from here, he will wind up with a very nice career.

Elmore Leonard has been the source of Hollywood films for decades, but not until recently have filmmakers translated his prose into true success. With the triumvirate of Out of Sight, Jackie Brown, and Get Shorty, Leonard's characters have had a new lease on life. The latter was particularly adept at mixing interesting people in a clever plot with just the right dash of humor and edginess. How to follow up that one? Take the star, John Travolta, from that film and remix with a new, supporting cast behind and in front of the camera. What you get is Be Cool, a spry, 'wannabe' sequel that has its moments but doesn't feel quite as fresh as Get Shorty.Chili Palmer (Travolta) is still out of the rackets and getting bored with the movie business. When a music producer buddy is murdered by Russian mobsters, Chili decides to take matters in his own hands and teams with widowed producer Edie Athens (Uma Thurman). His first project is Linda Moon, a talented singer wasting away in a retro club. Unfortunately Moon is under contract to sleazy producer Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel) whose right hand man Raji (Vince Vaughn) and bodyguard Elliot (The Rock) are trying to kill Chili. Add to this mix an angry rap producer (Cedric the Entertainer) with his gang of thugs and police detectives on surveillance, and you get a story that's a might convoluted. Pretty soon double crosses abound as everyone begins to point fingers at one another in a way that reminds one of ..Oh yeah, Get Shorty. You just know that Chili will somehow find a way to save the day in an ingenious manner, and that justice will be meted out. How he gets to that point is the half the fun.John Travolta is getting a tad old for his role (which along with Pulp Fiction rejuvenated his career), but he succeeds in rekindling that suave, ultra confident Chili. Uma Thurman is light years from her Kill Bill success and really has an uninteresting character here. Each supporting actor is given his or her chance to shine, and for the most part they do just that and perhaps go over the top. Cedric the Entertainer is effective as a sophisticated rap producer whose entourage of 'gangstas' are out for blood. Harvey Keitel (whose amusing cameo concluded Get Shorty) gets a meaty role as the unscrupulous producer. Robert Pastorelli passed away last year, but his turn as a hit-man is a brief reminder of his versatility. Vince Vaughn is a hoot as Raji, who acts like he can walk the walk and talk the talk of a rapper. But it is The Rock (in a mere supporting part no less) who steals the film as the insecure bodyguard who yearns to be an actor performer. Just as Get Shorty boasted an assortment of cameos by movie industry stars, this film reveals the occasional cameo of musical names as well. Furthermore, featured player Danny DeVito (who also produced) has nothing more than what amounts to be a cameo and doesn't figure in the major plot thread.Of course you can't have a Travolta film without a featured dance number which, in this case reunites him with Thurman in a cute but unimaginative number that won't make you forget the rug-cutting moments in Saturday Night Fever, Urban Cowboy or Pulp Fiction. The soundtrack is thoroughly laced with a mixture of 1970's pop tunes and current rap. Closing credits have an amusing sequence of the principals strutting their stuff to rap music.There was always going to be a little breath holding to see if a new director (F. Gary Gray) and new screenwriter (Peter Steinfeld) could duplicate Get Shorty's success by Barry Sonnenfeld and Scott Frank respectively. In fact, Be Cool was held back from release in summer, 2004, which is often an ominous sign. The film is hit and miss especially in the first half. The musical performances go on much too long including the Aerosmith concert. A little trimming here and there would have been in order. When it finally hits its stride in the last portion, it coasts to a cute ending. At times the dialogue is downright clever and the plot does become intriguing. The film is reasonably successful in its own right but suffers from the high expectations of the previous film. In fact, when the story is over, it is not too far fetched to imagine Chili and gang making a nostalgic return when he is ready to conquer another phase of entertainment business like sports perhaps? Although Be Cool is a harmless bit of fun, it makes you respect the charms of its predecessor even more.

Back in 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld directed a movie that ended up on many  critics best of lists by the time the year's recaps were being printed  in entertainment publications. The movie was Get Shorty and it gave  lead star John Travolta his second big hit in as many years after Pulp  Fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi's lenses. Based on a  novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on wise guy Chili Palmer  (Travolta) and his attempts to break into the movie business.  I, for one, was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp  dialogue of the original. So much so, that when I heard there was going  to be a sequel, I seemed to forgo my usual shivering that occurs when a  studio tries to rehash what was a good idea over ten years later.  The sequel, also based on a novel by Leonard, is this time directed by  F. Gary Gray who's Italian Job in 2003 was one of the years highest  grossing films. Couple that with the cast now expanding to include Uma  Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn  and James Woods and you have all the makings of a great continuance in  the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990's.  This time round we pick up as Chili (Travolta) is leaving the movie  business after being disappointed in both himself and the industry for  participating in the making of a sequel to his successful first film.  Thanks in small part to his friend, Tommy Athens (Woods) and the  misfortune of his death, Chili decides to look into the lucrative and  dangerous music industry.  This first leads to the famous Viper club where Chili meets singing  sensation Linda Moon (Christina Milian) who as lead of an upstart trio,  can belt out tunes like Whitney Houston (that is, the Whitney before  Bobby Brown started bringing home the small packages of sugar).  Linda is under contract with Raji (Vaughn) who, with his overly  apparent gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock), plan to ensure Linda  fulfills the final five years of her contract even if that means  putting Chili on ice.  So with Linda's future in the balance, Chili weaves an interesting web  which will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer  (Cedric), the Russian mob, the police, Aerosmith's lead singer Steven  Tyler and a whole lot of angry gun pointing. Woo-Wheee! That sounds  exciting. So why wasn't it? Be Cool tries too hard to, well, be cool.  But the result is a film that unlike the original, has no heart and no  soul. Be Cool feels instead like it was directed by a Saturday Night  Live producer as there are individual scenes or skits that don't string  together over a whole movie. Take for example the scene where Travolta  and Thurman dance together for the first time since Pulp Fiction, as  Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene is forced  and should have ended up on the cutting room floor. Instead, it is  coupled between two other needless chapters that do nothing to push the  story forwards with any real thrust. The Aerosmith concert, and The  Rock's trip to a boot shop are also prime examples of individual  moments that don't amount to much of a movie when put together.  But those aren't the only issues with the sequel - which could probably  be renamed Product Placement with the amount of 2-Ways and Diet Pepsi's  that seem to stare at you more intensely than Chili's serious look. The  story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has  just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing.  Whether it is the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy that has a  movie poster of Sylvester Stallone's Rhinestone on the wall, no  characters is above offering us anything we haven't seen many times  before and in much better films.  With the magic all but gone from the first film, we end up with an  inferior product that is the second film in the past six months  (Ocean's 13 being the other) that cram a bunch of stars onto a marquee  only to end up as a movie that no actor would bring to an open  audition.  Be Cool was a major disappointment. I so wanted it to be the Get Shorty  of the new millennium and I ended up with a film where the outtakes  must have been a gas, but experience left me with a stinker.

'Get Shorty' saw loan shark Chili Palmer getting out of that illegal business and getting into the film business. Now he has had enough of that. When a friend who runs a music studio is murdered Chili decides to get into that business. This means working with Edie Athens, his friend's widow. He has already found a young woman he thinks they should promote but unfortunately she is under contract to somebody else. That isn't the only problem; the business is broke and owes money to some Russian gangsters and a hip-hop producer and his group of gangsta-rappers. If he doesn't find a way to raise the money he and Edie will be in real trouble.This is one of those films that has plenty of funny moments but is ultimately a bit disappointing. The story is a bit convoluted and is often far to knowing; Chili states that you can only use the 'F-word' once if you want to avoid an R rating... then he uses it for the only time in the film; later Steve Tyler, of Aerosmith talks about having film offers but never accepting any. The rating is also part of the problem; toning things down to get the PG-13 rating makes the film feel tame with scenes that should have a sense of danger being played for laughs. The cast contains many well-known actors; perhaps a little surprisingly the most entertaining performance comes from Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in a fairly early role as a gay Samoan bodyguard. Overall I'd say this wasn't a bad film; it just falls short of what it should have been.

Get Shorty was an excellent film. It was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot. Be Cool is like some cheap knock-off trying to pass for a sequel. John Travolta as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. He plays it like he's a bored movie exec, rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a Shylock. Uma Thurman, great in nearly every role she's ever played, comes off as strained and confusing. Is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? The chemistry between her and Travolta is strained and uncomfortable. Other than that, just add every movie cliché you can think of. A well-educated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer, an inept gangster wannabe in Andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian, a gimmicky black dude wannabe in Vince Vaughn, and a stupid celebrity cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was the Rock, who invents his own new cliché as a gay Samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: IT MAKES NO SENSE. Get Shorty was clever with Chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. But this film tries that with about a million different characters. And even Chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. Fans of Get Shorty be warned: this is a very different, very worse movie.

The former mobster and movie producer Chili Palmer (John Travolta), from "Get Shorty", is tired of the cinema industry and decides to veer his business to the music industry. He finds a new-talented singer, Linda Moon (Christina Milian), and offers to manage her career, after releasing her from the contract with the pimp-manager Raji (Vince Vaughn), his gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock) and his useless partner Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel). He looks for the widow Edie Athens (Uma Thurman), who has a bankrupted music business, and offers his support to help her to negotiate with the Russian mobsters and a dangerous gang of rappers that are menacing her business because of the debts of her dead husband Tommy Athens (James Woods). Using his skills of negotiator, Chili convinces Steven Tyler and the Aerosmith to promote Linda Moon in a concert."Be Cool" is a hilarious sequel of "Get Shorty", but the story is completely independent from the forgoing movie, using the character of Chili Palmer only. "Be Cool" uses the chemistry of John Travolta and Uma Thurman (from the unforgettable "Pulp Fiction"), the wonderful Steven Tyler and the Aerosmith, an unbelievable gay character for The Rock, Vince Vaughn and Cedric the Entertainer in very funny roles, a team of great actors (James Woods, Danny DeVitto, Harvey Keitel) and promotes the unknown Christina Milian, having many funny scenes and elements of a cult-movie. The music score is simply excellent and this film is a great entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Be Cool  O Outro Nome do Jogo" ("Be Cool  The Other Name of the Game")

Having watched Be Cool I feel I wasted my time and money on a huge pile of rubbish! John Travolta had one expression only - bored! Other fine actors like Uma & Harvey acted embarrassed to be seen in such utter tripe! The script was horrible, full of clichés and so NOT funny! I hated how much time was devoted to Christina singing. As a movie lover who always finds something good to see in every film, I was astonished how bad it was and nearly left after the first 30 minutes. I've nothing against the actors, in fact I like their films normally but this was poor acting, bad script in the extreme! Even the dancing scene was poor and unexciting. The Rock was the only likable actor in the whole thing and caused me to smile just a little. I am going to rewatch Get Shortly and remind myself what I liked about John as Chili!

I went to a screening of Be Cool today and I have to say it was very entertaining. I haven't seen Get Shorty so I cant really compare the movie to anything but Vince Vaughn and The Rock were laugh out loud funny and Andre 3000 was very good in his first major role. Christina Milian was not really used to her potential as an actress but displayed her ability to sing very well. The other performances from the actors in the movie you would probably expect without any surprise. I still cant get over how funny The Rock was and am extremely pleased thats hes done so well for himself and hope he does more comedies. Overall, its a good movie that should not disappoint too many people.

I was never really that much of a fan of Get Shorty, but for some reason I watched it like a zillion times after I taped it off TV years ago (I guess Dennis Farina was just too funny), so much so that I was word perfect in every scene. Sure, it was funny, but what ruined it for me was the obnoxious direction by Barry Sonnenfeld (who, in The Gator's opinion, is down there with Kevin "Antichrist" Smith as THE worst director in Hollywood) that oozed falseness and tackiness at every opportunity.Thankfully, F. Gary Gray has taken control of the sequel and it feels/looks less pedestrian and more er...cool. It's a stronger and funnier movie and, for a change, more of a new story than a simple sequel.Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is now bored with movies, sequels and Harry Zimm and reckons the music industry will be more exciting. His pal Tommy Athens (James Woods, who appears to have aged about 20 years since Vampires) is a veteran music producer and keen to get a movie made about his life, something involving gangsters, crooked deals and the Russian Mafia. Too bad Tommy is promptly gunned down in broad daylight by the evil Ruskies.Instead of making a movie about it, Chili takes Tommy's place and decides to stir things up at his record label and takes a shine to his widow (Uma Thurman). After watching starlet Linda Moon (Christina Milan) performing in a tawdry club, he promptly nicks her from her moron manager (a very funny Vince Vaughn) and promises to make her a huge star. Only problem is there's about 20 gangsters, a rival producer, a hit-man (the very funny and late Robert Pastorelli, whom I like a lot in his final movie ever) and a gay bodyguard (The Rock) out there to make things difficult for him.One might accuse Be Cool of being too self-aware in attempting to smooth over its shortcomings, but the cheeky humour and welcome light touch make it thoroughly inoffensive. Farina may be absent this time round, but The Rock, providing more proof then ever before that he's a great actor, steals the show and Vaughn is a laugh riot. It could be interpreted as a major flaw that these two characters totally overshadow Travolta and Thurman, but one can hardly be cool and eccentric at the same time. As a result, the leads seem a bit dull.Since the first was hardly high art, it would be insane to judge Be Cool too harshly. Enjoy it on its own level and you'll see that it's actually better than the irritating Get Shorty.

I laughed twice watching this movie and in case you were wondering, I wasn't having a bad day nor was I subjected to anything else that would've skewed my opinion while watching this cinematic bowel movement. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I just couldn't. With all of this talent, you'd think this would've been at least watchable, right? Wrong.Let's play Sucked and Didn't Suck! John Travolta- Very likable. Though obviously buried under too much makeup, I found him to be enjoyable to watch. Didn't suck.Uma Thurman- After Kill Bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this atrociously written character. This character's big moment was showing someone how to operate a T-Mobile Sidekick. Sucked.Vince Vaughn- The done to death role of white guy who thinks he's black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character template still considered to be funny? I love the guy but I want to see him in something better than this. It felt like he was slumming. Sucked.Cedric the Entertainer- This guy is good. He delivers a great monologue after being called a racial slur (you can probably guess as to what it is) that was probably the best part of the movie. He was funny and truly elevated the material he was given just with his presence. Didn't suck.Harvey Keitel- Sucked due to a phoned in performance.James Woods- Sucked but not his fault. Actually, yes it was. Reminded me of his role in Casino for some reason. I don't like manic James Woods, I like slow burn James Woods. Victim of bad writing, maybe? Andre 3000- Sucked but he went down swinging. I think he has potential, as long as he's not being directed by a hack on his next picture.Christina Milian- She's absolutely beautiful and obviously talented but this movie isn't going to make her a star. Didn't suck but needs a better vehicle for her talents that isn't directed by a hack.The Rock- This should have been the role that catapulted him to movie stardom but as directed by F. Gary Gray, winds up sadly mishandled. In this movie, the Rock projects this charisma that makes him so likable that I wound up feeling sorry for him. He tries really hard and while he doesn't succeed completely, he gets an A+ for effort from me. This guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and go completely against type, playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on stardom. I really want to see him make it big. He has what it takes as long as he's not being directed by a hack.Which brings me to what I feel was the weak link in this production. I might as well just come out and say it, right? F. Gary Gray's direction was about as solid as really bad diarrhea. Wow, it was bad. Who had the bright idea of letting this guy direct? The Negotiator was good but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job? Between his direction and the atrocious writing, I'm willing to chip in for both culprits to get a nice lead salad to the knees. Wanna see John and Uma dance? I might be able to think of another movie with those two that I could recommend watching instead of this. Not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost me to get into the theater.This movie could've been okay and it wasn't even "just okay".RATING: * out of *****.P.S. Fergie from Black Eyed Peas is noteworthy to mention. Sizzling!

John Travolta is back as Chili Palmer in Get Shorty's sequel, "Be Cool". Chili Palmer is a former movie producer (as seen in Get Shorty) who is a former mobster. He is not happy with how his career in the movies is going and decides to branch off in the music industry. It is in a somewhat seedy bar that Chili discovers Linda Moon (Christina Milian) working in a trio. Linda has a strong singing voice but is obviously going nowhere within her group. The movie is basically centered around Linda and her contract. Everybody seems to want it now that Chili has plans and knows what a talent she is.Getting all the characters on-screen spread them all out a little bit thin, with some barely getting any screen time at all. Most of the better characters got more screen time than I thought they would have. Thankfully, the great chemistry between Vince Vaughn and The Rock gets quite a bit of screen time. Another newcomer who delivers a surprising performance is André Benjamin, or André 3000 as Dabu. Dabu is one of the many in Sin LaSalle's (Cedric The Entertainer) entourage, along with many very large men.There are many more actors and actresses in this cast but the best characters were those mentioned above. Dustin Hoffman pulled off a great performance, as usual, but even he seemed overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Uma Thurman, Steven Tyler, Danny DeVito, James Woods, Harvey Keitel and many others round off this great cast. I doubt all these actors would commit to something as horrible as we are all led to believe.The Rock is starting to branch out with his acting range. His big gay bodyguard routine was hilarious, as I doubt I'll ever forget his rendition of "You're Not Woman Enough To Take My Man". Rock and Vince Vaughn as the wannabe pimp complimented each other perfectly and along with Cedric, they are the highlights of the movie. Also, Christina Milian looks to be one of the hotter new actresses on her way up and I was impressed by what I assume was her lip-syncing performance with Steven Tyler. Look for her to be around for awhile.This was a large cast and, for the most part, they all held their own. My honest review is that this movie is better than it is being given credit for, possibly due to the incredible amount of hype put into it, turning many viewers against it. I went into this movie with an open mind and not expecting a great movie and I came out entertained. Because of this, I can recommend this movie with a clear conscience.

Although not as funny nor the dialogue as brisk and witty as Get Shorty, Be Cool does have its fun moments, and for me most center around The Rock's performance as a naive gay bodyguard and budding actor.

Be Cool-John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Vince Vaughn, the Rock, Christina Millian, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin, Robert Pasterelli, Steven Tyler, Paul Adlestein, James Woods, Debi Mazar, Kimberly J. Brown, Danny Devito, Seth Green and Anna Nicole-Smith.Chili Palmer (Travolta) and music producer Tommy Athens (Woods) have lunch together to discuss a movie to be made about Tommy's life. Chili goes to the restroom, comes back only to find Tommy dead and a Russian with a black eye with a gun pointed at Chili's head. The Russian runs off. Chili then goes to see a struggling singer, Linda Moon (Millian) because she wants to hit it big, but her boss Raji (Vaughn) and his homosexual samoen bodyguard Elliot (Rock) won't let her. Chili punches Elliot and tells them that Linda is his. He then visits Edie Athens (Thurman), who is a widow, previously married to Tommy. They become entangled in gangsters Sinclair Russell (Cedric), his right hand man Dabu (Benjamin), and other gangsters that Tommy owed money to. Also, Harvey Keitel plays Nicky Carr. Nick hires Joe Loop (Pasterelli) to whack off Palmer, but he gets the wrong guy. It is very comlex, but here's my thoughts. It had a similar coolness to it as Get Shorty did, but had too many one note jokes. The Rock was great and funny and Vince Vaughn was interesting, but also Joe Loop was such a slime ball, it was fun to see Pasterelli in his last film before his death. Danny Devito reprised his role from Get Shorty, but not by much. He appeared at most a minute and a half in the entire film, being in 2 scenes and a small one in the credits.My Review: 7/10....has the cool potential.

I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is the sequel for the movie that needed no sequel.Chili is back but Rene Russo is gone without a peep. Unfortunately Chili's game was played out in the first movie and rather than find an interesting personal arc for him, they just have him stand around repeating lines from the first movie. It's pretty tepid. Travolta looks old here. It's like they move people around him because his bones are getting creaky. His pink lip gloss and the blue eye contacts are very weird. The 2nd bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She's a music producer, a role that requires her only to be the female Reuben Kincaid. ("Hey these kids have a great new sound.") In any scene she strikes the wrong pitch motivationally or emotionally or both. It's painful to watch. Despite it's plentiful problems, Be Cool gets better after a very unpromising start.I certainly got my laughs out of it (Vince Vaughan running around on fire, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, the Rock, a t-shirt that says "widow" on it), but it offers no great memories after it's over. It's a helium-light love fest from the first frame. There's no one as pricelessly idiotic as Gene Hackman in the first movie. It's just about doing good in the world, for a couple of kids who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. The first one wasn't preachy.Working in (repeatedly) gags & lines from the first movie is annoying as is the dumb concession to the Rock's wrestling fans (he raises his eyebrow twice) as are the droll inside jokes: Steven Tyler saying "I'm not the kind of singer that make appearances in movies" ar ar.The all-star spectacular line-up is part of the problem. The first movie wasn't burdened by "stars."For a buck rental let's call it even.

John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his "negotiation skills," he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record.Before I saw this sequel, I had heard that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. The movie focuses on the music industry this time around instead of the movie industry. The music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes. I can't tell if this was the intention or not since Get Shorty did a nice job of spoofing the movie industry. The same can't be said for the sequel and the attempts just come as lazy.An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili and he does an okay job. His performance is kind of dull though. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn't measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that's it. Rating 6/10

While the plot was terrible, some of the characters were HYSTERICAL. Case in point: Vince Vaughn as Raji. One of my top 10 characters in ANY movie. He had it down. The Rock was also good. I don't care much for Uma Thurman in any role. Danny Devito had a 30 second cameo, so don't expect too much of him. Is a bit sad seeing the late Robert Pastorelli in his final role. He did a bang up job as Joe Loop. He'll be missed. Travolta is doing Travolta. Grins and all.If you are renting, stick around for the closing credits as they feature each of the players doing a little bit of dancing. Even the ones that don't make it all the way through the movie. Thus leaving you with a happy feeling! Just a fun little movie.

I saw a 12:45 a.m. show last night, and I would've walked out 20 min. in, but there was nowhere to go! Blatant product placement, juvenile script, so much talent gone to waste, gay-bashing...what didn't they do? The movie is also insanely long (we got out at 3). As a person who rarely pays full price at the movies, imagine my chagrin doling out $22 for this self-indulgent, mean-spirited nightmare (plus $2 parking). I woke up today still feeling depressed, and haven't been able to shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seemed straight up lost in this thing, as was I. When Cedric the Entertainer is the high-water mark (a man so un-entertaining that he has to call himself "the Entertainer" so you'll understand what it is he thinks he's doing), you have a serious problem. Also, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli is down-right creepy, since he died almost a year ago (March 10). This should give you an idea how long they've been polishing this turd. This movie is mean to the bitter end. We stayed just to make sure they didn't give Robert an "In Remembrance", which they didn't. Save yourself! Save your money! Save your soul!

This movie is absolutely hilarious and had me in tears. Idk how I have but seen this movie before now!

"Get Shorty" was a great movie. It was very clever, well-acted (except for Gandolfini's bogus southern accent), and very, very entertaining."Be Cool" was pretty much the same, but was so much like "Get Shorty" in its formula that there were no surprises, so it was a bit disappointing.Travolta, as Chili Palmer, was just as cool as in "Get Shorty", but was totally predictable, so not as entertaining.The only character I am still laughing about is The Rock's portrayal of Elliot Wilhelm, a gay bodyguard who isn't particularly good at anything. There is one scene where he auditions for role in a movie for Travolta that is priceless.And Vince Vaughn is at his usual quirky, over-the-top self as a white guy who acts like a black guy and just can't get anything right.I don't feel like my $7.50 was wasted, but if your choice is see "Be Cool" at the movies or rent "Get Shorty" (if you haven't seen it), rent "Get Shorty". Then rent "Be Cool" when the DVD drops.

The first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. These are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad. They constantly reference a movie called "Get Leo" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time they do this, you will be really angry. Travolta isn't very cool, neither is Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. They aren't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie though. If you haven't seen get shorty, you will probably like be cool. If you liked get shorty, you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.

Based on Elmore Leonard's novel, 'Be Cool' is an all around entertainer. Sequel to 'Get Shorty', Travolta is back as Chili Palmer and Danny Devito makes two cameo appearances. The rest of the fabulous cast includes the sensational Uma Thurman, a hilarious Vince Vaughn, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin, Robert Pastorelli and Christina Milian. Harvey Keitel proves to be very good in comedy but the real surprise is Dwayne Johnson who shows a knack for being funny and probably has the funniest role. F. Gary Gray does a neat job. The jokes work excellently. The film is well-paced and the writing is consistent. Steinfeld does a good job of rewriting Leonard's book for the big screen. The humour works excellently. None of the jokes fall flat and the cast and crew seem to have had a blast making this film. It's a shame that the film wasn't as big a success as it's prequel. Frankly, I enjoyed it more than 'Get Shorty'. Above all, 'Be Cool' is a splendid entertainer that will draw loads of laughs.
