Some people complain that the movie isn't visually impressive or doesn't hold up to recent movies. You just can't compare them! It's OK that the animation and special effects didn't take precedence over the actual story or characters and they didn't try to build an entire movie around a breakthrough in visual effects (I'm talking to you, "Happy Feet").I've watched Dumbo with my 2- and 4-year-olds and they like it just as much (or more) as any new release. I think it's fascinating that the bulk of the story is told through music and the sweet body language of the baby and his mother. Of course there's some important exposition that has to be given by Timothy or the gossipy elephants but overall, the most powerful scenes are when no one says a word. "Baby Mine" will always bring a tear to my eye.A movie that I loved as a child and has touched a different place in my heart as a mother.

This is the quintessential Disney cartoon: brief, engaging, and profound Â– storytelling at its finest. Where "Snow White" doesn't make the cut (begins with rapidly developing melodramatic plot, pauses for most of an hour to allow forest creatures and midgets to play cute, and wraps up quickly), "Dumbo" spins its wise lesson with elegant timing and charming characters. We all can use that magic feather once in a while.

All the other elephants shun Dumbo for his gigantic ears, and his mother has been locked up for protecting him, so he's all alone in the world... until Timothy Q Mouse shows up.A beautiful piece of work. At just 60 mins, it is short and sweet. But it also contains some of Disney's best visual poetry. Dumbo's not saying a single word means his entire character is created through the physical. The entire opening sequence, till the gossipy elephants start talking, plays out without words, and its like the best silent movies. Simply beautiful.Mrs Jumbo rearing up and destroying the big top to protect Dumbo from taunting kids is an incredible scene. Dumbo's mother spends the movie imprisoned in a carriage labelled "mad elephant" - and surely one of the most beautiful, heartbreaking scenes i've ever seen plays out when Dumbo and his mother have contact only by touching trunks, through the bars in the window of her cell. A beautiful sequence begins: the beautiful song "Baby Mine" plays as she cradles him in her trunk, and when Dumbo leaves she can't see him, and she stretches her trunk as far as she can out the window to try and reach him, and... oh, its too much!The pink elephants sequence is as close to trippy Disney ever got - and its brilliant. One of the best, most inventive sequences in animation history. Great song, too.Some terrific songs: Look Out for Mr Stork, Casey Junior (the train song), Pink Elephants, When I see an elephant fly and Baby Mine.10/10. Timothy Q Mouse is a great character, the animation is so concise and perfect, great songs, the message that if you believe you can overcome your handicaps you will so inspiring and beautiful, and the movie so short and sweet it will forever retain its appeal.

Dumbo is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. It is a very sweet, fun film for the whole family to enjoy, just running over an hour, it's quick and very easy to follow, but you will also find yourself very connected to these characters, the adorable elephant, the witty mouse, the charismatic crows, it's a great ride. However, the plot is slim, there is little story, we mainly follow Dumbo as he learns how to fly, but nothing really happens, in comparison to Disney's two films prior to this, Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, development is thin. The film certainly should have focused on Dumbo's relationship with his mother, it was the only part that had any real depth or emotion, and I think it could have been very effective had it been scoped more. It's certainly not flawless, but Dumbo is a fun hour for the whole family, some unforgettable work by Disney. A elephant who is ridiculed for his huge ears soon gains the ability to fly with them, making him a popular circus act. Best Performance: Edward Brophy

One of Disney's best known and loved films. About a baby elephant born in the tough world of the circus who is ridiculed and shut out because of his large ears. Comforted by his mother until she attacks a trainer and is penned up in a jaillike wagon, Dumbo eventually learns that he can fly and becomes a star. A great film that deals with discrimination, self esteem, the importance of family and friendship. Features a great score which it won an oscar for and a nomination for song, the beautiful "Baby Mine" . The pink elephants scene is a classic. Wonderfully done, arguably Disney's best on a scale of one to ten...10

Disney had spent vastly more money than he'd planned on "Pinnochio" and "Fantasia", and got little of it back.  "Dumbo", next off the rank, was made cheaply, quickly, without fuss.  The result is simple but handsome. However handsome "Dumbo" looks, the animation is not very detailed, character design is hardly adventurous, the colours are few but bright, and in an hour it's over.  It needn't be more than this, though: the story is far from complicated.  It is, I'll admit, a story that has made me cry more than once; and in this instance I don't feel that I've been cheated into crying, because there really is something poignant and heartbreaking about this ugly duckling variant.Like Hans Andersen, Disney has to pad the outfit a bit to make it fill the space available; yet, with the exception of the introductory bit with the storks, it doesn't feel like padding.  In fact the most gratuitous piece of padding is the most necessary.  I refer to the pink elephants sequence: a masterpiece of extended unreality (caused by such a tiny quantity of champagne!) which dazzles and sizzles and all but soars out of the screen. It's the sting in Dumbo's tail, and nothing produced since can match its verve.

This is clearly one of the great animated features of all time. How it squeaks by with a mere 7.4 voter average while all sorts of contemporary crap does far better is a mystery and a tribute to the downward spiral in cinematic taste. DUMBO is my favorite of all the classic Disney films (a group which ends with JUNGLE BOOK, completed after Walt's death). Nothing since then has been able to recapture the magic. Walt may have been, according to some people, a fascist and an anti-Semite, but he was also a genius.Things that make this movie great: The animation (I used to work at a zoo, and while the real elephants did little talking or singing the animators captured their body language incredibly well.)"Pink Elephants on Parade".Effective but not over-the-top heartstring tugging.The musical crow number ("When I See an Elephant Fly"). I'm disappointed to discover the voice actors (Including Cliff Edwards, "Ukelele Ike" and the voice of Jiminy Cricket) were white guys playing black --- I was hoping they were some cool unknown black combo --- but it's a terrific number anyway.The 64 minute running time. It starts, tells it's simple story, then knows when the hell to get off the stage. I wish more film makers had that ability.

Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, "Jim." It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

As a kid, I would watch over and over several Disney features: Pinnochio, Peter Pan, Bambi, Alice in Wonderland, Lady and the Tramp, and Dumbo. When I come back to those films now, I recognize that they are all marvelous films and gave Walt Disney much deserved success. It's truly sad how far Disney has fallen. All kids' flicks now are awful. I revisited Dumbo, by the way, on the same night that I first watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, destined to be one of the most successful films of all time. It is execrable, and it is simply pathetic how bad films like it are nowadays. I say, bring your kids back to Dumbo, Pinnochio, Bambi, and the like. They may not be as harmless as the kind of movie Disney and others shove out today. You shouldn't be afraid of your children showing emotion. I can remember more than anything being profoundly affected by the "Baby Mine" number from Dumbo, where he visits his imprisoned mother. Films like these will mould your children's emotional stability instead of keeping them at a safe distance and selling them toys.

Dumbo for me is a mini- masterpiece, with beautiful animation, an inspiring message and the sweetest elephant on screen. Dumbo is an elephant born with big ears, but who cares? True beauty comes from within. Dumbo's mother was like Bambi's mother, wise and memorable, and like Dumbo, misunderstood. The song "Baby of Mine" is so sad, that I always cry when I see this film because of it, Casey Jnr is very rousing and having a good laugh during "Seen an Elephant Fly". In regard to the crows, I saw nothing racist about them, they are stereotypical yes in a sense but in a positive way. Timothy the mouse is also memorable, a bit like Dumbo's conscience in a sense. For me, the highlight was Dumbo's dream, with the elephants dancing(a bit unrealistic but very imaginative), with ballet-like incidental music towards the end. I found the song "Elephants on Parade" catchy and I love how trippy the whole sequence is. In conclusion, I rejoiced when Dumbo conquered his fears, when it looked impossible. Great idea, Disney, about the flying elephant, although Don Bluth used a similar idea 50 years later for Pebble and the Penguin. A beautiful film, 10/10 Bethany Cox

Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid.The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well.The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it.If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

The shortest all-animated feature Disney ever made and my only regret is that it's not just a few minutes longer and that Dumbo's new-found success is illustrated only by three newspaper headlines when a few shots of Dumbo being chased by adoring fans or handing out autographs would have been most welcome. However, that's purely a personal opinion. Most people love the film exactly the way it is. And (aside from wishing it were just that mite longer), I do too.Oddly, my enthusiasm for Dumbo is a new-born thing. Many times I saw it as a child. I enjoyed the gossipy elephants ("Listen, girls, have I got a trunk-full of dirt?"), but I found many aspects of the film too grotesque for enjoyment - Dumbo himself; the clowns; particularly the "Pink Elephants"; even the circus train. As an adult, I enjoy these characters enormously. I revel in the inventiveness and wit of the drawing, I applaud the innovations of a more abstract, less formal Disney, I enjoy the polish and sophistication, the sly humor and satiric edge of the dialogue. Most of all, I gambol deliriously along with the songs, so consistently clever in lyrics ("I've seen a peanut stand, I've heard a diamond ring, but I've never seen an elephant fly!") and so catchily scored, who could resist?The answer is - children. If ever Disney made a cartoon that will appeal mostly to adults, Dumbo is it. No wonder Bosley Crowther went overboard in praise (all of it justly deserved)! No wonder Dumbo made the New York Times Ten Best Films of 1941.Admittedly, there are many grotesque elements in Disney's other feature cartoons which would repulse, terrify or antagonize children. Normally these are counterÂ¬balanced by an overdose of moralizing, by dreary stretches of sweetness and light. But Dumbo is uncompromisingly pragmatic. Its view of self-seeking self-fulfillment is undiluted by sentiment, strengthened by satire. Aside from Timothy Q. Mouse, the stork, Mrs Jumbo and Dumbo himself, the human and animal characters are either malicious (the elephants) or venal (the clowns, the ringÂ¬master). Of the "good" characters, the stork is too earnestly stupid and Mrs Jumbo too possessively simple-minded to elicit much sympathy - and even Timothy and Dumbo are often viewed primarily as simple figures of fun.No child could appreciate the gentle mockery of Dumbo in which clowns are presented as an uncomfortable mirror image of adults, and cartoon children are unflinchingly drawn as loutish brats.From a technical viewpoint, Dumbo represents the Disney craftsmen at the apex of their powers. From the timing of the visual gags to the swift editing of the fall of the pachyderms, from the brilliant atmosphere and color of the backgrounds and effects to the faultless dubbing of voice and song, from the clever characterizations of humans, animals and train to the amusing artistry of inventive surrealism on parade, Dumbo is a masterpiece.

I used to LOVE this film when I was little and then, like most other kids' films I forgot about it. However, the other night I was babysitting until 3.30am and to keep awake I invaded the family's video collection. On watching Dumbo, I was as moved as ever, but also reminded of what a scary and shadowy film it is. My brother had to be guided out of the cinema, crying with his hands over his eyes, when he saw it, and that says a lot for a kids' film. The use of shadows and silhouettes is widespread and the weather is largely rainy and stormy. I can remember being scared during the scene when the train is travelling through the stormy night and particularly when the men (all black, I notice) are building the Big Top. The Pink Elephants sequence is imaginative and impressive for adults but imagine watching it as a kid - it's pretty scary. It's strange to have a film where the main character, title character even, doesn't actually talk, but I suppose there's nothing for him to say, his actions and expressions say it all. The treatment of Dumbo's mother always gets me, particularly the beautiful and haunting "Baby Mine" scene. However, through all the sadness and sinisterness, the heart of the film shines through, and it's a beautiful one with a wonderful message.

Not very famous but adorable on its own.Take a look at Dumbo he never speaks and yet is so expressive.Keep tissues for ''Baby mine'',the most touching moment of the film.

Some people complain that the movie isn't visually impressive or doesn't hold up to recent movies. You just can't compare them! It's OK that the animation and special effects didn't take precedence over the actual story or characters and they didn't try to build an entire movie around a breakthrough in visual effects (I'm talking to you, "Happy Feet").I've watched Dumbo with my 2- and 4-year-olds and they like it just as much (or more) as any new release. I think it's fascinating that the bulk of the story is told through music and the sweet body language of the baby and his mother. Of course there's some important exposition that has to be given by Timothy or the gossipy elephants but overall, the most powerful scenes are when no one says a word. "Baby Mine" will always bring a tear to my eye.A movie that I loved as a child and has touched a different place in my heart as a mother.

I will never get how people still say that Bambi losing his mother is the worst in the classic disney films. For me it's Dumbos mother being imprisoned because she tries to protect her child. Yes, she's not dying, but it's still so very sad! And then we get this little adventure for Dumbo and his mousey companion. These two always remind me of Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket. The parade of the elephants - which Dumbo and Timothy Mouse are seeing when they're drunk (!) - is one of the craziest drug moments Disney ever did (probably only Alice in Wonderland can match it with it's weirdness). And it's so much fun to see Dumbo fly in the end and how he becomes a worldwide phenomenon after he got bullied around for such a long time.

I first watched ''Dumbo'' when I was very young,and I always remembered of it being a beautiful and sad movie. ''Dumbo'' in a way,is about the rejection of being different from the others and how this can hurt so much the people who are victims of people's prejudice. The main character Dumbo,does not speak a single word and even this way, you can know all the feelings he is passing through. The illustrators did a great job showing all animal's emotions in this way.A funny thing is that since I was a kid, I always found the scenes were the pink elephants were shown a little bit of creepy. They look like the clowns who were mocking Dumbo, maybe that's why I never felt a good vibe coming from this part of the movie.This movie is a classic from Disney and everybody should watch, including adults!

This is the quintessential Disney cartoon: brief, engaging, and profound Â– storytelling at its finest. Where "Snow White" doesn't make the cut (begins with rapidly developing melodramatic plot, pauses for most of an hour to allow forest creatures and midgets to play cute, and wraps up quickly), "Dumbo" spins its wise lesson with elegant timing and charming characters. We all can use that magic feather once in a while.

Dumbo is a unique animation, though short and thin story wise.Minus the standout moments, for the most part it's an odd mixture of cuteness and cruelty. My favourite parts of the film are the comedy parts; the two waking up in the tree with the crows and the clowns skit putting out the fire. The pink elephants scene's completely nuts.

All the other elephants shun Dumbo for his gigantic ears, and his mother has been locked up for protecting him, so he's all alone in the world... until Timothy Q Mouse shows up.A beautiful piece of work. At just 60 mins, it is short and sweet. But it also contains some of Disney's best visual poetry. Dumbo's not saying a single word means his entire character is created through the physical.

Great song, too.Some terrific songs: Look Out for Mr Stork, Casey Junior (the train song), Pink Elephants, When I see an elephant fly and Baby Mine.10/10.

Dumbo was the first, but certainly not the last, time in history when the Walt Disney Animation Studio was struggling to make ends meet and thus was forced to churn out a subpar movie in terms of quality. Fantasia, the previous Disney film, had been a catastrophe in the box office, and thus Dumbo was made with a very limited budget to earn some quick cash.And it shows. As a child you probably didn't really notice, but watch Pinocchio/Fantasia and this back to back and you can see that the animation level is nowhere close. The character models are simplified, the movement seems jerky and/or too fluid, like everyone is made of melting wax, the lines are somewhat rough and even the backgrounds are not that impressive. Of course, this is only when compared to Disney's previous standards. By any objective measure this is a well-animated film.And what it loses in aesthetics, it more than makes up in characters and charm. The story of Dumbo, a young elephant born with ears way too big, is a string-tucker beyond comparison. The story is also short and sweet enough that Dumbo doesn't overstay his welcome, and contains some really memorable scenes, like the Pink Elephants on Parade or Dumbo's mom's lullaby to her son. Good stuff in general. It's not the most complex of stories, but it's a lot better than it has any right to be, given the film's rushed nature.And that's Dumbo. It's probably meant for younger children than the typical Disney film, but like most films from the self-proclaimed greatest animation studio on Earth, it has some good material for adults to appreciate as well. I'm glad this film allowed them to stay on their feet.

This is clearly one of the great animated features of all time. How it squeaks by with a mere 7.4 voter average while all sorts of contemporary crap does far better is a mystery and a tribute to the downward spiral in cinematic taste. DUMBO is my favorite of all the classic Disney films (a group which ends with JUNGLE BOOK, completed after Walt's death). Nothing since then has been able to recapture the magic.

It starts, tells it's simple story, then knows when the hell to get off the stage. I wish more film makers had that ability.

'Dumbo' is one of Disney's classic films featuring an elephant with enormous ears who lives at a circus and who finds an unlikely-but-typical-pairing-for-Disney friend (a mouse, which elephants are supposed to be frightened of). The mouse provides Dumbo with confidence and a 'I think; therefore, I can' attitude to build confidence. (Such as a typical film for children's' stories.) Dumbo is supposed to be able to fly with the aid of his enormous ears.One of the best moments in this film is the scene where Dumbo gets drunk. (I'm not sure as to what parents though about this, but I can imagine that it did not go down very well.) Dumbo hallucinates over the drink and sees many marching elephants, 'pink elephants on parade.' This is a haunting and colourful little song featuring a kaleidescope of elephants.Overall, this is a memorable and lovable little film that I recommend.

Disney had spent vastly more money than he'd planned on "Pinnochio" and "Fantasia", and got little of it back.  "Dumbo", next off the rank, was made cheaply, quickly, without fuss.  The result is simple but handsome. However handsome "Dumbo" looks, the animation is not very detailed, character design is hardly adventurous, the colours are few but bright, and in an hour it's over.

The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, "the Sambo." The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other "white" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, "When I See a Elephant Fly" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was "Baby Mine", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun.

I've never found 1941's 'Dumbo' anything extraordinary, in all honesty.While Dumbo is extremely cute and simply adorable, he's the only great thing that this film has going for it. The animation, even when compared to that of Disney's first two films, isn't that good. It's very cartoony, none of the characters have aged brilliantly in that regard.The voice talent aren't anything grand, though that's expected given the main character doesn't speak. Edward Brophy's Mouse is amusing, though he's arguably a cut-and-paste of Jiminy Cricket from 'Pinocchio'.The message of the film is a little blurred, also. It certainly teaches the audience not to judge a book by its cover, but you expect it to stir up questions about circuses and the way the animals are treated, e.g. Dumbo's mother, but it never truly does.There's also a scene where Dumbo enters a hallucinogenic state which begins funnily, though really does go on for too long. It feels like it's just there to fill the already slacking run time, which adds to my belief that it's a film that was rushed out to make money - that could be me being overly cynical, though.Reading this review back, it does come across as if I hate the film - I don't, I just think it has a number of flaws to it.

Created during a simpler, more innocent time in America when cynicism wasn't as rampant as it is today and sentimentality wasn't as shunned on screen as it is now, DUMBO remains one of Disney's simpler animated classics with a perky score and a number of catchy songs.Among the numbers that I found delightful: "Look Out for Mr. Stork", "Casey Junior", "When I See An Elephant Fly", "Baby Mine", and the two standouts in animation technique: "Pink Elephants on Parade" (the film's most sophisticated bit of animation) and "The Song of the Roustabouts" which shows the men struggling to put up the circus tents during an oncoming storm.The animation itself is more cartoon-like than Disney's earlier classics but intentionally so. In the brief span of 74 minutes, a lot of ground is covered in the story of an elephant with over-sized ears, his biggest defect, which is turned into his biggest asset by the film's end, thanks to a clever mouse named Timothy (voiced by Ed Brophy).The "Roustabouts" number and the "Pink Elephants" sequence are two of the film's high points, thanks to masterful work by the artists and the clever background score.While not in the same class with other Disney works of that era, DUMBO remains a consistently entertaining little film that should find a huge audience with its appeal to the very young as well as their elders. The music by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace and Ned Washington is really its major asset, aside from some very well crafted animation.

As a kid, I would watch over and over several Disney features: Pinnochio, Peter Pan, Bambi, Alice in Wonderland, Lady and the Tramp, and Dumbo. When I come back to those films now, I recognize that they are all marvelous films and gave Walt Disney much deserved success. It's truly sad how far Disney has fallen. All kids' flicks now are awful. I revisited Dumbo, by the way, on the same night that I first watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, destined to be one of the most successful films of all time. It is execrable, and it is simply pathetic how bad films like it are nowadays. I say, bring your kids back to Dumbo, Pinnochio, Bambi, and the like. They may not be as harmless as the kind of movie Disney and others shove out today. You shouldn't be afraid of your children showing emotion. I can remember more than anything being profoundly affected by the "Baby Mine" number from Dumbo, where he visits his imprisoned mother. Films like these will mould your children's emotional stability instead of keeping them at a safe distance and selling them toys.

The stork delivers a baby to an elephant at a travelling circus. His mother wants to call him Jumbo Jr but after seeing his very large ears the other elephants start disparagingly calling him Dumbo. His clumsiness soon gets himself and his mother into trouble. He befriends a mouse who manages to get him gigs in the circus but he wastes these breaks. Surely there's something that he can do?A sweet, fun Disney classic. Some great, fantastical plot developments and scenes, all presented with great warmth. The bond between animals and their young is quite emotional and is wonderfully done.Not all sweetness and light though. There are some harrowing dramatic moments, especially the bullying of poor Dumbo and the treatment of his mother. Ultimately this gives Dumbo something to overcome so is necessary to the plot.The animation is brilliant and despite being made in 1941 the movie still looks great by modern standards.Not perfect though. The story feels a bit basic and touch incomplete. While there's some decent themes on display (anti-bullying, finding your talents, don't judge a book by its cover) the end result doesn't feel very profound: the movie could have done with an emotional, thought-provoking wrap-up.

Dumbo for me is a mini- masterpiece, with beautiful animation, an inspiring message and the sweetest elephant on screen. Dumbo is an elephant born with big ears, but who cares? True beauty comes from within. Dumbo's mother was like Bambi's mother, wise and memorable, and like Dumbo, misunderstood. The song "Baby of Mine" is so sad, that I always cry when I see this film because of it, Casey Jnr is very rousing and having a good laugh during "Seen an Elephant Fly". In regard to the crows, I saw nothing racist about them, they are stereotypical yes in a sense but in a positive way. Timothy the mouse is also memorable, a bit like Dumbo's conscience in a sense. For me, the highlight was Dumbo's dream, with the elephants dancing(a bit unrealistic but very imaginative), with ballet-like incidental music towards the end. I found the song "Elephants on Parade" catchy and I love how trippy the whole sequence is. In conclusion, I rejoiced when Dumbo conquered his fears, when it looked impossible. Great idea, Disney, about the flying elephant, although Don Bluth used a similar idea 50 years later for Pebble and the Penguin. A beautiful film, 10/10 Bethany Cox

"Dumbo" is one of the first full length animated movies to come out of the Disney studio's. It's also one of the shortest but there is a good reason for that. This had to be a cheap and fast production in order to compensate for the the loses long featured Disney animated movies "Pinocchio" and "Fantasia" made on their first release. It still is the cheapest full length Disney animated movie till date and it probably is also the shortest. The movie did became a success by the way at the box offices and it gained more money than both "Pinocchio" and "Fantasia" combined.It's also the first and only Disney movie that has a main character who doesn't say a word throughout the story. Nevertheless the Dumbo character really comes to life, thanks to the talent of the animators. He's an adorable and classic Disney character, with his trademark big ears and cute big blue eyes.But despite the fact that the movie is quite short (just over one hour), the movie doesn't really feel as if it's much shorter than any other Disney movie. It perhaps even feels a bit overlong. for I feel that "Dumbo" is a bit of a lacking movie that restrains itself too much to one location and too much on just a couple of characters. Disney movies are always filled with some really colorful and entertaining characters. "Dumbo" is also filled with that but most other character roles within this movie, besides Dumbo himself and Timothy, are not featured really prominently and they just randomly pop-up into the movie and are gone again. For example the crows. They are real classics but for how long are they actually in the movie? 3 minutes maybe?The story also feels really quite restrained and it's simplistic. Just think about it, what exactly is the main plot-line of this movie? Probably about Dumbo being accepted by the crowd and the other animals for what he is but this is quite thin really. When you now days come up with a story like this it goes straight into the garbage-can in the studio's executive office. It's the foremost reason why I don't enjoy watching this movie as much as any other Disney movie from around the same time period. Though it's definitely one fine and real quality movie, it's just not a movie I would like to watch over and over again.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

The shortest all-animated feature Disney ever made and my only regret is that it's not just a few minutes longer and that Dumbo's new-found success is illustrated only by three newspaper headlines when a few shots of Dumbo being chased by adoring fans or handing out autographs would have been most welcome. However, that's purely a personal opinion. Most people love the film exactly the way it is. And (aside from wishing it were just that mite longer), I do too.Oddly, my enthusiasm for Dumbo is a new-born thing. Many times I saw it as a child. I enjoyed the gossipy elephants ("Listen, girls, have I got a trunk-full of dirt?"), but I found many aspects of the film too grotesque for enjoyment - Dumbo himself; the clowns; particularly the "Pink Elephants"; even the circus train. As an adult, I enjoy these characters enormously. I revel in the inventiveness and wit of the drawing, I applaud the innovations of a more abstract, less formal Disney, I enjoy the polish and sophistication, the sly humor and satiric edge of the dialogue. Most of all, I gambol deliriously along with the songs, so consistently clever in lyrics ("I've seen a peanut stand, I've heard a diamond ring, but I've never seen an elephant fly!") and so catchily scored, who could resist?The answer is - children. If ever Disney made a cartoon that will appeal mostly to adults, Dumbo is it. No wonder Bosley Crowther went overboard in praise (all of it justly deserved)! No wonder Dumbo made the New York Times Ten Best Films of 1941.Admittedly, there are many grotesque elements in Disney's other feature cartoons which would repulse, terrify or antagonize children. Normally these are counterÂ¬balanced by an overdose of moralizing, by dreary stretches of sweetness and light. But Dumbo is uncompromisingly pragmatic. Its view of self-seeking self-fulfillment is undiluted by sentiment, strengthened by satire. Aside from Timothy Q. Mouse, the stork, Mrs Jumbo and Dumbo himself, the human and animal characters are either malicious (the elephants) or venal (the clowns, the ringÂ¬master). Of the "good" characters, the stork is too earnestly stupid and Mrs Jumbo too possessively simple-minded to elicit much sympathy - and even Timothy and Dumbo are often viewed primarily as simple figures of fun.No child could appreciate the gentle mockery of Dumbo in which clowns are presented as an uncomfortable mirror image of adults, and cartoon children are unflinchingly drawn as loutish brats.From a technical viewpoint, Dumbo represents the Disney craftsmen at the apex of their powers. From the timing of the visual gags to the swift editing of the fall of the pachyderms, from the brilliant atmosphere and color of the backgrounds and effects to the faultless dubbing of voice and song, from the clever characterizations of humans, animals and train to the amusing artistry of inventive surrealism on parade, Dumbo is a masterpiece.

Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid.The songs are pretty good as well. "Baby Mine" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well.The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it.If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

I used to LOVE this film when I was little and then, like most other kids' films I forgot about it. However, the other night I was babysitting until 3.30am and to keep awake I invaded the family's video collection. On watching Dumbo, I was as moved as ever, but also reminded of what a scary and shadowy film it is. My brother had to be guided out of the cinema, crying with his hands over his eyes, when he saw it, and that says a lot for a kids' film. The use of shadows and silhouettes is widespread and the weather is largely rainy and stormy. I can remember being scared during the scene when the train is travelling through the stormy night and particularly when the men (all black, I notice) are building the Big Top. The Pink Elephants sequence is imaginative and impressive for adults but imagine watching it as a kid - it's pretty scary. It's strange to have a film where the main character, title character even, doesn't actually talk, but I suppose there's nothing for him to say, his actions and expressions say it all. The treatment of Dumbo's mother always gets me, particularly the beautiful and haunting "Baby Mine" scene. However, through all the sadness and sinisterness, the heart of the film shines through, and it's a beautiful one with a wonderful message.

Personally, and despite recognizing its legion of admirers and fans, this is one of the classic Disney films that I least appreciate. I don't really know why. As a child, I could have seen it if I wanted to, but it never attracted me, nor did it charm me when I saw it as an adult. Maybe because it's set in a circus (I hate the circus, I always have). However, I recognize that it is a quality work, even if it is not as exquisite and detailed as other films from the same period. After some reading, I discovered that the film was released at a time when the studio needed to make a financial hit, following the box office failures of "Pinocchio" and "Fantasia". That's why the film is less beautiful, it has simpler and cheaper animations. And interestingly, it was a great success, although I feel that, at the moment, it is a little forgotten.The story of the film is very simple. So simple that it almost can't handle a feature film! It all starts with the birth of a baby elephant, which is brought by a stork to a visibly emotional mother elephant. Everything looks perfect, but the little baby sneezes and his ears immediately take on an immensely large size, turning the baby into a strange creature that everyone makes fun of. Things get even worse when his mother is arrested and separated from him for trying to defend him. Sad, lonely and friendless, transformed into the clown of the circus, he will have to trust a little mouse to figure out how to turn around and win his place and everyone's respect.The movie is a lot shorter than most Disney movies, and that's a good thing, because, as you can see, it doesn't have a script solid enough to last much longer. The film drags on and makes several musical breaks in order to last at least an hour, and there are a number of songs that seem like real parenthesis, or intervals, in the story told. This happens with the tender song "Baby Mine", in which Dumbo is affectionately snuggled by his imprisoned mother, and with the dreamlike scene of the pink elephants, which provides us with a psychedelic and frenetic visual that only reappears in the film art many decades later. Between pauses and advances, the story works satisfactorily and gives rise to a good soundtrack full of quality songs.As I've already mentioned, the visual quality of the animations in this film is far from the best ever made by Walt Disney Studios. I appreciated the softness of the colors and the light, but the line is quite blurred and faint, and we don't have drawings as detailed and rich as we have seen in previous and later films. Although the title character is mute, communicating his emotions and thoughts through non-verbal language, the film has a good cast of voices including Sterling Holloway, Edward Brophy, Verna Felton, Cliff Edward, Herman Bing, Dorothy Scott and Sarah. Selby, among others.

I think if I would describe this movie with one word it would be "depressing". It's hard to watch all these characters being so cruel to a little baby elephant who doesn't even have the voice to defend himself against it all. I disliked this movie as a child, because so much in this movie feels mean-spirited and upsetting. I remember thinking I was glad the movie was over, instead of actually being happy for the characters, since I was left with such a bad mood after all that had happened.I also found the Pink Elephant Parade creepy and it really serves no point to the plot. As for the songs, I didn't really like them much. "Baby Mine" was the only one I truly liked.The animation is great though.
