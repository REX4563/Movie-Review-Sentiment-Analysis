The original 'Planet of the Apes' is better than the 2001 remake on almost every level. May be Tim Burton's version looks better, no wonder with Burton as the director, but the direction itself, the cinematography, the story and the performances in Franklin J. Schaffner's original are much better and more interesting.Heston is Taylor, who crashes with his spaceship on what seems to be a deserted planet. He and two other survivors start searching for life. They run into other human beings, and at that time they are all attacked by apes. The apes speak English, the human beings are mute. In this society a human being is what apes are in our society. Animals, nothing more. The humans are taken for research, Taylor as well, and since he is shot in the neck he is not able to talk at first. One of his fellow survivors is dead, what happened to the other is unsure. A female ape who is a scientist discovers that Taylor understands her, and even thinks he can talk. Of course this is not what the high people in this society want to hear.The movie has some very interesting elements. Worlds are upside down, as Taylor says, and in a way the movie puts a mirror in front of us. The human beings are humiliated in exactly the way we treat animals. What would we do if another mammal suddenly knew how to speak our language? We would probably react the same as the apes do in this movie and therefore it is even more interesting.In liked the movie very much, and some very nice moments in particular. Early in the movie Taylor gets a woman in his cage. He calls her Nova (Linda Harrison). We know what the apes want, and it is funny because it is exactly how we do this kind of stuff to our animals. The apes are even surprised when Taylor wants to keep his woman, and therefore seems monogamous.With some nice touches, a great and famous ending, some quotes that will sound very familiar, Charlton Heston as a pretty good leading man, a score from Jerry Goldsmith that is perfect for a movie like this, nice direction and a fine cinematography by Leon Shamroy this movie is a very good classic.

1968 seems to have been something of a watershed year for cinematic science fiction. It was the year that both 2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes were released. Both films were game changers in that they were big budget sci-fi made by the major studios. Up until that time, the genre had been very much mostly the province of the B movie. After the massive success of those two a series of often extremely interesting science fiction films were released by the studios. In effect these movies created a situation where the genre could flourish, with bigger budgets and more seriousness. Of course those films were quite different; while both dealt with some serious themes, 2001 is by far the more intellectual and is pure hard sci-fi - Planet of the Apes, on the other hand, lay somewhere between 2001 and traditional action-adventure fare.It does have definite social commentary and like many sci-fi films, it's about the time it was made as much as it is a look into the future. It considers the dangers of nuclear war and comments on the racial tensions of 60's America - both through allegory in its post-apocalyptic world. I guess this is one of the things that makes it work so well, the upside down society of the Planet of the Apes allows for an underlying message while at the same time offering up a thrilling sci-fi adventure scenario. To be perfectly honest, it works great as the latter. For me, the best parts are the early scenes leading up to the capture of the astronauts. The mystery of the strange world and the unforgettable arrival of the horse-riding apes in the fields are terrific. While John Chambers has been rightly praised for the ape make-up, a lot of credit should also go to Leon Shamroy for his stunning cinematography which is particularly brilliant in these early scenes, with great shots from unusual high angles that makes the planet seem so very ominous. Kudos too, to Jerry Goldsmith for his soundtrack whose strange tones compliment the visuals. When we reach the ape town, it's the fantastic set-design that takes centre stage with those houses that seem to come out of the rocks organically. Charlton Heston leads the picture of course and he does provide star charisma but it's the character actors in the heavy make-up that make the best impression, namely Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans. And of course, well...there's that ending.

If you really look at this movie from a certain perspective this really is not that good. Yet Charlton Heston some how makes this into one of best sci-fi films ever.Charlton Heston provided something that most actors don't have. He has that look into the camera that can just describe so many things about his character and portrayal. He has that action hero look yet he is by all accounts a great actor. That is why when he just looks into the camera you get a powerful sense of what is happening on the screen. Heston actually is able to portray a man put into slavery by apes. Somehow though it works.Combined with Schaffner's directing abilities Heston and him were able to really take this movie to another level. Other than the costumes of the apes, even though they were pretty impressive for that time, everything looked very realistic allowing you to really get into the movie. That quality alone of this movie separates this between the ordinary sci-fi movies. It even has a plot. It is something we are all familiar with. A person fighting for their freedom and survival. Like everything else in this film the plot was also taken to another level. The ending was not cheap either it was a bit of a surprise and was really something I won't forget. It was one of those moments in movies you won't forget. This is a true classic.If you have seen any other Heston movies you just know that he is the king of sci-fi and transforms almost every single one of them, especially this one, into an unforgettable classic.

In the year 1968, two movies came out that changed modern day science-fiction films forever, 2001 A Space Odyssey was the most famous out of the two, but Planet of the Apes stands on its own ground and became a classic that it is universally acclaimed to be. Planet of the Apes is still way better than all of the sequels and remakes that has even been made.I remember the first time, I watched Planet of the Apes. I was a major Sci-Fi geek who loved Star Wars and Blade Runner. I was sitting down on the couch with my nerdy glasses, watching T.V. When all of a sudden the movie started, my friends told me the movie was very cheesy and lame. So I had extremely low expectations, but I told, whatever, I'll give it a try. After the film finished, I was completely flabbergasted and amazed to have seen this work of art. The visuals were great and the movie was extremely entertaining. But that's not the main reason I loved the film so much. It raises a lot of questions about our modern day society without letting social commentaries get in the way of the drama and action.The movie is easily one of the top ten best Sci-Fi films ever created, it stands high up with Star Wars, 2001 A Space Odyssey and The Day the Earth Stood Still. If you're a Sci-Fi, this movie is highly recommended because it deals with philosophical and sociological questions and its a must have.10/10 for this Masterpiece.

No one I know under 40 had seen this film, though we all joked about it as being a stereotypical "bad" film based on rumors. the title, and clips seen here and there.  Finally one weekend when I was working until 2:00 a.m. I went home and there was a sequel on late night TV, during the 30 year Planet of the Apes marathon.  It made me curious about the original and I tracked it down.  I have to say it blew me away!The film is philosophical, creative, absorbing and scary.  Excellent commentary on religion and just about everything else. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.  So far I haven't even been able to convince my friends to see it because there seems to be such a strong prejudice against it and some sort of entrenched belief it must be bad; in fact it is one of the finest films I've seen and I can see why it is a classic.If you enjoy films that make you think you simply can't dislike Planet of the Apes.

I had been avoiding watching 'Planet of the Apes' for a long time as I thought it would be one of those silly futuristic sci-fi movies with men fighting monkeys. However, the movie turned out to be so much more. The limited use of special effects give it an authentic look. Schaffner makes fine use of his equipments and crew. The reddish mountainous desert-landscape is mysterious and fascinating. The cinematography is good too. The makeup is terrific and beats what any CGI could have done. The plot is simple and yet engaging. One wonders what Taylor's fate will be. Just one you think it will take a predicted turn, you are thrown away with a surprising but layered twist. Some parts of the film are quite disturbing to watch (the museum sequence and the ending). The legendary Charlton Heston does a great job. Even though he brings the same persona that was evident in his other works, it is what Taylor required. However, the show-stealers are Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter. Hunter's funny, witty, compassionate and clever Zira and McDowell's nerdy, dedicated and devoted Cornelius bring a wonderfully humane quality to their characters. 'Planet Of The Apes' deserves to be watched because it is a well-made and marvelously acted film but it also raises some relevant questions regarding humanity and nature.

Planet of the Apes starts as space mission that left Erath in 1972 to travel in space at the speed of light for six months crash lands on a planet that doesn't look too dissimilar to Earth. Only three crew members survive, Taylor (Chartlon Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner) & Dodge (Jeff Burton) who find themselves in desert like conditions & struggling to survive the hostile planet. Just as all hope seems lost they encounter a tribe of humans who are then attacked by a group of man like talking Apes who have become the dominant race on the planet with man being the beast who are rounded up, put in zoos & experimented on. In the attack Landon & Dodge are lost while Taylor is shot in the the throat, unable to speak he is rounded up & put in a cage where kind Chimp female scientist named Zira (Kim Hunter) befriends Taylor & when he regains the ability to speak there are certain Ape hierarchy who want him dead so to preserve their own society & beliefs...Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner after J. Lee Thompson who was originally set to direct pulled out to make Mackenna's Gold (1969) this, I suppose, is considered as a true sci-fi classic & as I write this even makes it to number 228 in the IMDb's Top 250 & since this is a forty year old film that's pretty impressive going. The script from Twilight Zone host, creator & head writer Rod Serling & Michael Wilson was based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle although by all accounts refines it a little bit & adds that twist ending which surely everyone now knows, Planet of the Apes is a good solid sci-fi action adventure that uses the role reversal of a dominant Ape society living next to uncivilised wild human tribes to make some nice points about humanity, where we are going & has some strong social satire as well. From unfair trials to the religion versus science debate to prejudice to wanting to destroy what we don't understand to the ultimate devastation of war. Sure it's all good stuff, it's well written & it's very well put together & the fact most of the main character's are talking Apes it's deadly serious & it all works surprisingly well on various levels as a film that entertains & social satire that has meaning. Some of the sci-fi elements don't add up though, I don't believe the concept of time travel as described here & after a thousand odd years would that doll still be in perfect working order? Also I just don't believe Taylor wouldn't have guessed he was on Earth, I mean there are people there, Apes there, the technology is the same & the trees, sky water & terrain is exactly the same too so it wouldn't exactly take a genius to realise or even make an educated guess. Then there's that iconic twist ending, sure it's a great image but the fact everyone knows about it means it might not have the impact it once did & the fact most should realise that this is Earth means it shouldn't really come as much of a surprise. That's a minor quibble though in an otherwise very good sci-fi film that probably just about deserves it's classic status.The one outstanding area of Planet of the Apes is the Oscar winning make-up effects which are really very impressive even forty years later, the effects are very convincing & while not as good as the remake (no matter what anyone tells you) they hold up extremely well. There are some well staged action scenes too, in particular the sequence about thirty minutes in when the Apes attack & kill numerous humans while on horseback complete with memorable images of the Apes standing over the dead bodies of several humans posing for photographs. The opening as the three astronaut's walk through the harsh desert is also well shot & you can almost feel the heat & isolation. An extremely popular film at the time Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels, Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) & Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) as well as the short lived TV series Planet of the Apes (1974) & the animated TV series Return to the Planet of the Apes (1975) before it was remade as a hundred million blockbuster by Tim Burton back in 2001.With a supposed budget of about $5,800,000 this wasn't mega budget but all money went on screen it seems, this is a great looking & designed film. The acting is good especially from those wearing Apes make-up.Planet of the Apes is considered a sci-fi classic & despite one or two minor flaws I would largely have to agree, it's maybe one of those iconic films that everyone should see at least once.

i think that this movie had the best shock moment at the end of the film than any other film in history. i saw this movie when i was about 9 years old and was fascinated with the thought of apes evolving on another planet and had heard nothing about the ending. when the camera pulls out at the end and shows the statue of liberty i about sh_t my pants. i was totally shocked and awed and i will always remember that moment. i think this movie holds up even today and was way better than tim burtons awful remake. i mean come on mark wahlberg versus charlton heston. heston wins this one easily. moses vs dirk diggler ha! for the times the makeup job on the apes was excellent and its too bad they had to make 4 more of these movies and ruin the franchise.

Charlton Heston is the only survivor of a space expedition that has crashed on a planet some millions of light years from earth, and thus some 2,000 years in the future. He stumbles into a rude civilization in which apes rule, while the tribes of speechless humans are treated as wild animals and periodically rounded up for experimentation or extermination. Heston is wounded in the throat during his capture and is rendered mute like the others. Since he demonstrates signs of intelligence, he is singled out for behavioral examination and kept in a cage with a female of the species. The apes argue over whether he actually has brains or is simply aping his betters. When he regains his speech, it upsets everyone's view of life as it should be, as it's written down in the "scrolls" by the "law giver." His chief enemy is an orang-utan played by Maurice Evans. With the help of two enlightened scientific chimpanzees, Kim Hunter and Roddy MacDowell, he manages to escape with his Significant Other, only to discover that he has landed back on earth, whence he came, but that a war has destroyed humankind and left an ecological vacuum that has been filled by the great apes.Actually, the movie runs along three parallel tracks. One is the unraveling of the mystery of how the apes came to be superior to humans, and the moral behind the puzzle. A second involves the internal dissent among the apes, pitting those who scoff at the idea of man and culture, and those who believe Heston and want to see him saved and set free. The third is a running commentary on Western culture circa 1967, the era of flower power and hippies and rebellious youth and disgruntled, resentful elders clinging to old concepts. I discount the relationship between Heston and the young lady, since she doesn't speak and was in real life the mistress of the producer, Richard Zanuck.It all may seem a little preachy now, and in some respects incomprehensible to those who don't remember the tumultuous 1960s. The morphed wisecracks are still amusing though. "Don't trust anyone over thirty." Will the youngsters get that? Will they get Maurice Evans' speech before the Council of Three, which alludes twice to the Declaration of Independence and once each to Alexander Pope and George Orwell? Probably not. The apes seem to be getting righter all the time.There are other instructive evocations of current social dynamics. On Planet Ape, the lighter you are, the better off you are. The buff orang-utans are the aristocratic leaders. The grayish chimpanzees are their middle-class intellectuals and technicians, rather like today's nerds. The black gorillas are the grunts. They do all the wet work. They're the guards and the police force and the flunkies and the shoe-shine boys. An interesting remark by Heston in a commentary on the film: the three simian strata subjected themselves to voluntary segregation. The separate species hung out together, ate lunch together, and though they showed no evident hostility towards the others, they clearly preferred their own kind. Is this movie telling us more than we need or want to know? Shouldn't a sociologist find this as disturbing as Heston finds the wreck of the Statue of Liberty? Except for Charlton Heston, there's no acting worth commenting on. The others are buried in carefully designed make up. They can only project the most rudimentary expressions -- a slight frown, a weak smile -- and their voices could have easily been dubbed. Every actor, down to the extras, underwent this lengthy and elaborate disguise. Later versions of the tale, as the concept became degraded and decadent, saved time and money by giving the lesser performers simple rubber masks.They probably could have lowered the budget on this initial entry by using cheaper techniques. Few people would have noticed, and, really, the story is determinedly middle-brow, like Rod Serling's simple sermons on the excellent "The Twilight Zone" series. Not particularly subtle or challenging, the story is what might be called "thought provoking." It made scads of money, which accounts for the many sequels and the recent remake. If there's a nickel left to be made out of the franchise we can expect another one any minute.Yet it's an enjoyable movie -- amusing and, well, though provoking. Nice location shooting and imaginative art direction. See it with the kids. Explain to them that "we hold these truths to be self evident" is from a charter document, that Pope said "the proper study of mankind is man," and that Orwell wrote "some are more equal than others." They'll thank you for it and, with any luck, will climb down from the chandelier.

When I recently, for fun, ranked my favorite films in a top 100 list, Planet of the Apes ended up at 33. It was the second sci-fi on the list, after 2001, which ranked #1. I have always been disappointed and irked at the ill-will that some people have towards Planet of the Apes. I almost assaulted someone who described Apes as "one of those so-bad-it's-funny type of movies" a few months ago. I take this film very seriously, and I wish others would do the same.I think one of the reasons there is so much animosity against this one is that it is undeniably dated. Not too much, but it would be difficult to sit a young teenager, raised on 1990s movies, down in front of it and have him/her enjoy it. Even a young adult, between the ages of 18 and 25, would find it difficult. Planet of the Apes definitely exists in a specific time, the late 1960s. This was the best decade for film, churning out tons of both American and foreign masterpieces. Times were rough, and the Vietnam War was growing in intensity by the time Planet of the Apes was made. Because of this, we see many references to the current dilemma. The film willy-nilly debates issues like hunting, violence, animal rights, evolution vs creationism, class structure, and nuclear war. Taylor tells a young, rebellious, teenage chimpanzee not to trust anyone over 30 (a common youth adage in the late 60s). Yes, it has so many topics that it seems to be about to burst at times. And, yes, the satire does go overboard once in a while. Still, it is all argued passionately. You can tell that everyone involved, even Heston, believes in what they are saying. In its own way, Planet of the Apes is as intellectual and philosophical a film as 2001. I know that, when teens and younger people go see the Tim Burton remake (which is not great, btw), there are going to be many who overpraise it and say that it is much better than the original. You would have to be mentally handicapped to honestly believe so.

My first encounter with Planet of the Apes was through an artistic, black-and-white comic adaptation. As a child, I loved it. Later, I read Pierre Boulle's original novel, and I thought that was fantastic, too. With that background, I was seriously disappointed with the 'classic' film. (To be fair, though, the later cinematic renditions weren't any better, either.)I understand some of the filmmakers' decisions, like changing the ape society into a less advanced one, as the novel was practically unfilmable with the then available technology, but the oversimplification extended to the story and the characters, as well, and because of that little remained of the spirit of the book. The design and makeup of the gorillas are cool, Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter give fine performances, and the last scene (being a clever twist on the book's ending) is very effective and memorable, but overall the film feels cheap and shallow, at least compared with the book. It could have been much much better.For me, the third movie in the franchise, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, proved to be the most enjoyable. By basically turning the original story inside out while remaining faithful to both the plot and the spirit of Boulle's excellent novel, that is the one that got closest to the mark.

In a magnificent performance, Heston plays what he considers an "existential" character... He is a cynic who hates mankind enough to make him leave the Earth in search of "something better than man." Heston tries to make sense of this "upside-down" world, and in the process, Pierre Boulle raises such issues as balance of power, racism, the role of government, and evolution... The apes are seen with cameras and guns, but strangely, the sight of a paper airplane shocks them...Schaffner's ability to focus on the human element in the face of awesome spectacle is one of his greatest assets... He uses dizzying camera effects, very enthusiastic zooming and hand-held cameras at ground level during chases..."Planet of the Apes" is a magnificent visual experience, from the emerald lake at the beginning to the threatening sea-shore at the end... The desolate landscapes of the Utah and Arizona National Parks, represented into primeval ruins, make an appropriately setting for the first appearance of the talking apes, rounding up humans like animals... The apes themselves remain an astonishing achievement of make-up and performance... John Chambers receives an Academy Award for his art...The motion picture features one of Heston's strongest, most emotional performances... Heston escapes, fights and yells... He is violently treated, caged, dragged, and hosed with powerful jets of water... He runs barefoot through hills, mountains, plains and an ape city... He is raided by gorillas on foot and on horseback, humiliated by thoughtful chimpanzees and mad ape scientists, pelted by inhabitants of the Planet of the Apes...The terrific supporting cast is wholly convincing: Maurice Evans in the role of Zaius, the scientist who does not want his race to suffer the fate of the humans; the two friendly chimpanzees named Zira and Cornelius (Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall) are superb..."Planet of the Apes" also gives us something else:-Heston and his crewmen have landed on an unknown planet... They hear sounds of galloping horses and guns being fired... But what they see is incredible... Apes on horseback!"Bright Eyes" does surprise the apes who believe humans aren't capable... With those enraged words ("Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes!"), he shakes the entire foundation of ape society and causes the Semians to retreat in shock...The crucial scene where Taylor has been given a hearing: As he tries to explain to his captors that he's come from another planet in a spaceship, the scene cuts to the monkey tribunal - sitting in the classic "hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil, see-no-evil - pose...When a shaved Taylor kisses Zira in front of Cornelius who is suffering without complaining... An indecisive Zira expresses: "Allright. But you're so damned ugly!"The ultimate scene: Having finally escaped from his captors with his mate Nova (Linda Harrison), Heston rides along the beach on horseback to the Forbidden Zone, once a paradise... Suddenly he spots something unusual in the distance... He remembers what Zaius told him, "You may not like what you find!" What he can see was not a rock but salt-stained metal... As he draws closer, the camera slowly draws back and up to reveal what must come as a terrible shock... Backed by a magnificent and unusual Jerry Goldsmith musical score, "Planet of the Apes" is a stylish and thoughtful science fiction film, which starts and finishes splendidly... It is a superb exercise in fantasy, a fine suspense adventure, an exciting and provocative entertainment...

This known story is the first and best of the primates series; it starts when Taylor(recently deceased Charlton Heston) and three astronauts crash on a far planet and encounter a culture where the simians rule over. At the start they trek taken across the desert. Later discover humanity has gone awry and now is slave and reduced to beasts. Man is treated as animal of burden and regarded as scum. A couple of gorillas named Cornelius(Roddy McDowall) and Zira(Kim Hunter) think otherwise and even agree Taylor escape, accompanied by a gorgeous native named Nova(Linda Harrison). He's trapped and judged by Dr. Zaius(Maurice Evans) and the president of assembly(James Withmore).This is a classic sci-fi movie with metaphysical significance and reflexion about origin of human being, though also packs action, adventures, intrigue and entertainment. In spite of time, the original energy remains and results to be an agreeable fantasy. Exciting writing credits by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson from Pierre Boulle novel, though the amazing final scripted by Serling. One of the important attributes of this work, is the excellent, spectacular production design by Walter Scott. Glimmer and luminous cinematography by Leon Shamroy. Magnificent make-up by John Chambers, a first-rate expert, such as proved in 'Blade runner, Ssss, Island of Dr Moreau' among others. The picture is fabulously directed by Franklyn J Schaffner, utilizing a great visual sense. The film won two nominations for Academy Award, the best costume and sensational musical score by a top-notch Jerry Golsmith,- Schaffner's usual: Patton, Papillon-, and deservedly won Oscar for make-up by Chambers. Schaffner was an impressive director with hits : 'Boys from Brazil, Papillon, Patton, War lord', but also flops, : 'Lionheart, Island of streams, Nicholas and Alexandra and Sphinx'. Schaffner was one of the most innovate creative minds from the 70s and 80s.Followed by four inferior sequels and a TV series, as 'Beneath of the planet of apes'(70, Ted Post), 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes'(73, J.Lee Thompson).

Absolutely incredible. Easily in my top 10 all time, and that's saying something. This movie kept me captivated from the beginning all the way to the end. It combined a super setting and effects (at least for '68) and the casting was perfect. This movie included, in my opinion, one of the most memorable line in film history, "get your damn paws of me, you stinkin' apes!". Not to ruin it for anyone, the ending is also one of the best in film history. This easily won my award for most entertaining and original story ever, because it captivated the imagination, especially considering the fact that it could actually happen (it's a stretch, but...) This is a rather short response, but I could just go on and on saying how great it was, but it would only be redundant. Overall, this movie was absolutely incredible9.5\10 stars (I'm a tough reviewer)

Planet of the Apes teaches us to take a closer look at ourselves. From the opening speech by Heston as astronaut Taylor all throughout the movie, we, as a human species, are simply given a mirror to watch ourselves. The apes simply tell a tale of ignorance and abuse. It's a mixture of ape science and religion, just like the real world, the human world we live in. In that respect this movie has not dated at all.Most mirror aspects are the 'in your face'-type. A more subtle one is right before the famous ending when the apes have dug up artifacts of a previous civilization that was more advanced than theirs. This finding is ridiculed by the apes eldest, the wise one. If anyone has ever looked into the aspects of alternative history 'the human kind', one will find out that the reaction of the apes eldest is typical of the human scientists in our every day lives. Anything contradicting their theories is ridiculed based on beliefs, never on scientific proof. Just because it is more convenient. The same comment is given by the elderly wise ape. He knew and has always known about the old civilizations, he just tried to hide it. Although Planet of the apes is rather slow in the mid section, Heston is great and this movie is thought provoking when you take all aspects into account, not just the obvious ones. Recommended, even today.

I hadn't watched "Planet of the Apes" for a very long while. With the impending release of the 2001 version of the film, I decided to take another look at this old classic.I think anyone who hasn't seen "Planet of the Apes", will enjoy this film. The premise of future earth being dominated by "intelligent" apes makes for an interesting story. Coupled to this, are some excellent locations, decent performances and a neat ending.If, however you were looking for a scientifically rational, well scripted epic, better look elsewhere. "Planet of the Apes" script is filled with more holes than a swiss cheese.I was wondering why anyone would send a character like "Taylor" on a space mission. Was he supposed to be an astronaut? a scientist? or just a big boorish bully-boy. As the three scientists explore their new planet home, what do they do when they finally come across the first sign of life (a bush). They dig it up of course! I was also amazed at how nonchalant they all were when they came across the ape totems. I would expect an intelligent person, upon confirming the existence of other intelligent life, would display some appropriate measure of surprise and wonder (even fear).But it was all taken in stride by the characters in this film. Disappointing and unrealistic.There are many more anomalies, which spoilt the experience for me. More often than not, I found myself laughing while watching, and I don't think this was the intended response the director was looking for."Planet of the Apes" is a light-weight enjoyable, entertaining film. Just don't think about it too deeply.7/10

Apart from the cheesy ape prosthetics, this was a nearly perfect sci-fi movie that had absolutely no reason to remake it other than to make a fast buck! Nothing about the remake can beat many of the wonderful lines or scenes from the movie. Taylor yelling "Get your hands off me, do damned, dirty apes!" and "This is a MADHOUSE---a MADHOUSE!!" are classic lines and I also love the scene during Taylor's trial when the orangutans are sitting in the SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL poses! These are some of the greatest moments in film history and yet some moron wants a remake?!? The movie, despite having several writers come and go (including Rod Serling), is well scripted, directed and who could have done a better job than Charleton Heston or Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter? The film is creative, energetic and concludes with one of the most visually impressive scenes in sci-fi history. All these combine for a great film. PERIOD!

Somewhat dated and dumb. The sets,costumes, and make up aren't even state of the art for 1968. In the same year, Kubrick's "2001" had actors playing apes more convincingly, and "Barbarella" had more interesting sets. Some of the exterior sets in "Planet of the Apes" looked like they were influenced by the "Flinstones".A clever premise has not been developed with interesting or convincing details. The script is uneven ,contains inconsistencies, and lacks a strong conflict and point of view. And except for Kim Hunter, you don't necessarily care about the characters. Heston seems a bit long in the tooth to be an astronaut. And these astronauts of the future are none too bright. Wouldn't Heston and crew have looked at the sun, the atmosphere, and the topography, and realized that they were back on earth? Can you say Utah? And wouldn't they have guarded their only possessions (clothes and backpacks) more carefully? I'm assuming their backpakcks contained something necessary and useful for their survival and protection.And it's never made clear what the apes plan to do with the humans. Why don't they lobotomize Heston as they did "Landon"? Why shoot Heston, and then nurse him back to health? Especially since he represents a truth the elders want to suppress. And in this ape society, who's in charge? The apes seem brutal at first, and then benign, like Disney characters. And is there a munitions factory somewhere on this planet? Where do they get their guns and amunition? And could the Statue of Liberty remain intact after the destruction of the world?Franklin Schaffner uses space and geography imaginatively. Some of the situations are interesting, and the dialogue is sometimes clever and witty. The film begins slowly, and too much time is wasted on scenes of the apes refusing to acknowledge or deal with the obvious;that Taylor is an intelligent being. Overall, it's reasonably entertaining and worth a look. Not a film that can stand repeated viewings or scrutiny. If you like "Planet of the Apes", try John Boorman's "Zardoz"(1974) which is weirder, more imaginative, and intense.

Apes have been around longer than man. Why would they suddenly develop intelligence equal to humans? And at the end Heston sees the Statue of Liberty and realizes he's on Earth all along. Wouldn't the fact that the apes speak English be enough of a clue or did he think it was just an incredible coincidence that apes on another planet spoke English? Why all the downvotes? You know I'm right

The original 'Planet of the Apes' is better than the 2001 remake on almost every level. May be Tim Burton's version looks better, no wonder with Burton as the director, but the direction itself, the cinematography, the story and the performances in Franklin J. Schaffner's original are much better and more interesting.Heston is Taylor, who crashes with his spaceship on what seems to be a deserted planet. He and two other survivors start searching for life. They run into other human beings, and at that time they are all attacked by apes. The apes speak English, the human beings are mute. In this society a human being is what apes are in our society. Animals, nothing more. The humans are taken for research, Taylor as well, and since he is shot in the neck he is not able to talk at first. One of his fellow survivors is dead, what happened to the other is unsure. A female ape who is a scientist discovers that Taylor understands her, and even thinks he can talk. Of course this is not what the high people in this society want to hear.The movie has some very interesting elements. Worlds are upside down, as Taylor says, and in a way the movie puts a mirror in front of us. The human beings are humiliated in exactly the way we treat animals. What would we do if another mammal suddenly knew how to speak our language? We would probably react the same as the apes do in this movie and therefore it is even more interesting.In liked the movie very much, and some very nice moments in particular. Early in the movie Taylor gets a woman in his cage. He calls her Nova (Linda Harrison). We know what the apes want, and it is funny because it is exactly how we do this kind of stuff to our animals. The apes are even surprised when Taylor wants to keep his woman, and therefore seems monogamous.With some nice touches, a great and famous ending, some quotes that will sound very familiar, Charlton Heston as a pretty good leading man, a score from Jerry Goldsmith that is perfect for a movie like this, nice direction and a fine cinematography by Leon Shamroy this movie is a very good classic.

1968 seems to have been something of a watershed year for cinematic science fiction. It was the year that both 2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes were released. Both films were game changers in that they were big budget sci-fi made by the major studios. Up until that time, the genre had been very much mostly the province of the B movie. After the massive success of those two a series of often extremely interesting science fiction films were released by the studios. In effect these movies created a situation where the genre could flourish, with bigger budgets and more seriousness. Of course those films were quite different; while both dealt with some serious themes, 2001 is by far the more intellectual and is pure hard sci-fi - Planet of the Apes, on the other hand, lay somewhere between 2001 and traditional action-adventure fare.It does have definite social commentary and like many sci-fi films, it's about the time it was made as much as it is a look into the future. It considers the dangers of nuclear war and comments on the racial tensions of 60's America - both through allegory in its post-apocalyptic world. I guess this is one of the things that makes it work so well, the upside down society of the Planet of the Apes allows for an underlying message while at the same time offering up a thrilling sci-fi adventure scenario. To be perfectly honest, it works great as the latter. For me, the best parts are the early scenes leading up to the capture of the astronauts. The mystery of the strange world and the unforgettable arrival of the horse-riding apes in the fields are terrific. While John Chambers has been rightly praised for the ape make-up, a lot of credit should also go to Leon Shamroy for his stunning cinematography which is particularly brilliant in these early scenes, with great shots from unusual high angles that makes the planet seem so very ominous. Kudos too, to Jerry Goldsmith for his soundtrack whose strange tones compliment the visuals. When we reach the ape town, it's the fantastic set-design that takes centre stage with those houses that seem to come out of the rocks organically. Charlton Heston leads the picture of course and he does provide star charisma but it's the character actors in the heavy make-up that make the best impression, namely Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter and Maurice Evans. And of course, well...there's that ending.

If you really look at this movie from a certain perspective this really is not that good. Yet Charlton Heston some how makes this into one of best sci-fi films ever.Charlton Heston provided something that most actors don't have. He has that look into the camera that can just describe so many things about his character and portrayal. He has that action hero look yet he is by all accounts a great actor. That is why when he just looks into the camera you get a powerful sense of what is happening on the screen. Heston actually is able to portray a man put into slavery by apes. Somehow though it works.Combined with Schaffner's directing abilities Heston and him were able to really take this movie to another level. Other than the costumes of the apes, even though they were pretty impressive for that time, everything looked very realistic allowing you to really get into the movie. That quality alone of this movie separates this between the ordinary sci-fi movies. It even has a plot. It is something we are all familiar with. A person fighting for their freedom and survival. Like everything else in this film the plot was also taken to another level. The ending was not cheap either it was a bit of a surprise and was really something I won't forget. It was one of those moments in movies you won't forget. This is a true classic.If you have seen any other Heston movies you just know that he is the king of sci-fi and transforms almost every single one of them, especially this one, into an unforgettable classic.

In the year 1968, two movies came out that changed modern day science-fiction films forever, 2001 A Space Odyssey was the most famous out of the two, but Planet of the Apes stands on its own ground and became a classic that it is universally acclaimed to be. Planet of the Apes is still way better than all of the sequels and remakes that has even been made.I remember the first time, I watched Planet of the Apes. I was a major Sci-Fi geek who loved Star Wars and Blade Runner. I was sitting down on the couch with my nerdy glasses, watching T.V. When all of a sudden the movie started, my friends told me the movie was very cheesy and lame. So I had extremely low expectations, but I told, whatever, I'll give it a try. After the film finished, I was completely flabbergasted and amazed to have seen this work of art. The visuals were great and the movie was extremely entertaining. But that's not the main reason I loved the film so much. It raises a lot of questions about our modern day society without letting social commentaries get in the way of the drama and action.The movie is easily one of the top ten best Sci-Fi films ever created, it stands high up with Star Wars, 2001 A Space Odyssey and The Day the Earth Stood Still. If you're a Sci-Fi, this movie is highly recommended because it deals with philosophical and sociological questions and its a must have.10/10 for this Masterpiece.

1968s PLANET OF THE APES has been my favorite film since I first saw it in April of that year when I was eight years old. The movie had a huge impact back then and I cannot emphasize more the power to grip the imagination it had -- and has -- and the shock the final image of the movie was back then. I literally left the theatre stunned and speechless. No other movie of my youth had such impact, or created such suspension of disbelief. Over the past thirty-four years PLANET OF THE APES has attained classic status and it's a tribute to the film's excellence that there are so many comments left here on the Internet Movie Database that this film is better than the viewer thought it would be, or that it wasn't campy or cheesy as they'd always thought, or that it was more intelligent and thought-provoking than most films they've ever seen, and that despite the studio stupidly putting the final shot -- one of the most famous last shots in the history of American cinema -- on the cover of the video, they were still stunned and haunted by it.PLANET OF THE APES is based on a 1963 French novel, "La planete des singes," by Pierre Boulle, most famous as the author of "La pont de la riviere Kwai" (1952), which became the 1957 film THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The story tells of a French journalist, Ulysse Merou, who, in the year 2500 travels with two companions in a near-light speed spacecraft to the red-giant star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion. There they find a sister planet to earth, Soror, and after landing on a remote plateau discover a race of human beings that are no more than animals, naked and unable to speak. The three earthmen are stripped of there clothes by the humans, who hate anything that isn't natural. Their spacecraft is destroyed by the savage people and they are run off into the jungle. The next morning the tribe of wild humans are attacked by hunters, who are gorillas dressed like men, hunting like men, and acting and speaking like men. One of the earthmen is killed, another disappears, and Merou is captured, taken to a research lab, and subjected to scientific experiments.A sympathetic female animal psychologist, Dr. Zira, a chimpanzee, is intrigued by Merou keenness and soon learns that this man is highly intelligent and able to learn speech. With her help Merou learns all about the simian civilization on Soror, in which the apes live in modern cities, drive cars, fly planes, and watch TV, and where conservative orangutans, especially one named Zaius, so fear this intelligent human being that they seek to have him destroyed. With the help of Zira's fiance, an archeologist named Cornelius, Merou unwittingly discovers a secret about the origins of intelligent life on Soror that's so dangerous he's forced to flee the planet of the apes and return to earth.Boulle's novel is a satire in the tradition of Voltaire that mocks humankind's anthropocentric theory of the universe from which human beings derive their sense of importance, and is laced with the kind of harrowing ironies that Boulle was famous for.The movie based on this book is an 'Americanized' adaptation of it. Rod Serling did the first drafts of the screenplay, simplifying the plot by fitting it into the mold of his "Twilight Zone" TV series and introducing an anti-nuclear war theme not present in the Boulle novel. Because of budget constraints the modern ape civilization had to be reduced to a less technological one, something more reminiscent of ancient Greece. In fact, after Michael Wilson, who had also adapted Boulle's "Bridge Over the River Kwai" to the screen, was brought in to do the final script drafts what emerged was a political allegory more akin to an Aesop fable than a Voltairian satire.An improvement on the book was to turn the Merou character, now named Taylor, into a misanthrope and to reduce the scope of the story into a kind of 'misanthrope's comeuppance.' Charlton Heston was a perfect choice to play the unlikable American astronaut, having essayed such similar 'bastard' roles in 1954s THE NAKED JUNGLE, 1963s DIAMOND HEAD and 1963s 55 DAYS AT PEKING, and the movie would be a lot less funny and pointed without him.Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter, as Cornelius and Zira, and Maurice Evans, as Dr. Zaius, enjoy some of the best performances on the screen, bringing the then-innovative makeup design of John Chambers to life under the intelligent and stylish direction of Franklin J. Schaffner. Also excellent in this Arthur P. Jacobs production for 20th Century-Fox is the veteran cinematographer Leon Shamroy's Panavision lensing, which makes great use of remote areas of southern Utah around Lake Powell to suggest an alien world, and Jerry Goldsmith's avant-garde musical score, which has become a landmark, cannot be emphasized more for contributing to the weird atmosphere and eerie mood of the movie. Rarely has a movie score so fit like hand-in-glove than this one.PLANET OF THE APES was a box office smash in 1968, but if ever there was a movie that was more a victim of its own success it's this one. Four sequels, two TV series, numerous novelizations and comic book adventures, and a lamentable remake in 2001 have been spawned by its popularity, most of which has been so inferior in quality to have tarnished the reputation of this classy and intelligent SF film landmark. Luckily the qualities of the film remind viewers again and again of what noted New Yorker movie critic Pauline Kael titled her review of this movie, "Apes must be remembered, Charlie!"

No one I know under 40 had seen this film, though we all joked about it as being a stereotypical "bad" film based on rumors. the title, and clips seen here and there.  Finally one weekend when I was working until 2:00 a.m. I went home and there was a sequel on late night TV, during the 30 year Planet of the Apes marathon.  It made me curious about the original and I tracked it down.  I have to say it blew me away!The film is philosophical, creative, absorbing and scary.  Excellent commentary on religion and just about everything else. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.  So far I haven't even been able to convince my friends to see it because there seems to be such a strong prejudice against it and some sort of entrenched belief it must be bad; in fact it is one of the finest films I've seen and I can see why it is a classic.If you enjoy films that make you think you simply can't dislike Planet of the Apes.

I had been avoiding watching 'Planet of the Apes' for a long time as I thought it would be one of those silly futuristic sci-fi movies with men fighting monkeys. However, the movie turned out to be so much more. The limited use of special effects give it an authentic look. Schaffner makes fine use of his equipments and crew. The reddish mountainous desert-landscape is mysterious and fascinating. The cinematography is good too. The makeup is terrific and beats what any CGI could have done. The plot is simple and yet engaging. One wonders what Taylor's fate will be. Just one you think it will take a predicted turn, you are thrown away with a surprising but layered twist. Some parts of the film are quite disturbing to watch (the museum sequence and the ending). The legendary Charlton Heston does a great job. Even though he brings the same persona that was evident in his other works, it is what Taylor required. However, the show-stealers are Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter. Hunter's funny, witty, compassionate and clever Zira and McDowell's nerdy, dedicated and devoted Cornelius bring a wonderfully humane quality to their characters. 'Planet Of The Apes' deserves to be watched because it is a well-made and marvelously acted film but it also raises some relevant questions regarding humanity and nature.

It's especially interesting that "Planet of the Apes" was released a few months before "2001: A Space Odyssey", as they both look at the same question: what will become of humanity (and how did we originate)? Obviously, the really famous line is Charlton Heston's snap at his captors, and the really famous scene is the end - which I won't tell here for fear of spoiling the whole movie. And what an impressive movie it is! Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Tim Burton's remake. "POTA" should never have been remade. So, for a cinematic treat, stick to this one and avoid the remake.One more thing is that some people have pointed out that the portrayals of the simians were kinda racist. The blond, cultured orangutans are the nobles; the dark-haired, mildly nervous chimpanzees are the scientists; and the dark-skinned, incompetent gorillas are the police. Oh well. It's still a good movie.

Planet of the Apes starts as space mission that left Erath in 1972 to travel in space at the speed of light for six months crash lands on a planet that doesn't look too dissimilar to Earth. Only three crew members survive, Taylor (Chartlon Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner) & Dodge (Jeff Burton) who find themselves in desert like conditions & struggling to survive the hostile planet. Just as all hope seems lost they encounter a tribe of humans who are then attacked by a group of man like talking Apes who have become the dominant race on the planet with man being the beast who are rounded up, put in zoos & experimented on. In the attack Landon & Dodge are lost while Taylor is shot in the the throat, unable to speak he is rounded up & put in a cage where kind Chimp female scientist named Zira (Kim Hunter) befriends Taylor & when he regains the ability to speak there are certain Ape hierarchy who want him dead so to preserve their own society & beliefs...Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner after J. Lee Thompson who was originally set to direct pulled out to make Mackenna's Gold (1969) this, I suppose, is considered as a true sci-fi classic & as I write this even makes it to number 228 in the IMDb's Top 250 & since this is a forty year old film that's pretty impressive going. The script from Twilight Zone host, creator & head writer Rod Serling & Michael Wilson was based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle although by all accounts refines it a little bit & adds that twist ending which surely everyone now knows, Planet of the Apes is a good solid sci-fi action adventure that uses the role reversal of a dominant Ape society living next to uncivilised wild human tribes to make some nice points about humanity, where we are going & has some strong social satire as well. From unfair trials to the religion versus science debate to prejudice to wanting to destroy what we don't understand to the ultimate devastation of war. Sure it's all good stuff, it's well written & it's very well put together & the fact most of the main character's are talking Apes it's deadly serious & it all works surprisingly well on various levels as a film that entertains & social satire that has meaning. Some of the sci-fi elements don't add up though, I don't believe the concept of time travel as described here & after a thousand odd years would that doll still be in perfect working order? Also I just don't believe Taylor wouldn't have guessed he was on Earth, I mean there are people there, Apes there, the technology is the same & the trees, sky water & terrain is exactly the same too so it wouldn't exactly take a genius to realise or even make an educated guess. Then there's that iconic twist ending, sure it's a great image but the fact everyone knows about it means it might not have the impact it once did & the fact most should realise that this is Earth means it shouldn't really come as much of a surprise. That's a minor quibble though in an otherwise very good sci-fi film that probably just about deserves it's classic status.The one outstanding area of Planet of the Apes is the Oscar winning make-up effects which are really very impressive even forty years later, the effects are very convincing & while not as good as the remake (no matter what anyone tells you) they hold up extremely well. There are some well staged action scenes too, in particular the sequence about thirty minutes in when the Apes attack & kill numerous humans while on horseback complete with memorable images of the Apes standing over the dead bodies of several humans posing for photographs. The opening as the three astronaut's walk through the harsh desert is also well shot & you can almost feel the heat & isolation. An extremely popular film at the time Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels, Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) & Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) as well as the short lived TV series Planet of the Apes (1974) & the animated TV series Return to the Planet of the Apes (1975) before it was remade as a hundred million blockbuster by Tim Burton back in 2001.With a supposed budget of about $5,800,000 this wasn't mega budget but all money went on screen it seems, this is a great looking & designed film. The acting is good especially from those wearing Apes make-up.Planet of the Apes is considered a sci-fi classic & despite one or two minor flaws I would largely have to agree, it's maybe one of those iconic films that everyone should see at least once.

i think that this movie had the best shock moment at the end of the film than any other film in history. i saw this movie when i was about 9 years old and was fascinated with the thought of apes evolving on another planet and had heard nothing about the ending. when the camera pulls out at the end and shows the statue of liberty i about sh_t my pants. i was totally shocked and awed and i will always remember that moment. i think this movie holds up even today and was way better than tim burtons awful remake. i mean come on mark wahlberg versus charlton heston. heston wins this one easily. moses vs dirk diggler ha! for the times the makeup job on the apes was excellent and its too bad they had to make 4 more of these movies and ruin the franchise.

Charlton Heston is the only survivor of a space expedition that has crashed on a planet some millions of light years from earth, and thus some 2,000 years in the future. He stumbles into a rude civilization in which apes rule, while the tribes of speechless humans are treated as wild animals and periodically rounded up for experimentation or extermination. Heston is wounded in the throat during his capture and is rendered mute like the others. Since he demonstrates signs of intelligence, he is singled out for behavioral examination and kept in a cage with a female of the species. The apes argue over whether he actually has brains or is simply aping his betters. When he regains his speech, it upsets everyone's view of life as it should be, as it's written down in the "scrolls" by the "law giver." His chief enemy is an orang-utan played by Maurice Evans. With the help of two enlightened scientific chimpanzees, Kim Hunter and Roddy MacDowell, he manages to escape with his Significant Other, only to discover that he has landed back on earth, whence he came, but that a war has destroyed humankind and left an ecological vacuum that has been filled by the great apes.Actually, the movie runs along three parallel tracks. One is the unraveling of the mystery of how the apes came to be superior to humans, and the moral behind the puzzle. A second involves the internal dissent among the apes, pitting those who scoff at the idea of man and culture, and those who believe Heston and want to see him saved and set free. The third is a running commentary on Western culture circa 1967, the era of flower power and hippies and rebellious youth and disgruntled, resentful elders clinging to old concepts. I discount the relationship between Heston and the young lady, since she doesn't speak and was in real life the mistress of the producer, Richard Zanuck.It all may seem a little preachy now, and in some respects incomprehensible to those who don't remember the tumultuous 1960s. The morphed wisecracks are still amusing though. "Don't trust anyone over thirty." Will the youngsters get that? Will they get Maurice Evans' speech before the Council of Three, which alludes twice to the Declaration of Independence and once each to Alexander Pope and George Orwell? Probably not. The apes seem to be getting righter all the time.There are other instructive evocations of current social dynamics. On Planet Ape, the lighter you are, the better off you are. The buff orang-utans are the aristocratic leaders. The grayish chimpanzees are their middle-class intellectuals and technicians, rather like today's nerds. The black gorillas are the grunts. They do all the wet work. They're the guards and the police force and the flunkies and the shoe-shine boys. An interesting remark by Heston in a commentary on the film: the three simian strata subjected themselves to voluntary segregation. The separate species hung out together, ate lunch together, and though they showed no evident hostility towards the others, they clearly preferred their own kind. Is this movie telling us more than we need or want to know? Shouldn't a sociologist find this as disturbing as Heston finds the wreck of the Statue of Liberty? Except for Charlton Heston, there's no acting worth commenting on. The others are buried in carefully designed make up. They can only project the most rudimentary expressions -- a slight frown, a weak smile -- and their voices could have easily been dubbed. Every actor, down to the extras, underwent this lengthy and elaborate disguise. Later versions of the tale, as the concept became degraded and decadent, saved time and money by giving the lesser performers simple rubber masks.They probably could have lowered the budget on this initial entry by using cheaper techniques. Few people would have noticed, and, really, the story is determinedly middle-brow, like Rod Serling's simple sermons on the excellent "The Twilight Zone" series. Not particularly subtle or challenging, the story is what might be called "thought provoking." It made scads of money, which accounts for the many sequels and the recent remake. If there's a nickel left to be made out of the franchise we can expect another one any minute.Yet it's an enjoyable movie -- amusing and, well, though provoking. Nice location shooting and imaginative art direction. See it with the kids. Explain to them that "we hold these truths to be self evident" is from a charter document, that Pope said "the proper study of mankind is man," and that Orwell wrote "some are more equal than others." They'll thank you for it and, with any luck, will climb down from the chandelier.

When I recently, for fun, ranked my favorite films in a top 100 list, Planet of the Apes ended up at 33. It was the second sci-fi on the list, after 2001, which ranked #1. I have always been disappointed and irked at the ill-will that some people have towards Planet of the Apes. I almost assaulted someone who described Apes as "one of those so-bad-it's-funny type of movies" a few months ago. I take this film very seriously, and I wish others would do the same.I think one of the reasons there is so much animosity against this one is that it is undeniably dated. Not too much, but it would be difficult to sit a young teenager, raised on 1990s movies, down in front of it and have him/her enjoy it. Even a young adult, between the ages of 18 and 25, would find it difficult. Planet of the Apes definitely exists in a specific time, the late 1960s. This was the best decade for film, churning out tons of both American and foreign masterpieces. Times were rough, and the Vietnam War was growing in intensity by the time Planet of the Apes was made. Because of this, we see many references to the current dilemma. The film willy-nilly debates issues like hunting, violence, animal rights, evolution vs creationism, class structure, and nuclear war. Taylor tells a young, rebellious, teenage chimpanzee not to trust anyone over 30 (a common youth adage in the late 60s). Yes, it has so many topics that it seems to be about to burst at times. And, yes, the satire does go overboard once in a while. Still, it is all argued passionately. You can tell that everyone involved, even Heston, believes in what they are saying. In its own way, Planet of the Apes is as intellectual and philosophical a film as 2001. I know that, when teens and younger people go see the Tim Burton remake (which is not great, btw), there are going to be many who overpraise it and say that it is much better than the original. You would have to be mentally handicapped to honestly believe so.

Planet of the apes is a classic with the apes the rulers and man the primates. The make up was fantastic and so was most of the acting.Three astronauts end up on a strange planet where apes speak and rule the planet and the three astronauts are taken captive by the apes.One of the astronauts Taylor is trying to make many attempts to talk but he can't because of the pain in his throat.One of the apes, Vira pays more attention to Taylor because of his major attempts to speak and keeps asking Cornelious and Dr.Zais what will happen when he speaks and one reply is:"human see,human do!" Planet of the apes did start boring but it got good in the middle and the ending was amazing.It was followed by four sequels and a remake.The sequels are called:"Beneath the planet of the apes","Escape from the planet of the apes","Conquest of the planet of the apes" and "Battle for the planet of the apes".I recommend this to sci-fi fans nd those who are interested in watching it.

My first encounter with Planet of the Apes was through an artistic, black-and-white comic adaptation. As a child, I loved it. Later, I read Pierre Boulle's original novel, and I thought that was fantastic, too. With that background, I was seriously disappointed with the 'classic' film. (To be fair, though, the later cinematic renditions weren't any better, either.)I understand some of the filmmakers' decisions, like changing the ape society into a less advanced one, as the novel was practically unfilmable with the then available technology, but the oversimplification extended to the story and the characters, as well, and because of that little remained of the spirit of the book. The design and makeup of the gorillas are cool, Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter give fine performances, and the last scene (being a clever twist on the book's ending) is very effective and memorable, but overall the film feels cheap and shallow, at least compared with the book. It could have been much much better.For me, the third movie in the franchise, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, proved to be the most enjoyable. By basically turning the original story inside out while remaining faithful to both the plot and the spirit of Boulle's excellent novel, that is the one that got closest to the mark.

In a magnificent performance, Heston plays what he considers an "existential" character... He is a cynic who hates mankind enough to make him leave the Earth in search of "something better than man." Heston tries to make sense of this "upside-down" world, and in the process, Pierre Boulle raises such issues as balance of power, racism, the role of government, and evolution... The apes are seen with cameras and guns, but strangely, the sight of a paper airplane shocks them...Schaffner's ability to focus on the human element in the face of awesome spectacle is one of his greatest assets... He uses dizzying camera effects, very enthusiastic zooming and hand-held cameras at ground level during chases..."Planet of the Apes" is a magnificent visual experience, from the emerald lake at the beginning to the threatening sea-shore at the end... The desolate landscapes of the Utah and Arizona National Parks, represented into primeval ruins, make an appropriately setting for the first appearance of the talking apes, rounding up humans like animals... The apes themselves remain an astonishing achievement of make-up and performance... John Chambers receives an Academy Award for his art...The motion picture features one of Heston's strongest, most emotional performances... Heston escapes, fights and yells... He is violently treated, caged, dragged, and hosed with powerful jets of water... He runs barefoot through hills, mountains, plains and an ape city... He is raided by gorillas on foot and on horseback, humiliated by thoughtful chimpanzees and mad ape scientists, pelted by inhabitants of the Planet of the Apes...The terrific supporting cast is wholly convincing: Maurice Evans in the role of Zaius, the scientist who does not want his race to suffer the fate of the humans; the two friendly chimpanzees named Zira and Cornelius (Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall) are superb..."Planet of the Apes" also gives us something else:-Heston and his crewmen have landed on an unknown planet... They hear sounds of galloping horses and guns being fired... But what they see is incredible... Apes on horseback!"Bright Eyes" does surprise the apes who believe humans aren't capable... With those enraged words ("Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes!"), he shakes the entire foundation of ape society and causes the Semians to retreat in shock...The crucial scene where Taylor has been given a hearing: As he tries to explain to his captors that he's come from another planet in a spaceship, the scene cuts to the monkey tribunal - sitting in the classic "hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil, see-no-evil - pose...When a shaved Taylor kisses Zira in front of Cornelius who is suffering without complaining... An indecisive Zira expresses: "Allright. But you're so damned ugly!"The ultimate scene: Having finally escaped from his captors with his mate Nova (Linda Harrison), Heston rides along the beach on horseback to the Forbidden Zone, once a paradise... Suddenly he spots something unusual in the distance... He remembers what Zaius told him, "You may not like what you find!" What he can see was not a rock but salt-stained metal... As he draws closer, the camera slowly draws back and up to reveal what must come as a terrible shock... Backed by a magnificent and unusual Jerry Goldsmith musical score, "Planet of the Apes" is a stylish and thoughtful science fiction film, which starts and finishes splendidly... It is a superb exercise in fantasy, a fine suspense adventure, an exciting and provocative entertainment...

This known story is the first and best of the primates series; it starts when Taylor(recently deceased Charlton Heston) and three astronauts crash on a far planet and encounter a culture where the simians rule over. At the start they trek taken across the desert. Later discover humanity has gone awry and now is slave and reduced to beasts. Man is treated as animal of burden and regarded as scum. A couple of gorillas named Cornelius(Roddy McDowall) and Zira(Kim Hunter) think otherwise and even agree Taylor escape, accompanied by a gorgeous native named Nova(Linda Harrison). He's trapped and judged by Dr. Zaius(Maurice Evans) and the president of assembly(James Withmore).This is a classic sci-fi movie with metaphysical significance and reflexion about origin of human being, though also packs action, adventures, intrigue and entertainment. In spite of time, the original energy remains and results to be an agreeable fantasy. Exciting writing credits by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson from Pierre Boulle novel, though the amazing final scripted by Serling. One of the important attributes of this work, is the excellent, spectacular production design by Walter Scott. Glimmer and luminous cinematography by Leon Shamroy. Magnificent make-up by John Chambers, a first-rate expert, such as proved in 'Blade runner, Ssss, Island of Dr Moreau' among others. The picture is fabulously directed by Franklyn J Schaffner, utilizing a great visual sense. The film won two nominations for Academy Award, the best costume and sensational musical score by a top-notch Jerry Golsmith,- Schaffner's usual: Patton, Papillon-, and deservedly won Oscar for make-up by Chambers. Schaffner was an impressive director with hits : 'Boys from Brazil, Papillon, Patton, War lord', but also flops, : 'Lionheart, Island of streams, Nicholas and Alexandra and Sphinx'. Schaffner was one of the most innovate creative minds from the 70s and 80s.Followed by four inferior sequels and a TV series, as 'Beneath of the planet of apes'(70, Ted Post), 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes'(73, J.Lee Thompson).

In recent years sci-fi have been filled with flashing lights, high-budget CGI effects and ridiculous stunts like in THE MATRIX and I, ROBOT. If you don't like one sci-fi film you're unlikely to like any as they're all the same. However, my dad took down PLANET OF THE APES from our video shelf. Unlike most sci-fi films it was made in a time that had to deal without CGI and relied completely on the break through movie make-up as well as providing what people have voted time and time again "The Greatest Film Ending". PLANET OF THE APES has a memorable cast, simple plot and it keeps your attention even as the credits are rolling at the end. Based on Pierre Boulle's lesser novel (La Planète des singes AKA Monkey Planet) tells of an astronaut landing on a distant planet and discovering that man's role as the superior life form has been reversed with the apes. The film has many needed changes to it to make it more watch-able and tap into the true fears at the time the film was made. In 1968, everyone lived in fear of an atomic bomb attack and PLANET OF THE APES truly taps into that fear, for reasons I will not reveal but it is understandable why the story was so popular at the time and why it shocked everyone.PLANET OF THE APES tells the story of George Taylor (Charlton Heston), when he and his doomed astronaut friends find themselves stranded on a distant planet. It seems to be inhospitable with no life. However, after travelling throughout the place, which is famously referred to as "The Forbidden Zone", discover plenty of life including ape like humans and human like apes. Taylor is shot in the neck rendering him unable to speak. Treated as a wounded animal he is taken to a human-ape study lab where he meets Zira (Kim Hunter), a sympathetic and friendly chimpanzee. She almost straight away notices that Taylor's intelligence goes far beyond that of any other human, and she encourages him to speak. However, orangutan leader Dr Zaius sneers on Zira's and her fiancé Cornelius' (Roddy McDowall) belief in any human intelligence, and won't listen to reason. Despite Cornelius' skeptical feelings towards Taylor, he agrees to help prove his intelligence which is proved once he finally says his famous line: "Take your stinking paws of me you damn dirty ape!" Heston is anything other then a likable character. Unlike Ulysse Merou in the novel Taylor is slightly moody, but a likable character who values his friendship with Zira and Cornelius. He represents what humans truly are that is self-centered, violent and dangerous. Though on stage he is reportedly (according to Laurence Olivier) truly a talented actor, on screen and in PLANET OF THE APES, Heston basically turned up and played himself. Nonetheless the character of Taylor works as you either love him or you hate him. The rebel Taylor is no different from the other pushy characters Heston has played over the years. With his tough, physical god-like body you suppose that in a film where the apes are pushing us humans about because we're basically behaving like apes he is just what the doctor ordered.Of course we all know that it's the two lovable chimps Zira and Cornelius that we remember the most in the PLANET OF THE APES films for their charm and humor they bring to the story. Hunter's portrayal of Zira was a masterpiece on its own, giving one of the most powerful performances. It's fair to say that Zira is the strongest and most developed character in the film. Indeed she is the only ape that Taylor actually likes! With her wit and admirable sense of humor it's not surprising that most people asked who their favorite character is reply "Zira". Hunter manages to make Zira what she was meant to be, more human then ape. In fact, she's more human than most of the beautiful female actresses of the 60's films. Despite the fact she looks as ugly as hell in her ape make-up the charm still shines through.Of course, if you don't love the intelligent and cool Zira, you always have intelligent and nerdy Cornelius. McDowell, next to Heston, is the most celebrated male actor in the films as he comes over as the nerd of the rebel gang that you just want to hug. In the film, Taylor seems to have a love-hate rivalry with Cornelius as they constantly challenge each other like full-blooded males do no matter how civilized. A good example of this is when Zira allows Taylor to kiss her on the lips as a goodbye and Cornelius makes his jealousy clear. However Taylor sticks up for him against Zaius, which shows not as much friendship as understanding. McDowell is an irreplaceable member of the cast who is near impossible to live up to.PLANET OF THE APES is a mark in cinema history, famous for these talented artists, gripping story and an amazing ending that shocks you, scares you, breaks you and brings you to tears with the realization that you'll never truly experience a film like this again. Anyone who is anyone owes it to himself or herself to watch this film and experience the feeling. Even people who dislike sci-fi are likely to enjoy this. A film that truly did break STAR WARS and challenged it like no other film ever could. PLANET OF THE APES will live on in all of us. It will go on forever, find its way to younger audiences and will win them over just it won over us.

Absolutely incredible. Easily in my top 10 all time, and that's saying something. This movie kept me captivated from the beginning all the way to the end. It combined a super setting and effects (at least for '68) and the casting was perfect. This movie included, in my opinion, one of the most memorable line in film history, "get your damn paws of me, you stinkin' apes!". Not to ruin it for anyone, the ending is also one of the best in film history. This easily won my award for most entertaining and original story ever, because it captivated the imagination, especially considering the fact that it could actually happen (it's a stretch, but...) This is a rather short response, but I could just go on and on saying how great it was, but it would only be redundant. Overall, this movie was absolutely incredible9.5\10 stars (I'm a tough reviewer)

This is a splendid movie. Like other great horror-fantasy films (Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) it explores the relationship between humans and non-human beings. In "Planet of the Apes" there are only three animals: man, ape and horse and they play out their drama in this futuristic desert land. Unlike so many bad fantasy films, this one has a highly authentic aura around it. It is so utterly convincing like a story by H.P.Lovecraft or like one of your own nightmares and dreams. So strange, so fantastic! The words "The Forbidden Zone", I will never forget. The ending, of course, is so wonderfully eerie and shocking, one just gets goosebumps for hours. A child will never forget the experience of seeing this movie and she/he will learn so much about human relations with non-humans by witnessing this movie which explores the ethical theme with style and power. Such an utterly convincing fantasy film with a message of dream-like proportions are yet to be done better.

Planet of the Apes teaches us to take a closer look at ourselves. From the opening speech by Heston as astronaut Taylor all throughout the movie, we, as a human species, are simply given a mirror to watch ourselves. The apes simply tell a tale of ignorance and abuse. It's a mixture of ape science and religion, just like the real world, the human world we live in. In that respect this movie has not dated at all.Most mirror aspects are the 'in your face'-type. A more subtle one is right before the famous ending when the apes have dug up artifacts of a previous civilization that was more advanced than theirs. This finding is ridiculed by the apes eldest, the wise one. If anyone has ever looked into the aspects of alternative history 'the human kind', one will find out that the reaction of the apes eldest is typical of the human scientists in our every day lives. Anything contradicting their theories is ridiculed based on beliefs, never on scientific proof. Just because it is more convenient. The same comment is given by the elderly wise ape. He knew and has always known about the old civilizations, he just tried to hide it. Although Planet of the apes is rather slow in the mid section, Heston is great and this movie is thought provoking when you take all aspects into account, not just the obvious ones. Recommended, even today.

On a mission in space Charlton Heston and his crew get a fast forward courtesy of a 'time bend' and they wind up hundreds of years in the future. And on a planet where evolution has reversed a step. It's the apes that are the species created in the image of the Creator and humans are at best entertaining and at worse a lower form of animal that threatens the existence of Simian Civilization.As Heston so aptly puts it he thinks he's arrived in a mad house. Two simian scientists, Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowell have true scientific curiosity and want to know more about this human with articulate speech. But they answer to Maurice Evans who acts more like the high priest of simian religion and will do anything to protect the orthodoxy of his faith.Sounds familiar, doesn't it? As is true in human religions on earth, those in charge have power over the true believers and will do anything to protect their privileged position. The apes haven't done anything different, it's what is driving Charlton Heston quite out of his mind.My favorite in this film is Maurice Evans and seeing him in that orangutan costume and makeup and hearing that classically trained voice come from same is a treat that keeps on treating every time you see this film and the sequel films that he did appear in. Today's audience cannot appreciate the familiar voices of people like Evans, McDowell, Hunter, James Whitmore and James Daly who are in ape costume, but even so the makeup remains a marvel.In fact it got Planet Of The Apes its only Oscar and well deserved. In the past you simply would put some actor in a gorilla costume in some B and lower grade feature, but it was never convincing. The actors here look like simians and must have rehearsed for weeks to get simian movements down as well as they do.In the end Heston goes off to meet his destiny and the destiny that met mankind while he was asleep and time bended. Planet Of The Apes is as fresh as it was when it arrived on the big screen in 1968 and with a lot of the same lessons to be learned.

I hadn't watched "Planet of the Apes" for a very long while. With the impending release of the 2001 version of the film, I decided to take another look at this old classic.I think anyone who hasn't seen "Planet of the Apes", will enjoy this film. The premise of future earth being dominated by "intelligent" apes makes for an interesting story. Coupled to this, are some excellent locations, decent performances and a neat ending.If, however you were looking for a scientifically rational, well scripted epic, better look elsewhere. "Planet of the Apes" script is filled with more holes than a swiss cheese.I was wondering why anyone would send a character like "Taylor" on a space mission. Was he supposed to be an astronaut? a scientist? or just a big boorish bully-boy. As the three scientists explore their new planet home, what do they do when they finally come across the first sign of life (a bush). They dig it up of course! I was also amazed at how nonchalant they all were when they came across the ape totems. I would expect an intelligent person, upon confirming the existence of other intelligent life, would display some appropriate measure of surprise and wonder (even fear).But it was all taken in stride by the characters in this film. Disappointing and unrealistic.There are many more anomalies, which spoilt the experience for me. More often than not, I found myself laughing while watching, and I don't think this was the intended response the director was looking for."Planet of the Apes" is a light-weight enjoyable, entertaining film. Just don't think about it too deeply.7/10

Apart from the cheesy ape prosthetics, this was a nearly perfect sci-fi movie that had absolutely no reason to remake it other than to make a fast buck! Nothing about the remake can beat many of the wonderful lines or scenes from the movie. Taylor yelling "Get your hands off me, do damned, dirty apes!" and "This is a MADHOUSE---a MADHOUSE!!" are classic lines and I also love the scene during Taylor's trial when the orangutans are sitting in the SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL poses! These are some of the greatest moments in film history and yet some moron wants a remake?!? The movie, despite having several writers come and go (including Rod Serling), is well scripted, directed and who could have done a better job than Charleton Heston or Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter? The film is creative, energetic and concludes with one of the most visually impressive scenes in sci-fi history. All these combine for a great film. PERIOD!

Somewhat dated and dumb. The sets,costumes, and make up aren't even state of the art for 1968. In the same year, Kubrick's "2001" had actors playing apes more convincingly, and "Barbarella" had more interesting sets. Some of the exterior sets in "Planet of the Apes" looked like they were influenced by the "Flinstones".A clever premise has not been developed with interesting or convincing details. The script is uneven ,contains inconsistencies, and lacks a strong conflict and point of view. And except for Kim Hunter, you don't necessarily care about the characters. Heston seems a bit long in the tooth to be an astronaut. And these astronauts of the future are none too bright. Wouldn't Heston and crew have looked at the sun, the atmosphere, and the topography, and realized that they were back on earth? Can you say Utah? And wouldn't they have guarded their only possessions (clothes and backpacks) more carefully? I'm assuming their backpakcks contained something necessary and useful for their survival and protection.And it's never made clear what the apes plan to do with the humans. Why don't they lobotomize Heston as they did "Landon"? Why shoot Heston, and then nurse him back to health? Especially since he represents a truth the elders want to suppress. And in this ape society, who's in charge? The apes seem brutal at first, and then benign, like Disney characters. And is there a munitions factory somewhere on this planet? Where do they get their guns and amunition? And could the Statue of Liberty remain intact after the destruction of the world?Franklin Schaffner uses space and geography imaginatively. Some of the situations are interesting, and the dialogue is sometimes clever and witty. The film begins slowly, and too much time is wasted on scenes of the apes refusing to acknowledge or deal with the obvious;that Taylor is an intelligent being. Overall, it's reasonably entertaining and worth a look. Not a film that can stand repeated viewings or scrutiny. If you like "Planet of the Apes", try John Boorman's "Zardoz"(1974) which is weirder, more imaginative, and intense.

Apes have been around longer than man. Why would they suddenly develop intelligence equal to humans? And at the end Heston sees the Statue of Liberty and realizes he's on Earth all along. Wouldn't the fact that the apes speak English be enough of a clue or did he think it was just an incredible coincidence that apes on another planet spoke English? Why all the downvotes? You know I'm right
