this film is ridiculously unbelievable, thin on plot, shamefully predictable, historically inaccurate in so many ways...yet it all works! The combination of modern music to medieval setting should be awful, but no, it works! The costumes are totally wrong for the period (on purpose I'd hazard to guess - at one point Angelina Jolie lookalike Shannyn Sossamon is wearing a hat & dress outfit that looks startlingly similar to a costume Julia Roberts wore in Pretty Woman...) but it works! Heath Ledger is an Aussie (what happened to the black hair he had in 10 Things I Hate About You! I didn't recognize him!) and Alan Tudyk is a Texan, so their accents should have tanked! But they didn't, just a few slippages a la Mel Gibson in Braveheart or Jonny Lee Miller in Hackers...This film is funny, fast-paced (certainly didn't *feel* over 2h...), well constructed, hilariously tongue-in-cheek (From the We Will Rock You opening scene to the Nike swooshes on the armor I couldn't stop laughing!) It certainly has its problems (including some *horribly* cheezy lines - most on purpose but that doesn't make them any less horrible! and an evil Hollywood ending - including a Bravheart-like scream of defiance in the final joust that made me cringe...) but those problems are overcome by sharp wit and consistent amusement. The actors were obviously enjoying themselves, and the action was beautifully blended in with the rest of the film. None of the jousting scenes were too long (like, say, the race in Phantom Menace...) and all were shot in such a way as to make them really exciting!And I have to laud Paul Bettany who was an incredible and incredibly amusing Geoffrey Chaucer...even though he looks eerily similar, IMO, to Thom Yorke...)Kudos to anyone who recognizes Laura Fraser (the blacksmith) from Man in the Iron Mask...Overall: A great watch. I went in expecting little and came out extremely satisfied. Not the best film of its kind, but a head above most. And the blending of contemporary style and music and characterization with the medieval story/setting is really well done. It really shouldn't but it does work! 7/10.

This wonderfully uplifting little film has a great big heart, good humor, and a classic message about love and honor, and the rarity and preciousness of those who practice both with style. I went to see this with my spouse and a good friend of ours because THEY (the spouse and the friend) wanted to see it. I am a non-fan of comedies, and had been annoyed by the stream of trashy Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court films that had been coming out since the 1980s. My spouse had also informed me that I would be seeing Jousting performed to Bachman Turner Overdrive. My reaction was to reach for the nearest bottle of hard liquor. I didn't need it.I've now seen this film about six times, and though I can't say that I see something new in it every time (it's just not that complicated), I can say that I have enjoyed it each and every time. The characters, though relatively uncomplicated, are very lovable and the casting is quite excellent all around. Before Brokeback Mountain, William Thatcher was Heath Ledger's most memorable role. He's a poor boy from London's Cheapside who wants to change his stars and to become an honored knight. Travelling from tournament to tournament with his fellow indentured servants, his liege passes on, and William seizes the moment - taking his armor and his horse to become Sir Ulrich Von Liechtenstein of the Gelderland. He is joined by the other now-free indentures, and eventually, by Chaucer and a female Farrier played by the wonderful Laura Fraser. Eventually, William falls in love with a princess and is challenged by a rival for her affections with a lot more experience, money and political clout. The love story, which could have easily become a distracting annoyance, in fact, comes to dominate and drive the story very nicely.Special kudos to Ledger, Alan Tudyk, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany and James Purefoy for their awesome performances. And extra special kudos to Director Brian Helgeland for pulling off an impossible task - taking a fairy tale, making us want to believe it, and yet retaining some wonderful elements of silliness often missing in the fairy tale genre. This would make a wonderful romantic living-room double feature with The Princess Bride.Recommendation: Definitely worth seeing.

A story about jousting but this old knight's tale is anything but old because it mixes in satire of today's modern sports-audience age with some funny bits. Those include the overly dramatic public address announcer (boy, that's even more so since this film came out), rock music blaring out as the contestants do battle, etc.The main characters are nicely varied with distinct personalities. Shannon Sossamon, however, was not quite up to leading-lady status and hasn't had a choice role like this since, either. I would have rather seen her "assistant" in this film, or the blacksmith woman, be the lead. Anyway, even though it's a bit long at 132 minutes, it's still entertaining most of the way, with some of the funniest bits at the beginning. However, it's just as much a romance (with Heath Ledger as the male lead) than a comedy.What also is good is the sound and visuals in here: all high-class. The lance hitting an opponent made an interesting sound each time. The surround sound in here was good, too. It's a film most people would like, and I recommend seeing it.

I'd read that Brian Helgeland had been soured by the movie industry due to his mistreatment on his film, "Payback." I use "his film" in the most liberal sense here, as star Mel Gibson wrestled control of the film from Helgeland and imposed his own view on the final editing process. With this situation in mind, I fully expected "A Knight's Tale" to be a creative response to that negative filmmaking experience, a fun and free film that thumbed its nose at tradition and set style and which allowed the director's true vision to shine through with no outside interference. And my friends, that's exactly what I got when I first sat down to watch in back in 2001. "A Knight's Tale" celebrates the classic and vastly misused/underused genre of medieval movies, while at the same time knocking the genre on its ear by instilling the film with modern themes, attitudes and a classic rock score. Sadly, it was these elements which repelled most viewers and led to "A Knight's Tale's" lackluster performance at the box office. Were these people just a little more open minded, they would have allowed themselves a wonderful movie-going experience that celebrates individuality, love, and above all else, friendship. Though the music is crucial to the uniqueness of this film (and a brilliant addition, I might add), it's the relationships amongst the characters that gives this film its heart. William and Jocelyn are the perfect couple: bickering, floundering, and absolutely in love with one another. Wat, Roland, Kate and Geoff, wonderful characters unwilling to be fopped off as simple comic reliefs, show genuine love and loyalty to William, and do as much to contribute and carry the story along as William and the other two leads accomplish. Count Adamar, the film's villain, is a wonderful foil for William. He is cunning and cruel, and even in his moments of defeat, a character to respect. In many cases, such a villain would be made to seem wimpy or, at his moment of defeat, clumsy. Not so here, as Adamar is, throughout the film, a force to be reckoned with. I suppose part of why I love "A Knight's Tale" is my ability to relate to it so personally. I've certainly had my share of challenges, and aspired to be more than what I currently was. And I've also known friendships so loyal and loving that fiction could never invent. Most significantly, I've lived the pursuit of true love and, like William, have obtained it with no small amount of satisfaction. Everyone to some degree or another has also had these experiences in their lives, and its these experiences that built the foundation of "A Knight's Tale," which is exactly what makes it such a wonderful film, more than worthy of a second chance by those who previously doubted it, and much more than worthy of a spot in any fan's movie collection.

Fun little tale of a dirt poor lad willing to go all out for his lady love, his honor, and to prove he is as good as any other warrior. Plenty of laughs from a zany character or two and a grand adventure with plenty of old world jousting, pageantry, and costumes. Loved the way the producers wove hard rock tunes and today's lingo into the show's fabric and made it seem, usually anyway, as thought it fit that time span. Cool flic.

Brian Helgeland's A Knight's Tale is a hugely entertaining medieval romp set to modern rock classics such as Queen's 'We Will Rock You' and Thin Lizzy's 'The Boys are Back in Town'. The movie urges you to join in the fun with recognisable songs that is a jarring juxtaposition to the 14th century goings on at first but you soon get used to the idea.Heath Ledger is excellent as the peasant who wants to be a knight and, upon meeting a homeless writer, who turns out to be Chaucer, offers to forge papers so that Ledger can bluff his way into the annual jousting competition to prove his worth as a knight and finds romance along the way.This film has everything - action, adventure, comedy, romance and rock songs. It's feel good entertainment and Helgeland's unique approach still feels fresh, sassy and on point. Ledger is surrounded by a good supporting cast of Paul Bettany, Rufus Sewell, Mark Addy, Shannyn Sossamon and James Purefoy.It's the perfect mix of a smart witty script, solid acting and an off kilter approach that really works. Baz Luhrmann pulled a similar trick with both Romeo & Juliet (1996) and Moulin Rouge (2001) by mixing up period pieces with modern songs to serve the narrative in an unconventional way.

I first saw "A Knight's Tale" by chance.  A few of us had decided on an ad hoc visit to the local cinema and selected "A Knight's Tale" simply because it sounded the least "teen" movie on the bill.  We slapped down our cash and took our seats.The movie began...A crowd of peasants are assembled to watch the jousting.  And they're singing "We Will Rock You."My initial response was "God, this is going to be bad."But as the movie continued, it suddenly dawned on me - I wasn't hating the movie at all!  On an intellectual level, I should have been booing and throwing stuff at the screen but there's something about the sheer verve and energy of "A Knight's Tale" that just drags you in on an emotional level.
A clever script with many modern references, a good cast of likeable characters and a fantastic soundtrack (the reveal of "Golden Years" is particularly good) all add up to make "A Knight's Tale" one of the most entertaining mainstream movies I've seen in a long time.Normally I hate "popcorn" movies - not because I consider them "low brow" or an insult to the intelligence, but because they're shallow, tired and lack soul.  Yet "A Knight's Tale" is different.  No, it won't change your life and it won't make you ponder your place in the universe.  But it will entertain you.If you're looking for an "old fashioned" good vs. evil movie with a twist, or your copy of "The Princess Bride" is wearing thin, check out "A Knight's Tale."8/10

I watched this movies in my high school social's class. We were doing a unit on knights, and i was ready to pull my out my iPod to spend a class playing clash of clans, but the intro immediately caught my attention because the production levels seemed quite good.The movie was great, although character depth could've been better. A lot of weird characters coming out at random times, got me a bit confused. The ending seemed a bit stretched out and haphazard, but i still enjoyed it.Heath ledger was fantastic once again, and i really appreciated how this wasn't all about love. Very underrated, thoroughly enjoyed!

But it is mine.All HUGE heart, loyal friendship and REAL character WITH real characters. And a whole lot of fun and good laughs.Just, love it for what it is.

Why do so many people think this film isn't very good? Because they think it is historically incorrect? Do they not realise this is a comedy? I'm pretty sure that when Brian Helgeland wrote this film he knew that the song 'We Will Rock You' hadn't been released 400 years ago. I'm also sure he knew Nike hadn'd been founded yet. I think people are missing the point, because they thought it was going to be a film like Braveheart. A Knight's Tale is a story which is set in medieval times, and as a JOKE, they have mixed in things that weren't around at that time, such as the Nike sign, and Ulrich being introduced by Chaucer before his matches.The story is predictable, but in my view that doesn't really matter in a comedy if it makes you laugh on the way. Overall, I though this was a very good film, and I would recommend it to anyone willing to not take it seriously.8/10

Heath Ledger is Will, a peasant who dreams of being a glorious and great Knight. After the death of his master Will takes on the identity of Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein and enters a tournament were he finds love, friendship and a sense of identity.I'm a little late...well years late at reviewing this but its one of those films you like but never get around to reviewing...I watched this and found it to be quite funny and thrilling. Heath Ledger provides a great performance about a young man striving to grab his dreams and make them a reality, but prevented by rich snobbery. Paul Bettany is marvellous providing the adrenaline pumper that excites the crowd and drives their cheers across the country. His words sway the audience into bettering their English.... and I love his remarks towards the angry Wat.Brilliant feel good movie that drives you to obtain your dreams in one fell swoop.

OK, no-one in his right mind will believe this is a historically correct movie. The world tournament games in London, pop-hair make-up, dancing on bowie's golden years, hahaha. There is not much that should be taken too seriously and because it is so clear this movie does not pretend to be historically correct it simply works well. It is written by someone who probably had a lot of fun doing so. All the actors clearly also have fun with the role they are playing and all together is movie is just fun to watch. It is regularly shown on TV and each time again I start with thinking, no lets not watch it but somehow always end up watching it and each time with fun.It is a movie that will never stand-out or get a real cult following, but it is good for an evening feel-good entertainment. Watch and enjoy

Having read the almost universally positive reviews of this film, I, at the very least, expected passable popcorn entertainment. That is not what I received. I left unsatisfied at what I had just paid £ 5.25 to see.I don't think my expectations were especially high - just 2 hours of mindless fun.Instead I found A Knight's Tale boring, repetitive and downright silly. The jousting scenes - surely an integral part of the film - seemed like more of the same each time, and the supposed 'love' interest was about as interesting as a cardboard cutout.There are a few laughs to be had, and some of the in - jokes and references are amusing, but overall, this is unremarkable, and not a patch on the best blockbusters.4/10

if you looking for historical accuracy, for solid Medieval drama, for dramatic scenes and for old fashion historical movies, this is the worst choice. if you like an eccentric cocktail of modern music and Medieval pretext, easy story and Heath Lodger in a good role, this is a must see. because it is real seductive against it. predictable but nice. hilarious , unrealistic and chaotic. a sort of teenager game. but great in a way who has not exactly definition. because it is the sort of film for fun who could be reasonable kick to discover the truth about a period who, in this film, remains only a generous sketch.

Wow, A Knight's Tale has over 650 user reviews!!! Such is the testimony of this fine movie that is directed by Brian Helgeland, who also wrote the screenplay for Nightmare on Elm Street 4. One standout performance in my humble opinion is Nick Brimble as Sir Ector. I first saw Mr Brimble as the Prime Minister's security head in House of Cards (the original British one) and he has to be one of the most underrated British actors of our generation. His scene in A Knight's Tale where he takes on a young William Thatcher is a masterclass in acting. It needs to be shown to all aspiring actors, now!

While there are some cheesy parts in the script and Shannyn Sossamon while beautiful with a magical smile not quite convincing as the fickle love interest, there is a lot to enjoy. There is constant wit and energy, and the soundtrack is marvellous. The opening scene with We Will Rock You brought the house down when I watched it with my family, and that scene was one of the more exhilarating moments in the film. The dialogue is modern, but there are some flashes of authenticity. One of two of them come across as cheesy but others work surprisingly well. There is a lot going on in the story, sometimes this can be a problem, with the length the film is at nearly two and a quarter hours, my feelings were mixed here. The side story about William's blind father was touching, but for my liking there were too many jousting matches. I will say the acting is very good, with Heath Ledger dashing, Rufus Sewell seedy as the Count and Paul Bettany stealing the show in a wonderfully comic turn as Geoffrey Chaucer. Overall, entertaining and fun, doesn't always work but I liked it. 7/10 Bethany Cox

A Knight's Tale is an entertaining action adventure. It may not be the best movie ever made but it's still pretty good. Director Brian Helgeland does an admirable job of making this movie about a peasant squire who creates a new identity for himself as a knight after the death of his master. The late Heath Ledger is excellent as William Thatcher the peasant who becomes a knight. Ledger showed in all the films he's been in his talent and this one is no different. R.I.P. Ledger. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Mark Addy, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany, Alan Tudyk, and Shannyn Sossaman. The movie has plenty of action and fights that are well executed with some small does of humor. Also worth mentioning Ledger, Addy, Bettany, and Tudyk had great chemistry together making their friendships believable. They brought much of the comic relief to the movie as well. Ledger also had a good chemistry with Sossman who was impressive as his love interest. Rufus Sewell was a solid villain but he wasn't given much to do except for a few action sequences. The pacing was a little slow at times making it feel a little long. The final confrontation between Ledger and Sewell was fitting it was a bit of a letdown. With it's flaws aside though A Knight's Tale is still a solid adventure with just enough action, humor, a little romance, and exceptional performances by the cast especially Ledger who make this movie worth the time to watch.

The first time I saw A Knight's Tale (on cable, missed it in theater), I had the same reaction as many of you - Queen? David Bowie? In a movie set in the middle ages?But I stayed with it, and I'm glad I did. Once you get past the glaring anachronisms (put in the film on purpose, of course), you find the movie is actually quite true to its period.The presence of Chaucer in the film, combined with some of its details, leads me to suspect that Brian Helgeland has read "Chaucer's Knight" by fellow filmmaker Terry Jones (of Monty Python fame). The book deconstructs the knight in Chaucer's "The Knight's Tale" in a totally unique way -- he is seen NOT as the flower of medieval chivalry (as most scholars have interpreted him), but as a mercenary out for nothing but money and blood. The character in the film Chaucer would have written about, then, is not Sir William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), but Count Adhemar of Anjou (Rufus Sewell).The part of the film in which this connection "clicked" for me was the scene where Count Adhemar is called away to his command in a "Free Company" -- a particular stain on the reputation of knighthood which Jones talks extensively about in his book.Jones' book made use of extensive research into medieval history, and Helgeland's film obviously does, too.Chaucer was a master of satire in his day. Helgeland's use of modern conventions in a period film is a conceit of which - I believe - Chaucer would definitely have approved.I gave "A Knight's Tale" 9 out of 10 - it's not perfect, but I like it so much, I try to watch it every time it comes on (it's been on HBO and Cinemax pretty regularly for the past several months). Check it out!

Brian Helgeland's "A Knight's Tale" is a medieval adventure story with a twist. Heath Ledger plays a peasant who assumes the identity of a nobleman in order to compete as a jouster. The twist is that anachronistic elements are purposely introduced into the movie in order to give it a flavour not unlike a contemporary sports movie.This approach is perhaps most apparent in the classic rock soundtrack that features well chosen tracks from the likes of Queen, Thin Lizzy & Sly and the Family Stone. The dialogue is also a successful mixture of period and modern English. The costuming also employs an intriguing mixture of old and new styles.The liberties taken with history may rub some viewers the wrong way but I think that they set the movie apart from the many others that are set in the same time-frame. Helgeland's script also incorporates Geoffrey Chaucer as a character, which is a nice touch. I feel that the movie may not capitalize on its unique approach to the fullest extent but the story is generally enjoyable, so it isn't a major problem.Though the movie was mainly a starring vehicle for Heath Ledger the supporting cast was obviously assembled with care. Ledger's band of merry men includes Alan Tudyk, Mark Addy and Paul Bettany, fine actors all. Rufus Sewell is effective as the villain of the piece while James Purefoy makes a welcome appearance as well. Female lead Shannyn Sossamon is a bit of weak link as far as I'm concerned but her maid is pre-"The Artist" Berenice Bejo.Visually, the movie is attractive, if not especially so. Helgeland's strength lies in writing (as evidenced by his Oscar for "L.A. Confidential") but his directorial skills are not to be dismissed. Musically, the movie's soundtrack is nicely chosen while the supporting score is functional without making much of an impression.Overall, "A Knight's Tale" proves to be an enjoyable period movie enlivened by some modern touches. The presentation may be more adventurous than the story itself but the movie ably fulfils its function as light entertainment.

This comment is to counter those who have issue with modern rock and other time problems being in this movie. This movie was designed to entertain. It was NOT a historical piece and nowhere does it claim to be one. This is the story of a boy who aspires to be more than what society set out for him. The movie uses odd references to history's great figures and humor to bring its story across to the viewer. So I say that, for those of you who cannot enjoy a piece of entertainment due to its well placed use of anachronisms, I strongly suggest you stay away from any of Shakespeare's works. (Not to say that this movie was on level with Shakespeare...) The makers of "A Knight's Tale" set out to entertain, and did so dutifully.

I'm into history and this is one of my favorite eras. Although this movie is hardly historically accurate, nor does it try to be, it does achieve the stereotype of British royalty wannabees, which I find delightful.I don't care for the rock music in the movie at all, I love rock music but it does have it's place. The music does make an effort to reach viewers who might otherwise not be interested in movies with an historic aspect.Heath Ledger and Alan Tudyk are both quite handsome, good choices for the leads. Together with diverse actor Mark Addy they make a most believable team, all three filled with interesting personalities and character.I understand that this was not supposed to be an historic fashion statement, but Jocelyn's clothes fell short of looking even remotely period, more like out of place. I preferred the worn out rags on the men to the fancy 1960s looking elegant fashionwear.Rufus Sewell played the antagonist quite well, regal and handsome, delightfully evil, yet had to be shown his place.I find this movie fun to watch, and in spite of it's drawbacks I keep coming back for more!

As soon as I saw the fans singing and clapping to "We Will Rock You" I thought "this is not very realistic".  Of course, that was when I had gone in expecting a film like Braveheart or The Patriot, with real historical lessons.  A Knight's Tale was nothing like either of those. After you get past the first one or two scenes, everything really grows on you.  The humor is, yes, cheesy at times, (the Nike armor) but I still laughed.  Chaucer was great, the villain was definitely evil, and the jousting/action scenes were very well done.  Put all that together with some other funny sidekicks and a little romance and you've got a pretty good flick.  Definitely a must see more than once, and a must buy video/DVD when it's out!

I didn't know what to expect, but I really loved this cast and the soundtrack. This is what you call pure fun. Tudyk and Bettany are such a great addition and Heath Ledger has one of those faces you just can't resist. I am glad I finally got to watch this!

Everything about `A Knight's Tale' is shamelessly designed to pander the masses.  Writer/director Brian Helgeland, who scored big with `L.A. Confidential' has followed that excellent effort with a succession of progressively worse screenplays (`Conspiracy Theory', `The Postman', `Payback') culminating in this charming but trite puff piece.The pity is that the story had possibilities.  A squire seizes upon the opportune death of his knight to enter a jousting competition and ultimately, albeit illegitimately, establish himself as a top competitor. William/Ulrich (Heath Ledger) begins the film with no skills whatever and with the help of his hapless lads, miraculously is transformed into a lean mean jousting machine.  He is then thunderstruck by the utterly bland Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) and spends the rest of the film trying to win her love.  Meanwhile Kate (Laura Fraser), the only interesting female character, with excellent potential for an intriguing romantic entanglement, is relegated to becoming William's groupie.  Despite good potential for a serious medieval drama, Helgeland decides that it should follow a rutted and unimaginative formula so that it will appeal to all those millions who have loved this same story in different forms countless times before.  As if that isn't enough, he further debases it by filling it with anachronistic contemporary dialogue (`Oh Wow', `Helllllloooo', `Foxy Lady', etc.) and rock music to which all the medieval peasants join in to sing along and boogie.  This wouldn't be so bad if the film was constructed to be a spoof, but after each of these absurd digressions, Helgeland switches back into drama mode, asking us once again to take his characters seriously.Helgeland can't seem to decide whether he wants this to be a farce, a send up, or a serious drama.  It is all out of sync.  The film is funny when it is trying to be serious and dull when it is trying to be funny.  I don't even want to get into how historically unrealistic his depiction of medieval Europe is.  The only redeeming quality of Helgeland's direction is the stunt work on the jousting scenes.  The jousting is brilliantly done and (of course) unabashedly overused.  After a couple of dozen broken lances, it is hard to get up for the final match between William and the evil Count Adhemar as all the spectacle has been wrung out.  It would be like having 25 chariot races in Ben-Hur and asking us to be excited about the 26th race against Messala.Heath Ledger is airy and adorable as William, qualities I know I always associate with medieval knights (sarcasm intended).  Ledger plays the part with such lack of force that it is difficult to believe the rushing wind didn't knock him off his horse long before the opponent's lance hit the mark.  Shannyn Sossamon is pretty, but equally mind-numbing.  Their romance has all the heft of balsa wood and all the maturity of a date to the Junior Prom.Paul Bettany steals what is left of the show with his spirited portrayal of Chaucer.  Bettany provides us with a most remarkable interpretation of the celebrated author, whipping the crowds into frenzy with his commanding introductions.  Rufus Sewell is a passable villain, but comes across more obnoxious than despicable.Overall, this film is so utterly insubstantial and obsequious to the masses that it had to be a hit.  This is another typical Hollywood cotton candy film, sweet with no substance.  It is charming, light, and predicable, giving everyone exactly what they want and expect.  I rated it a 4/10 including a point for the great stunt work.  Serious filmgoers are cautioned to lower their expectations.

this film is ridiculously unbelievable, thin on plot, shamefully predictable, historically inaccurate in so many ways...yet it all works! The combination of modern music to medieval setting should be awful, but no, it works! The costumes are totally wrong for the period (on purpose I'd hazard to guess - at one point Angelina Jolie lookalike Shannyn Sossamon is wearing a hat & dress outfit that looks startlingly similar to a costume Julia Roberts wore in Pretty Woman...) but it works! Heath Ledger is an Aussie (what happened to the black hair he had in 10 Things I Hate About You! I didn't recognize him!) and Alan Tudyk is a Texan, so their accents should have tanked! But they didn't, just a few slippages a la Mel Gibson in Braveheart or Jonny Lee Miller in Hackers...This film is funny, fast-paced (certainly didn't *feel* over 2h...), well constructed, hilariously tongue-in-cheek (From the We Will Rock You opening scene to the Nike swooshes on the armor I couldn't stop laughing!) It certainly has its problems (including some *horribly* cheezy lines - most on purpose but that doesn't make them any less horrible! and an evil Hollywood ending - including a Bravheart-like scream of defiance in the final joust that made me cringe...) but those problems are overcome by sharp wit and consistent amusement. The actors were obviously enjoying themselves, and the action was beautifully blended in with the rest of the film. None of the jousting scenes were too long (like, say, the race in Phantom Menace...) and all were shot in such a way as to make them really exciting!And I have to laud Paul Bettany who was an incredible and incredibly amusing Geoffrey Chaucer...even though he looks eerily similar, IMO, to Thom Yorke...)Kudos to anyone who recognizes Laura Fraser (the blacksmith) from Man in the Iron Mask...Overall: A great watch. I went in expecting little and came out extremely satisfied. Not the best film of its kind, but a head above most. And the blending of contemporary style and music and characterization with the medieval story/setting is really well done. It really shouldn't but it does work! 7/10.

This film shows without any quibbling just how bright the star of Heath Ledger was. He is luminous in this; beautiful, funny, physical and engaging. He plays excellently against the stunning Shannyn Sossamon, who fits perfectly into the modern medieval setting of this film. Set in the C14th a man of poor birth but sharp intellect rises through the ranks of page-dom with the desire to become a nobleman for food, fame, glory and love.An impressive ensemble cast including the superior Paul Bettany (Chaucer - you can see he had fun with this rather exposing (!) role), Rufus Sewell, Mark Addy, Christopher Cazenove, James Purefoy and Alan Tudyk provides a film that is nigh-on flawless for cinematography that is exciting and gripping, the screenplay - the script - is amazing, laugh out loud funny all the way through. It's one of those films which require certain intelligence to get all the asides and witticisms, or numerous viewings to pick up on all of them, otherwise its still a funny and enjoyable film. With something for everyone this film is a joy to watch again and again, it's also attractive visually - many points to the costumers who mixed historical fashion with a modern edgy almost punk twist. Ditto the soundtrack - mixing in modern music was a clever touch, similar to Romeo and Juliet (Baz Luhrmann), and also an interesting look at fame and the cult of celebrity. A great viewing experience which sometimes even brings a tear to my eye. If you don't enjoy this film, there's something wrong with you. Ignore the haters, it's not supposed to be historically accurate or high-brow! Sometimes a feel-good, comfortable, Disney-esque story arc is just what you want.

This wonderfully uplifting little film has a great big heart, good humor, and a classic message about love and honor, and the rarity and preciousness of those who practice both with style. I went to see this with my spouse and a good friend of ours because THEY (the spouse and the friend) wanted to see it. I am a non-fan of comedies, and had been annoyed by the stream of trashy Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court films that had been coming out since the 1980s. My spouse had also informed me that I would be seeing Jousting performed to Bachman Turner Overdrive. My reaction was to reach for the nearest bottle of hard liquor. I didn't need it.I've now seen this film about six times, and though I can't say that I see something new in it every time (it's just not that complicated), I can say that I have enjoyed it each and every time. The characters, though relatively uncomplicated, are very lovable and the casting is quite excellent all around. Before Brokeback Mountain, William Thatcher was Heath Ledger's most memorable role. He's a poor boy from London's Cheapside who wants to change his stars and to become an honored knight. Travelling from tournament to tournament with his fellow indentured servants, his liege passes on, and William seizes the moment - taking his armor and his horse to become Sir Ulrich Von Liechtenstein of the Gelderland. He is joined by the other now-free indentures, and eventually, by Chaucer and a female Farrier played by the wonderful Laura Fraser. Eventually, William falls in love with a princess and is challenged by a rival for her affections with a lot more experience, money and political clout. The love story, which could have easily become a distracting annoyance, in fact, comes to dominate and drive the story very nicely.Special kudos to Ledger, Alan Tudyk, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany and James Purefoy for their awesome performances. And extra special kudos to Director Brian Helgeland for pulling off an impossible task - taking a fairy tale, making us want to believe it, and yet retaining some wonderful elements of silliness often missing in the fairy tale genre. This would make a wonderful romantic living-room double feature with The Princess Bride.Recommendation: Definitely worth seeing.

A story about jousting but this old knight's tale is anything but old because it mixes in satire of today's modern sports-audience age with some funny bits. Those include the overly dramatic public address announcer (boy, that's even more so since this film came out), rock music blaring out as the contestants do battle, etc.The main characters are nicely varied with distinct personalities. Shannon Sossamon, however, was not quite up to leading-lady status and hasn't had a choice role like this since, either. I would have rather seen her "assistant" in this film, or the blacksmith woman, be the lead. Anyway, even though it's a bit long at 132 minutes, it's still entertaining most of the way, with some of the funniest bits at the beginning. However, it's just as much a romance (with Heath Ledger as the male lead) than a comedy.What also is good is the sound and visuals in here: all high-class. The lance hitting an opponent made an interesting sound each time. The surround sound in here was good, too. It's a film most people would like, and I recommend seeing it.

I'd read that Brian Helgeland had been soured by the movie industry due to his mistreatment on his film, "Payback." I use "his film" in the most liberal sense here, as star Mel Gibson wrestled control of the film from Helgeland and imposed his own view on the final editing process. With this situation in mind, I fully expected "A Knight's Tale" to be a creative response to that negative filmmaking experience, a fun and free film that thumbed its nose at tradition and set style and which allowed the director's true vision to shine through with no outside interference. And my friends, that's exactly what I got when I first sat down to watch in back in 2001. "A Knight's Tale" celebrates the classic and vastly misused/underused genre of medieval movies, while at the same time knocking the genre on its ear by instilling the film with modern themes, attitudes and a classic rock score. Sadly, it was these elements which repelled most viewers and led to "A Knight's Tale's" lackluster performance at the box office. Were these people just a little more open minded, they would have allowed themselves a wonderful movie-going experience that celebrates individuality, love, and above all else, friendship. Though the music is crucial to the uniqueness of this film (and a brilliant addition, I might add), it's the relationships amongst the characters that gives this film its heart. William and Jocelyn are the perfect couple: bickering, floundering, and absolutely in love with one another. Wat, Roland, Kate and Geoff, wonderful characters unwilling to be fopped off as simple comic reliefs, show genuine love and loyalty to William, and do as much to contribute and carry the story along as William and the other two leads accomplish. Count Adamar, the film's villain, is a wonderful foil for William. He is cunning and cruel, and even in his moments of defeat, a character to respect. In many cases, such a villain would be made to seem wimpy or, at his moment of defeat, clumsy. Not so here, as Adamar is, throughout the film, a force to be reckoned with. I suppose part of why I love "A Knight's Tale" is my ability to relate to it so personally. I've certainly had my share of challenges, and aspired to be more than what I currently was. And I've also known friendships so loyal and loving that fiction could never invent. Most significantly, I've lived the pursuit of true love and, like William, have obtained it with no small amount of satisfaction. Everyone to some degree or another has also had these experiences in their lives, and its these experiences that built the foundation of "A Knight's Tale," which is exactly what makes it such a wonderful film, more than worthy of a second chance by those who previously doubted it, and much more than worthy of a spot in any fan's movie collection.

Fun little tale of a dirt poor lad willing to go all out for his lady love, his honor, and to prove he is as good as any other warrior. Plenty of laughs from a zany character or two and a grand adventure with plenty of old world jousting, pageantry, and costumes. Loved the way the producers wove hard rock tunes and today's lingo into the show's fabric and made it seem, usually anyway, as thought it fit that time span. Cool flic.

I watched this movies in my high school social's class. We were doing a unit on knights, and i was ready to pull my out my iPod to spend a class playing clash of clans, but the intro immediately caught my attention because the production levels seemed quite good.The movie was great, although character depth could've been better. A lot of weird characters coming out at random times, got me a bit confused. The ending seemed a bit stretched out and haphazard, but i still enjoyed it.Heath ledger was fantastic once again, and i really appreciated how this wasn't all about love. Very underrated, thoroughly enjoyed!

I first saw "A Knight's Tale" by chance.  A few of us had decided on an ad hoc visit to the local cinema and selected "A Knight's Tale" simply because it sounded the least "teen" movie on the bill.  We slapped down our cash and took our seats.The movie began...A crowd of peasants are assembled to watch the jousting.  And they're singing "We Will Rock You."My initial response was "God, this is going to be bad."But as the movie continued, it suddenly dawned on me - I wasn't hating the movie at all!  On an intellectual level, I should have been booing and throwing stuff at the screen but there's something about the sheer verve and energy of "A Knight's Tale" that just drags you in on an emotional level.
A clever script with many modern references, a good cast of likeable characters and a fantastic soundtrack (the reveal of "Golden Years" is particularly good) all add up to make "A Knight's Tale" one of the most entertaining mainstream movies I've seen in a long time.Normally I hate "popcorn" movies - not because I consider them "low brow" or an insult to the intelligence, but because they're shallow, tired and lack soul.  Yet "A Knight's Tale" is different.  No, it won't change your life and it won't make you ponder your place in the universe.  But it will entertain you.If you're looking for an "old fashioned" good vs. evil movie with a twist, or your copy of "The Princess Bride" is wearing thin, check out "A Knight's Tale."8/10

Brian Helgeland's A Knight's Tale is a hugely entertaining medieval romp set to modern rock classics such as Queen's 'We Will Rock You' and Thin Lizzy's 'The Boys are Back in Town'. The movie urges you to join in the fun with recognisable songs that is a jarring juxtaposition to the 14th century goings on at first but you soon get used to the idea.Heath Ledger is excellent as the peasant who wants to be a knight and, upon meeting a homeless writer, who turns out to be Chaucer, offers to forge papers so that Ledger can bluff his way into the annual jousting competition to prove his worth as a knight and finds romance along the way.This film has everything - action, adventure, comedy, romance and rock songs. It's feel good entertainment and Helgeland's unique approach still feels fresh, sassy and on point. Ledger is surrounded by a good supporting cast of Paul Bettany, Rufus Sewell, Mark Addy, Shannyn Sossamon and James Purefoy.It's the perfect mix of a smart witty script, solid acting and an off kilter approach that really works. Baz Luhrmann pulled a similar trick with both Romeo & Juliet (1996) and Moulin Rouge (2001) by mixing up period pieces with modern songs to serve the narrative in an unconventional way.

But it is mine.All HUGE heart, loyal friendship and REAL character WITH real characters. And a whole lot of fun and good laughs.Just, love it for what it is.

Why do so many people think this film isn't very good? Because they think it is historically incorrect? Do they not realise this is a comedy? I'm pretty sure that when Brian Helgeland wrote this film he knew that the song 'We Will Rock You' hadn't been released 400 years ago. I'm also sure he knew Nike hadn'd been founded yet. I think people are missing the point, because they thought it was going to be a film like Braveheart. A Knight's Tale is a story which is set in medieval times, and as a JOKE, they have mixed in things that weren't around at that time, such as the Nike sign, and Ulrich being introduced by Chaucer before his matches.The story is predictable, but in my view that doesn't really matter in a comedy if it makes you laugh on the way. Overall, I though this was a very good film, and I would recommend it to anyone willing to not take it seriously.8/10

Heath Ledger is Will, a peasant who dreams of being a glorious and great Knight. After the death of his master Will takes on the identity of Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein and enters a tournament were he finds love, friendship and a sense of identity.I'm a little late...well years late at reviewing this but its one of those films you like but never get around to reviewing...I watched this and found it to be quite funny and thrilling. Heath Ledger provides a great performance about a young man striving to grab his dreams and make them a reality, but prevented by rich snobbery. Paul Bettany is marvellous providing the adrenaline pumper that excites the crowd and drives their cheers across the country. His words sway the audience into bettering their English.... and I love his remarks towards the angry Wat.Brilliant feel good movie that drives you to obtain your dreams in one fell swoop.

OK, no-one in his right mind will believe this is a historically correct movie. The world tournament games in London, pop-hair make-up, dancing on bowie's golden years, hahaha. There is not much that should be taken too seriously and because it is so clear this movie does not pretend to be historically correct it simply works well. It is written by someone who probably had a lot of fun doing so. All the actors clearly also have fun with the role they are playing and all together is movie is just fun to watch. It is regularly shown on TV and each time again I start with thinking, no lets not watch it but somehow always end up watching it and each time with fun.It is a movie that will never stand-out or get a real cult following, but it is good for an evening feel-good entertainment. Watch and enjoy

Having read the almost universally positive reviews of this film, I, at the very least, expected passable popcorn entertainment. That is not what I received. I left unsatisfied at what I had just paid £ 5.25 to see.I don't think my expectations were especially high - just 2 hours of mindless fun.Instead I found A Knight's Tale boring, repetitive and downright silly. The jousting scenes - surely an integral part of the film - seemed like more of the same each time, and the supposed 'love' interest was about as interesting as a cardboard cutout.There are a few laughs to be had, and some of the in - jokes and references are amusing, but overall, this is unremarkable, and not a patch on the best blockbusters.4/10

if you looking for historical accuracy, for solid Medieval drama, for dramatic scenes and for old fashion historical movies, this is the worst choice. if you like an eccentric cocktail of modern music and Medieval pretext, easy story and Heath Lodger in a good role, this is a must see. because it is real seductive against it. predictable but nice. hilarious , unrealistic and chaotic. a sort of teenager game. but great in a way who has not exactly definition. because it is the sort of film for fun who could be reasonable kick to discover the truth about a period who, in this film, remains only a generous sketch.

Wow, A Knight's Tale has over 650 user reviews!!! Such is the testimony of this fine movie that is directed by Brian Helgeland, who also wrote the screenplay for Nightmare on Elm Street 4. One standout performance in my humble opinion is Nick Brimble as Sir Ector. I first saw Mr Brimble as the Prime Minister's security head in House of Cards (the original British one) and he has to be one of the most underrated British actors of our generation. His scene in A Knight's Tale where he takes on a young William Thatcher is a masterclass in acting. It needs to be shown to all aspiring actors, now!

While there are some cheesy parts in the script and Shannyn Sossamon while beautiful with a magical smile not quite convincing as the fickle love interest, there is a lot to enjoy. There is constant wit and energy, and the soundtrack is marvellous. The opening scene with We Will Rock You brought the house down when I watched it with my family, and that scene was one of the more exhilarating moments in the film. The dialogue is modern, but there are some flashes of authenticity. One of two of them come across as cheesy but others work surprisingly well. There is a lot going on in the story, sometimes this can be a problem, with the length the film is at nearly two and a quarter hours, my feelings were mixed here. The side story about William's blind father was touching, but for my liking there were too many jousting matches. I will say the acting is very good, with Heath Ledger dashing, Rufus Sewell seedy as the Count and Paul Bettany stealing the show in a wonderfully comic turn as Geoffrey Chaucer. Overall, entertaining and fun, doesn't always work but I liked it. 7/10 Bethany Cox

A Knight's Tale is an entertaining action adventure. It may not be the best movie ever made but it's still pretty good. Director Brian Helgeland does an admirable job of making this movie about a peasant squire who creates a new identity for himself as a knight after the death of his master. The late Heath Ledger is excellent as William Thatcher the peasant who becomes a knight. Ledger showed in all the films he's been in his talent and this one is no different. R.I.P. Ledger. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Mark Addy, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany, Alan Tudyk, and Shannyn Sossaman. The movie has plenty of action and fights that are well executed with some small does of humor. Also worth mentioning Ledger, Addy, Bettany, and Tudyk had great chemistry together making their friendships believable. They brought much of the comic relief to the movie as well. Ledger also had a good chemistry with Sossman who was impressive as his love interest. Rufus Sewell was a solid villain but he wasn't given much to do except for a few action sequences. The pacing was a little slow at times making it feel a little long. The final confrontation between Ledger and Sewell was fitting it was a bit of a letdown. With it's flaws aside though A Knight's Tale is still a solid adventure with just enough action, humor, a little romance, and exceptional performances by the cast especially Ledger who make this movie worth the time to watch.

The first time I saw A Knight's Tale (on cable, missed it in theater), I had the same reaction as many of you - Queen? David Bowie? In a movie set in the middle ages?But I stayed with it, and I'm glad I did. Once you get past the glaring anachronisms (put in the film on purpose, of course), you find the movie is actually quite true to its period.The presence of Chaucer in the film, combined with some of its details, leads me to suspect that Brian Helgeland has read "Chaucer's Knight" by fellow filmmaker Terry Jones (of Monty Python fame). The book deconstructs the knight in Chaucer's "The Knight's Tale" in a totally unique way -- he is seen NOT as the flower of medieval chivalry (as most scholars have interpreted him), but as a mercenary out for nothing but money and blood. The character in the film Chaucer would have written about, then, is not Sir William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), but Count Adhemar of Anjou (Rufus Sewell).The part of the film in which this connection "clicked" for me was the scene where Count Adhemar is called away to his command in a "Free Company" -- a particular stain on the reputation of knighthood which Jones talks extensively about in his book.Jones' book made use of extensive research into medieval history, and Helgeland's film obviously does, too.Chaucer was a master of satire in his day. Helgeland's use of modern conventions in a period film is a conceit of which - I believe - Chaucer would definitely have approved.I gave "A Knight's Tale" 9 out of 10 - it's not perfect, but I like it so much, I try to watch it every time it comes on (it's been on HBO and Cinemax pretty regularly for the past several months). Check it out!

I'm into history and this is one of my favorite eras. Although this movie is hardly historically accurate, nor does it try to be, it does achieve the stereotype of British royalty wannabees, which I find delightful.I don't care for the rock music in the movie at all, I love rock music but it does have it's place. The music does make an effort to reach viewers who might otherwise not be interested in movies with an historic aspect.Heath Ledger and Alan Tudyk are both quite handsome, good choices for the leads. Together with diverse actor Mark Addy they make a most believable team, all three filled with interesting personalities and character.I understand that this was not supposed to be an historic fashion statement, but Jocelyn's clothes fell short of looking even remotely period, more like out of place. I preferred the worn out rags on the men to the fancy 1960s looking elegant fashionwear.Rufus Sewell played the antagonist quite well, regal and handsome, delightfully evil, yet had to be shown his place.I find this movie fun to watch, and in spite of it's drawbacks I keep coming back for more!

This comment is to counter those who have issue with modern rock and other time problems being in this movie. This movie was designed to entertain. It was NOT a historical piece and nowhere does it claim to be one. This is the story of a boy who aspires to be more than what society set out for him. The movie uses odd references to history's great figures and humor to bring its story across to the viewer. So I say that, for those of you who cannot enjoy a piece of entertainment due to its well placed use of anachronisms, I strongly suggest you stay away from any of Shakespeare's works. (Not to say that this movie was on level with Shakespeare...) The makers of "A Knight's Tale" set out to entertain, and did so dutifully.

I didn't know what to expect, but I really loved this cast and the soundtrack. This is what you call pure fun. Tudyk and Bettany are such a great addition and Heath Ledger has one of those faces you just can't resist. I am glad I finally got to watch this!

As soon as I saw the fans singing and clapping to "We Will Rock You" I thought "this is not very realistic".  Of course, that was when I had gone in expecting a film like Braveheart or The Patriot, with real historical lessons.  A Knight's Tale was nothing like either of those. After you get past the first one or two scenes, everything really grows on you.  The humor is, yes, cheesy at times, (the Nike armor) but I still laughed.  Chaucer was great, the villain was definitely evil, and the jousting/action scenes were very well done.  Put all that together with some other funny sidekicks and a little romance and you've got a pretty good flick.  Definitely a must see more than once, and a must buy video/DVD when it's out!

Brian Helgeland's "A Knight's Tale" is a medieval adventure story with a twist. Heath Ledger plays a peasant who assumes the identity of a nobleman in order to compete as a jouster. The twist is that anachronistic elements are purposely introduced into the movie in order to give it a flavour not unlike a contemporary sports movie.This approach is perhaps most apparent in the classic rock soundtrack that features well chosen tracks from the likes of Queen, Thin Lizzy & Sly and the Family Stone. The dialogue is also a successful mixture of period and modern English. The costuming also employs an intriguing mixture of old and new styles.The liberties taken with history may rub some viewers the wrong way but I think that they set the movie apart from the many others that are set in the same time-frame. Helgeland's script also incorporates Geoffrey Chaucer as a character, which is a nice touch. I feel that the movie may not capitalize on its unique approach to the fullest extent but the story is generally enjoyable, so it isn't a major problem.Though the movie was mainly a starring vehicle for Heath Ledger the supporting cast was obviously assembled with care. Ledger's band of merry men includes Alan Tudyk, Mark Addy and Paul Bettany, fine actors all. Rufus Sewell is effective as the villain of the piece while James Purefoy makes a welcome appearance as well. Female lead Shannyn Sossamon is a bit of weak link as far as I'm concerned but her maid is pre-"The Artist" Berenice Bejo.Visually, the movie is attractive, if not especially so. Helgeland's strength lies in writing (as evidenced by his Oscar for "L.A. Confidential") but his directorial skills are not to be dismissed. Musically, the movie's soundtrack is nicely chosen while the supporting score is functional without making much of an impression.Overall, "A Knight's Tale" proves to be an enjoyable period movie enlivened by some modern touches. The presentation may be more adventurous than the story itself but the movie ably fulfils its function as light entertainment.

Everything about `A Knight's Tale' is shamelessly designed to pander the masses.  Writer/director Brian Helgeland, who scored big with `L.A. Confidential' has followed that excellent effort with a succession of progressively worse screenplays (`Conspiracy Theory', `The Postman', `Payback') culminating in this charming but trite puff piece.The pity is that the story had possibilities.  A squire seizes upon the opportune death of his knight to enter a jousting competition and ultimately, albeit illegitimately, establish himself as a top competitor. William/Ulrich (Heath Ledger) begins the film with no skills whatever and with the help of his hapless lads, miraculously is transformed into a lean mean jousting machine.  He is then thunderstruck by the utterly bland Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) and spends the rest of the film trying to win her love.  Meanwhile Kate (Laura Fraser), the only interesting female character, with excellent potential for an intriguing romantic entanglement, is relegated to becoming William's groupie.  Despite good potential for a serious medieval drama, Helgeland decides that it should follow a rutted and unimaginative formula so that it will appeal to all those millions who have loved this same story in different forms countless times before.  As if that isn't enough, he further debases it by filling it with anachronistic contemporary dialogue (`Oh Wow', `Helllllloooo', `Foxy Lady', etc.) and rock music to which all the medieval peasants join in to sing along and boogie.  This wouldn't be so bad if the film was constructed to be a spoof, but after each of these absurd digressions, Helgeland switches back into drama mode, asking us once again to take his characters seriously.Helgeland can't seem to decide whether he wants this to be a farce, a send up, or a serious drama.  It is all out of sync.  The film is funny when it is trying to be serious and dull when it is trying to be funny.  I don't even want to get into how historically unrealistic his depiction of medieval Europe is.  The only redeeming quality of Helgeland's direction is the stunt work on the jousting scenes.  The jousting is brilliantly done and (of course) unabashedly overused.  After a couple of dozen broken lances, it is hard to get up for the final match between William and the evil Count Adhemar as all the spectacle has been wrung out.  It would be like having 25 chariot races in Ben-Hur and asking us to be excited about the 26th race against Messala.Heath Ledger is airy and adorable as William, qualities I know I always associate with medieval knights (sarcasm intended).  Ledger plays the part with such lack of force that it is difficult to believe the rushing wind didn't knock him off his horse long before the opponent's lance hit the mark.  Shannyn Sossamon is pretty, but equally mind-numbing.  Their romance has all the heft of balsa wood and all the maturity of a date to the Junior Prom.Paul Bettany steals what is left of the show with his spirited portrayal of Chaucer.  Bettany provides us with a most remarkable interpretation of the celebrated author, whipping the crowds into frenzy with his commanding introductions.  Rufus Sewell is a passable villain, but comes across more obnoxious than despicable.Overall, this film is so utterly insubstantial and obsequious to the masses that it had to be a hit.  This is another typical Hollywood cotton candy film, sweet with no substance.  It is charming, light, and predicable, giving everyone exactly what they want and expect.  I rated it a 4/10 including a point for the great stunt work.  Serious filmgoers are cautioned to lower their expectations.
