A good old-fashioned scary movie, avoiding irony and self-referentialism at every turn, this film relies on a nice premise and some well-executed creepy atmosphere for its impact. Pfeiffer and Ford work well together as a middle-aged couple, with Pfeiffer particularly effective as the homey (though obviously ridiculously beautiful) mother left alone when her daughter heads off to college, working herself up into a panic at various, vaguely spooky goings-on around the place. The film plays its cards close to its chest throughout, working the old game of keeping the audience guessing for a good while ? is there really something supernatural going on, is it some kind of creepy but human plot, or is it all in her head? Of course it's all revealed in the end, in a solidly scary, thrilling and well-executed finale. A classic it ain't, but it has a kind of workmanlike, reliable quality oozing out of every scene.

Robert Zemeckis' homage to Hitchcock (funny how we always say 'homage' and not 'plagiarism') concerns a married couple, their spooky new house, a suspicious neighbor...and enough red herrings to weigh down any commercially-viable product. Still, I was hooked for about a third of the way (once the wife supernaturally took on the persona of a missing woman and seduced her husband with a little licking and biting, I began losing faith). By the finale, so many gimmicks are being thrown at the screen, it just becomes an upscale B-flick. All the inconsistencies aside, one has to applaud Michelle Pfeiffer for her gratifying performance; even though the entire subplot about Pfeiffer's neighbor leads nowhere, she is very appealing walking up to the man in public and calling him a "murdering son-of-a-b*tch". Harrison Ford is fairly solid as well, until the last act which leaves both he and Michelle completely rudderless. That's when the filmmakers go overboard and sink this suspense-thriller in a sea of slick desperation. **1/2 from ****

This movie was a well-crafted thriller in the Hitchcock style; I really wish I had not seen any of the trailers prior to viewing this movie, because some of the suspense that would normally have built up during the first hour was spoiled by knowledge gained from the trailer.  To be fair, the trailer doesn't spoil everything (thank goodness), but it spoils enough to make the first hour seem a little slow in the build-up.Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific in her role of the housewife and mother now facing an empty nest, as her daughter heads off to college.  Robert Zemeckis does a fine job of building suspense and keeping the audience just a little off-balance (in spite of the spoilers in the trailers); in combination with Pfeiffer's acting, one is never quite sure whether Claire Spencer is deranged, possessed, or calculating.  While Harrison Ford does his usual fine job of acting, as the obsessive, genius husband living in the shadow of his super-genius father, it is Pfeiffer who, of the two, has the most screen time and who therefore carries the film.My only other complaint (besides the spoilers in the trailers) has to do with a minor bit of casting. While I think Wendy Crewson is a fine actress, I have to question casting her as the wife of one of Dr. Spencer's colleagues, given that she so recently appeared as Harrison Ford's wife in Air Force One... seeing Ford and Crewson together on screen again was a distraction that brought me out of the film, at a point when I should have been getting more absorbed into the film.  But it is a minor point.Overall, the movie kept me in suspense virtually throughout it's entirety, and the final 30 minutes were gripping.  At several points toward the end, I thought for sure I knew what was going to happen, only to be surprised by a sudden twist or unexpected turn.  And, the film does have its humorous moments as well; Diane Scarwid helps to lighten things up as Claire's somewhat ditzy friend Jody, and Zemeckis has some fun with some of the backdrops in the quaint New England towns (a Vermont town named Adamant? And the name of the curio shop is "The Sleeping Dog", as in "Let sleeping dogs lie.")Rating: 8 out of 10

**SPOILERS**   **SPOILERS** Is it possible, in the wake of 'Scream' and its inertia-veering ilk, to offer today's audience a 'straight'  horror movie, especially if that horror movie is a ghost story, that most vulnerable of its sub-genres to falling on its face.  You're inclined to think Robert Zemeckis believes so, because, despite a few humorous moments firmly rooted in character, he offers an admirably solemn chiller aimed at tensing you to maddening point, preying on those fears you'd rather repress, those things that lie beneath.For about 100 minutes.  The first thing to be wary about in this movie - and this is the sort of movie where you need to be manically vigilant or you needn't bother - is the title.  It's too easy, almost mocking.  After all, the whole point of a horror movie is to reveal what lies beneath.  You may as well call a crime film 'Cops and Robbers' or a period effort 'Frills and Flounces'.By a canny Zemickian paradox, however, the opposite may be actually true. For this is a movie that wears its Hitchcockian subtext defiantly on its surface.  It plays with at least three different 'classic' horror-thriller staples.  At first you might think you're watching 'Rear Window', as Claire believes the mysteriously uncivil man next door has done away with his wife. As in Hitchcock's film, there is the ambiguous night scene, where the husband appears to be bundling off a corpse.  There is the voyeurism, culminating in a brilliant, hilarious, shocking shot, where Claire's prying eye is met by the eye she was spying on through the fence.  You figure Hitchcock would approve.  She spies on the husband with binoculars and he catches her doing it.  Her lover, in this case her husband, doesn't believe her.  L.B. Jeffries was a cameraman, photographs play a big part in this movie.  While her husband is out making all the money, she is alone and vulnerable.  Like the two couples in 'Rear Window', Claire finds uncomfortable affinities with the victim.But just when you're patting yourself on the back and asking how gender transforms the classic Hitchcockian set-up, the whole thing is revealed as a damp squib, and you have to begin again (although you do get an excellent joke when she meets the suspect and his victim at a party).
The other two options are similarly 'traditional'.  There is the psychological deterioration model.  Zemeckis pushes this for all it is worth, making Claire a mother who has just lost her only child to college, who's recovering from an horrific car crash only a year ago, whose husband neglects her for his work, and most importanly, who has given up her music career to raise her daughter and support a family.  There's enough in there to frazzle the hardiest kook.  Add an isolated house with a dodgy front door, and is it any wonder she's having visions?This model brings horror close to its roots in melodrama, where the horrors become a displacement of the frustration and repressions of a woman limited in her life choices - the home serves as a metaphor for both her entrapment and her deteriorating mind.  The first image, over the credits, is seen as an hallucination of Claire's, and we are properly on our guard throughout. This breakdown is catered for by the whole gamut of classic Freudian paraphernalia - repeated scenes (the bath), submergence in water, keys, rings, bracelets, hair, doors, glass, mirrors, Oedipal problems etc, all leading us to suspect a sexually based trauma.  This is linked to the third model, the family secret, where a past horror is locked away, and is slowly eating away at the family and its individuals.  Relief will not come until it is expelled.As I say, for about 100 minutes Zemickis plays on all three models with surface seriousness and covert playfulness (which is what really lies beneath).  This is fine by me, the repertoire of haunted house cliches is generally amusing, especially when done with such intelligence, visual (all that white with its sparse splashes of red; the ghostly message on the mirror, 'You Know', cracking over Claire's fogged reflecton), formal (loved those scenes with the psychiatrist) beauty, and rich characterisation of the female lead.  This method achieves some excellent jerks, and an atmosphere almost as chilling in its potential as 'Final Destination'.But a state of tense suspension cannot be held indefinitely (in Hollywood anyway), and plot must out.  This shift can be accurately traced at the moment when Claire's point of view, which has, without interruption, dominated and filtered the film for 100 minutes.  For the film to achieve resoluton, it has to move from female time, which is repetitive, fluid, elliptical, enigmatic, open into male time, which is straight-ahead, no-nonsense, progresive, explanatory, closed.  This is a gross stereotype, but it's true here, and as Norman takes over, the film collapses into daft 'Fatal Attraction' territory.  Or it appears to, until you wonder whether Zemeckis's joke is finally paying off, as he asks how we could possibly have taken this seriously, with the 'Psycho' quotes in the film and on the soundtrack virtually giving it away.  The way Claire gets out of the death-bath and her final supernatural rescue are so ridiculous they have to be a joke.  And so a subtle portrait of marriage and female loneliness becomes another post-modern joke.  Oh well.

I'm getting really tired of movies that portray a Ghost as a modern-day "The Riddler" from the Batman TV series! Like The Riddler, the Ghost in "What Lies Beneath" has all the answers that you're looking for -- but you're only going to get pieces to the puzzle one incoherent piece at a time.Let's all get on the same page here for a minute. We know, having watched the movie in full, that the ghost has these powers/abilities: 1) Can TYPE ON A COMPUTER KEYBOARD (or, at the very least, get words to appear on a computer screen)!! 2) Can write easy-to-read English on a fogged-up mirror, as if you were using your finger. 3) Can appear to numerous people (as the ghost appeared, in one way or another, to both the main stars in the movie). 4) Can open closed doors. 5) I'm not entirely sure about this one, but it seemed as if the ghost "took over" Claire's body and/or mind at one point (and mysteriously began acting sexually towards her murderer of all people, Mr. Ford).Why would a ghost, with the abilities outlined above, give you vague clues in pieces and not simply tell you what the hell is going on?! As a Ghost, if you can get words to appear on a computer screen, WHY IN THE HELL wouldn't you just write "Your husband is a murderer, you can find my body at the end of your dock, my name is...". Why would you simply type your initials hundreds of times over and over?! Again, are we dealing with The Riddler here?! If that wouldn't work, how about just writing to Claire on the mirror after every shower each day?? If you were a Ghost, and all you COULD DO is leave messy clues to somebody you hope will help solve your murder, would you, upon getting screamed at from the top of your helper's lungs "What do you want?!?!" -- really write back a simple "You Know!"???? Obviously she didn't know yet, she was still gathering clues and thought she was going insane!! Wouldn't you have used that moment to write something just a bit more profound?! Like, maybe, "I need your help!". Wow.And at one point the Ghost "took over" Claire's body and/or mind -- don't even get me started on how she could have easily killed her murderer -- so shouldn't she have tried killing Harrison Ford's character, her murderer, instead of just getting him horny?! I could go on and on, but at this point, I'm fatigued over this plot-hole-filled tripe. I just want to emphasize -- I hate when Ghosts are portrayed as The Riddler's character in the Batman series - as simple clue-givers.:) JD

A professor's wife believes that her neighbor is a murderer; but her personal terror is trying to cope with a spirit haunting her new home. Harrison Ford is what we think is a mild mannered genius. His neurotic wife is played by the ever classy Michelle Pfeiffer. We see a very different side of Ford and Miss Pfeiffer at one point has only her eyes to relay her torment. What I really liked best about the movie is the sound effects. It reminds me of days gone by when the sounds of the wind, a rainy night, footsteps and a squeaking door speak volumes. This movie is not necessarily too long, it just moves slowly getting to the energy packed finale. Your palms will sweat and you will inch to the edge of your seat. The terror filled twisting climax is well worth the ride.

Robert Zemeckis's "What Lies Beneath," released in 2000, is a compelling blend of supernatural horror and suspenseful thriller. Anchored by stellar performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford, the film delivers an atmospheric, spine-chilling experience despite a few plot contrivances."What Lies Beneath" centers on Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer), who starts experiencing strange occurrences in her Vermont home after her daughter leaves for college. Her husband, Norman (Harrison Ford), dismisses her fears as empty nest syndrome. But as the ghostly encounters escalate, Claire is pulled into a terrifying mystery that reveals shocking secrets about her life and marriage.Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is the beating heart of the movie. As Claire, she expertly conveys a wide spectrum of emotions - from initial unease to sheer terror, and finally, desperate resolve. Pfeiffer's nuanced portrayal of a woman grappling with inexplicable supernatural events while also questioning her sanity keeps the viewers rooted in the narrative. Harrison Ford, diverging from his typical heroic roles, delivers a surprisingly subdued yet effective performance as the aloof and somewhat dismissive husband.The film's strengths lie in its masterful build-up of suspense. Zemeckis, known for his work on films like "Back to the Future" and "Forrest Gump," shows a flair for creating an atmosphere of mounting dread. The use of slow, tension-filled sequences, chilling music score, and artful cinematography makes the most of the spooky New England setting, resulting in numerous effective jump scares.However, "What Lies Beneath" does have its weaknesses. The plot relies heavily on some genre tropes and contrivances, with a few twists that may feel predictable for avid thriller or horror viewers. The pacing is uneven at times, with the film taking a while to get going, and some plot points feel somewhat rushed or underdeveloped.The supernatural elements and the focus on character-driven tension give "What Lies Beneath" a Hitchcockian feel. However, the narrative doesn't always maintain this subtlety, occasionally veering into more conventional horror territory, especially towards the end.In conclusion, "What Lies Beneath" is an engaging supernatural thriller that benefits from strong performances and a creepy, suspense-filled atmosphere. Despite some plot and pacing issues, it offers a gripping and occasionally terrifying viewing experience that will appeal to fans of the genre.

"What Lies Beneath" has an excellent premise, and starts off as a rather spooky ghost story that will guarantee the viewer bone chilling scares within the first hour. But the story, the scares, everything seems to fall apart midway through.A-list celebrity Michelle Pfeiffer (one of my favorite actresses, I might add) plays Claire Spencer, a house wife married to Norman Spencer (the legendary Harrison Ford). Their daughter has just gone away to college, and with Norman gone at work all day long, Claire is pretty much left all alone at her home until night. Claire is a little depressed, but keeps herself busy gardening. One day, however, she encounters a wildly sobbing neighbor. She's hysterical, and Claire, being her nosy, middle-aged self, attempts to comfort her and asks what's wrong. She ignores her, of course, crying hysterically in her own little world. Claire, worried, tells her husband Norman later that night, but he tells her to mind her own business. Claire ignores him, and she and her friends spy on their neighbors house throughout the day. When they see the husband carrying an implied life bag with her body in in, putting it the back seat of his car, she is convinces that her husband murdered his wife.But the story doesn't end there. Her lights sometimes randomly go out. The door swings open every now and then. And then a frightening message appears on the mirror. Claire is convinced that her house is haunted by the spirit of her murdered neighbor. What will she do? How will she put the spirit to rest? The first hour of the movie is extremely scary, suspenseful, and has a genuinely creep atmosphere. But then there comes a twist about midway through. A bad twist, and the whole hour of the movie goes to waste, and doesn't seem to relate at all to the movie's original plot. The first hour just seemed like a scapegoat. I'm not going to give it away, but it was a disappointing turn in the movie.The movie runs 130 minutes long, where it could have been cut down to a mere 100 minutes. The twist is where it started going downhill. There are still a few more scares throughout and a few more "Oh get out of there! Wait! Don't do that! Get your butt out of there!!" moments, but the first hour easily swallows the second hour and eats it for supper. After the twist, the movie seems to drag on. Suddenly, we don't seem to care about the story, what happens next, and it becomes somewhat boring.The first half of the movie is thrilling, while the second half has it's moments, but the movie as a whole fails to live up to expectations thanks to the ending.However, the movie has gotten some great reviews so maybe it's ll down to taste. The acting is top notch (what else would you expect from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford?) and it's overall a good, ghost story to watch on a Saturday night. Definitely recommended.

What Lies Beneath is a 2000 supernatural horror thriller film directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer.A women start witnessing disturbing supernatural activities after moving to the old house of her husband, soon she discovers a shocking past about her husband.Calling this film a horror film will not be correct as this film is more of a psychological thriller with a hint of horror and apart from few jump scares there is nothing in the film that can define this film as horror film.We have seen such plots in the past and execution of the film also gets predictable. The film doesn't excites much and the super slow speed of the film might irritate few viewers. The film also lacks the depth and intensity.Acting is superb and probably the only highlight of the film. Climax of the film is also predictable and doesn't excites much.Overall the film could've been a decent film but the super slow speed and predictable execution spoils the show and the film turns out to be another average film.

This is an example of a cheesy, low-budget idea gone Big-Budget, High-Concept Hollywood. The sole screenplay to date by actor Clark Gregg is an uneasy mix of supernatural thriller, suspense film and psycho-killer-horror with a clumsy exposition. The secondary characters are throw-aways, as the story suffocatingly focuses on a professor and his wife. Harrison Ford plays his role with all the passion of a cigar-store Indian, while Michelle ("Don't hate me because I'm beautiful") Pfeiffer does her boilerplate pained-and-tormented turn, complete with pinched cheeks and crocodile tears. Robert Zemeckis' direction is banal at best. The over-the-top CGI work is largely superfluous and overblown, particularly during the climactic scenes. Some reviewers described this as "Hitchcock-like" but Hitchcock would never have touched such a sub-par script nor depended so heavily on f/x. In fact, "What Lies Beneath" is rather short on suspense. There are, admittedly, a couple of scares but, shamelessly over 2 hours long, this "thriller" is largely inflated and anemic, and more closely resembles bottom-of-the-barrel DePalma.

*Warning: Some Major Spoilers*What Lies Beneath had a brief trailer and I hadn't heard much about it, so, when I went to see it, I was a bit unsure about what I was about to see. Fortunately, I largely enjoyed myself in this mysterious horror film.The film opens with Norman and Claire Spencer (played to perfection by Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfieffer) sending Claire's daughter away to college. Claire fears being alone in the house, but soon grows to the idea because she feels she will have her life back again. One day, while sitting on her terrace, she hears a woman crying next door, and upon investigation of the events of her new neighbors, she begins to wonder if the husband has killed his wife. Meanwhile, in her own house, strange occurrences, such as breaking pictures, opening doors and whispering voices lead her to believe that a ghost, possibly her "dead" neighbor, is trying to contact her. Claire soon discovers that all she thinks has happened is not at all true, with her neighbour very much alive and happy again. But the apparitions still permeate throughout the house, filling bathtubs and turning off lights. As Claire begins to dig into "who" is trying to contact her, she discovers that her husband had an affair with a young woman. Claire confronts Norman about the woman, and he tells her that the girl committed suicide when he tried breaking off the relationship. But that is not the end of Claire's journey, for she will soon discover that even the perfect husband has flaws.The acting is near perfection, Michelle Pfeiffer deserves an Academy Award for her brilliant and masterful performance, but Harrison Ford surprisingly takes a back seat for most of the film, until the last 30 minutes, where his character really breaks out into something evil, Claire discovers why Norman has been trying to keep his secret for so long. The direction is very satisfying, Zemeckis builds up so much tension, What Lies Beneath is one of the only films I have ever screamed in. Two really scary parts are the binocular scene and the horrifying bath-tub sequence.A film not to be missed, What Lies Beneath is possibly one of the scariest movies of our time. And a cracker mystery...I rate What Lies Beneath 8 out of 10.
