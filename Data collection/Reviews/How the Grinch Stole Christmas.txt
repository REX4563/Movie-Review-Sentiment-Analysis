Great and Delightful Film. Funny Enough and Great Message. This was a True Christmas Spirit I would say. The Characters are So Great. This Movie touches my Heart From The Ending. They should make movies like this someday

This movie really reveals the meaning of Christmas by revealing what It is not about, which is materialism or gifts. By grabbing hold of and finding the strength of the very merry, holly and jolly Christmas, he saves everyone's Christmas instead of stealing or ruining it. They make his Christmas the best one so far, and he makes the Christmas their best ever. By watching this with my grandfather, it really brought out the Christmas spirit in me. It really, truly did. It made my Christmas. The music in this movie brought it up, if just a little. It was nice, it was indeed. I am giving it 6 or 7 stars out of a possible 10. I think I will give it 7, because it made my Christmas a bit better. Bon soir. Goodnight. Guten nacht. God natt. Buenos Noches. Peace & Love God Bless Shevy

This movie was never intended to win an Oscar, but for what it is, this movie is an absolute Christmas classic. I was a kid when I saw this in theaters and it still makes me crack up at 28. Jim Carrey is hilarious as the Grinch!

If you enjoyed the cartoon version, you'll enjoy this more. The setting and makeup really makes this look like a Dr. Seuss film, freaking Jim Carrey as The Grinch is the best thing out of this movie...that's all I have to say.

Ron Howard's version of The Grinch turned a wonderful children's book about love overcoming greed into an outsider revenge story complete with an alternate bad guy.  Apparently the original plot violates the Hollywood code by allowing the bad guy to get away without being punished.  Why not make a new version of "A Christmas Carol" and create a new character to take the fall at the end?  Scrooge's silent, more evil partner perhaps.

Of course it isn't as good as the animated classic, an immensely charming, beautifully animated gem, that is a family Christmas favourite. I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8/10 Bethany Cox

Jim's score...the rest as it is too boring and forced

Jim Carrey is very funny, but this movie was a complete failure to me. It was just a bizarre, poorly-written kiddie movie, which are among the worst kinds of movies. I'm surprise it did as well as it did. I thought it was pretty bad. There were almost no funny jokes, the Grinch was way too bizarre (the kid version of him was too sadistic also), and when those elements weren't being presented, it was filled with corniness often found in bad kiddie movies. The way the Grinch was written was what ruined the whole movie for me. He was just too bizarre and too sadistic. I'm sure Jim Carrey did what he could with it, but "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is one story that shouldn't have been made into a full-length, non-animated movie. I thought it should've stayed an animated, 1950s TV movie. This was an attempt at "improving" a beloved tale that failed miserably. No one should have to watch this bad flick.

In the land of Whoville everyone loves Christmas and count down the whole year until that wonderful time.  However just outside Whoville lives the Grinch, a green hairy twisted creature that hates, and always has hated, Christmas and was rejected by the Who's as a child.  A young girl from Whoville sets out to befriend the Grinch and help him find his love of Christmas but, when it goes wrong early on, the Grinch becomes even more rotten and plans to ruin it for everyone.I have never read the book or seen the original animated version of this story, but I do enjoy a bit of Dr Seuss and was worried about how such imagination would be filled out on the screen.  The film actually manages it very well and the whole film has the look of the books, even if it lacks soul at times.  The plot is stretched out to the running time and could have easily been shorter and punchier, but at heart it is a good little moral that is good from Christmas time.However, aside from the look of the film, the main reason that the film works is Jim Carrey.  I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off this role as well as he did.  He is manic and really funny although I imagine that if you dislike him and his antics that you'd hate the film totally.  I'm on the fence about him but I did enjoy him here.  Momsen is OK but really just a `cute kid' and, while the support cast has quite a few famous faces, they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it - which he happily does.Overall this film is a little too long and padded out, but while Carrey is onscreen it seems to go pretty fast due to his hyper acting and comedy antics.  However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time.

I first saw this back in 2000 or 2001 i think. I gotta tell you it is funny. Jim Carreys facial expressions, attitude, voice, every thing matchs the "Grinch". The Whos are great and resemble the characters in the original story. Instead of a silent film with nothing but a narrator this one has acting and i did like the touch. It shows kind of the history of the Grinch and the other whos involved in his hate for Christmas. It does a good job at that. But is it as good as the original?? I don't think so, but what is out there today!If you want a holiday movie to get you in happiness tears and reminders of your childhood watch the original Grinch. If you want a great holiday laugh, watch Ron howards How the Grinch Stole Christmas. 6/10*

Ok first of all I don't know why people hate this movie so much. Is this better than the TV version? Absolutely not. I'm pretty sure there wasn't an explosion in the book, just going to throw that out there. It's certainly not a perfect Christmas movie but it does have heart. I saw this movie as a child and I thought it wasn't bad, and now watching an adult the dialogue is full of words that are seventh grade level that I started to break out the dictionary. Ron Howard does an amazing job of flipping the script where we feel for the Grinch's pain and makes the WHOVILLES the villains. Anyway it may not be perfect but it does have heart so back off.

The Grinch steals a car from a tiny Who when he is causing chaos in the town at his "award ceremony". It is very confusing because tiny Whos are basically nowhere else to be found in the rest of the film. We see their cars but what do their houses look like? Do they live in special neighborhoods or something?I thought that the social and political dynamic between Whos and the tiny Whos was not explored to its fullest potential. It would have been interesting to see the level of discrimination they experience in life and work. I would figure that they would have a special council in the Whoville legislature or something like that. Really a missed opportunity by the writers.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas is based on both the book and the short cartoon under the same name, by the author named Dr Seuss. Now If anyone who either read the book or watch the cartoon you'll know that both of them are completely under 1 hour, you can easily go through the story from beginning to the end around under 30 minutes, But how can an hour and 44 minute film do both the book and cartoon justice? (Spoiler: It doesn't)The jokes are both unfunny and awkward, the town known as Whoville looks cloudy and feels like the colors are muted almost if the camera lens has been wiped down by vaseline, the Whos looks weird and are competitive about Christmas and while the rest of the characters are uninteresting; Jim Carrey I can give him some credit for adding energy while wearing green latex, but for performance he's annoying.Overall I felt the movie was disimproving not only the book, but to the cartoon also, it felt unnecessary to add extra time to a simple short story that didn't have to be shown on a silver screen and that's why I consider the cartoon to be better.

The Grinch hates Christmas, then steals it!When this first came out I liked the original version much more, but as time goes on I'm finding myself preferring this version more and more. Perhaps it's because Jim Carey's portrayal is more relatable, or perhaps I'm more impressed with the visuals and production value than I once was, or maybe I just understand the adult jokes more. Whatever the reason, this is a fantastic adaptation.What stands out above all is Jim Carey's performance, followed by the sets and costumes. It is an unforgettable experience that might never be replicated again.While kids may prefer the original, certainly this will be all the adults most preferred version of the Grinch.

Ron Howard generally doesn't disappoint me, but I think he cut too much out of this movie in the editing room then he should have.  There were people leaving the theatre asking themselves why didn't they have more scenes with the Grinch and his gadgets?  That is exactly my question, if he had allowed for another 15-20 minutes of the Grinch stealing presents this movie would have been that much better.  I guess I'll have to wait for the directors cut as always.  A decent kids movie for the holidays though.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the city of Whoville which is filled with Whos. One day a grinch is accidentally delivered there and tries to understand their ways and love for Christmas but fails and comes to loath it. He moves into the far mountains of Whoville and becomes a hermit. When a little girl knocks on his door and tries to get him in the Christmas spirit he decides to take his hate for Christmas out on the locals. Can anyone or anything stop him?This movie is directed by icon Ron Howard (Splash) and stars Jim Carrey (Liar Liar), Clint Howard (The Waterboy), Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development), Christine Baranski (Chicago), Molly Shannon (Superstar) and Taylor Momsen (Gossip Girls).Everything about this movie is perfect. The universe is perfectly created and thoroughly captures your imagination. The backdrops, sets and props are stupendous. The costumes, makeup and hairstyles were a lot of fun. Jim Carrey delivers an amazing performance. His dialogue, mannerisms and facial expressions are awesome. The storyline is well written and I loved the way it explains how the Grinch arrived, his childhood, his current state and his evolution. How can you not love Max and the ending was perfect. Even the soundtrack is good.Overall, this is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.

I love this version of the Grinch and Jim Carrey was perfect for the role of the grinch it's great and hilarious i also feel bad for the guy cause it must of been a pain to take that costume on and off.

The fact that this movie was boring is not why I despise it so.  It is because Visa was the official card of Whoville.  The commercialization of this film go against the original intent of Dr. Seuss's timeless story. It is an affront to all things Seuss!  Give me the cartoon any day!

I have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down.Why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be.This film is supposed to be a light hearted, tonge in cheek, family comedy, things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults, and that is exactly what this film does.I laughed my nuts off at this film, I thought Carey put in a great performance and the whole film (if watched at Christmas) really give you a bit of festive cheerSo to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and take films for what they are supposed to be, entertainment!!

Great and Delightful Film. Funny Enough and Great Message. This was a True Christmas Spirit I would say. The Characters are So Great. This Movie touches my Heart From The Ending. They should make movies like this someday

Big budget remake of the classic cartoon about a creature (Jim Carrey) intent on stealing Christmas.I had rather low expectations for this one... not sure why, as it turned out to be quite good. I just wanted to add a few thoughts here.First of all, Taylor Momsen nailed the Cindy Lou Who part. She has gone on to bigger, better things ("Gossip Girl") and good for her. Second, Ron Howard nailed the look of a Seussian world. The faces, the architecture, it all seems so right and I think the good doctor would have approved. I heard that Tim Burton was approached to direct, and I think he would have done a fine job, but how do you beat this? And last, Jim Carrey. Wow. He has had some good and bad career decisions, and this has to be among his best. The physical comedy, the improvised jokes, it was like the role he was born to play. The other choices were Jack Nicholson and Eddie Murphy. Nicholson could possibly have done it ten years earlier, but did he have that range of motion in 2000? And Eddie Murphy? Maybe, maybe not. This was a Carrey role inside and out.

Well, I finally broke down and went to see it.  I was hesitant after reading all the pans here.  Egad!   It was a great movie! You can't compare it to the "original" any more  than you can compare "Scrooge" to the eternal Dickens classic.  It has a life of its own.  Jim Carrey was amazing.   How he can deliver so many feelings and emotions behind 10 pounds of latex is fantastic.  Some of his scenes (obviously impromptu) were so funny I nearly wet myself.  The sets were great and not nearly as over-blown as I had expected.  As for the  "prequel" portion, well, it was only so-so. The best part of the whole show is when they sing the "Ah hoo torres" song at the end which has ALWAYS been my most favorite Christmas song ever.I recommend the movie highly to kids and adults.   As for the negative comments on imdb.com I gotta say..."get over it, ya big bunch of grinches!!!!!"

This movie really reveals the meaning of Christmas by revealing what It is not about, which is materialism or gifts. By grabbing hold of and finding the strength of the very merry, holly and jolly Christmas, he saves everyone's Christmas instead of stealing or ruining it.

I think I will give it 7, because it made my Christmas a bit better. Bon soir. Goodnight. Guten nacht. God natt. Buenos Noches. Peace & Love God Bless Shevy

I agree completely, this film looks extremely overblown, and it is.Though the sets and costumes are visually amazing, they go by too fast too be truly appreciated, and there is the feeling that it is too much crammed into too little.  Besides this, the supporting cast have very little to do, and the presence of Anthony Hopkins as the narrator is rather puzzling.  Besides that, several weak story points are added, for instance, like the romance between the Grinch and Martha May seems completely superfluous.  However, if you want to see this movie, see for Jim Carrey, who steals the show as the title role.  He is simply hilarious!  He does, however, run a close race against Cindy Lou Who, who is unbelievably cute.The difference between this movie, and the cartoon, is that this movie is set more from the point of view of the Grinch.  In the cartoon, the Grinch is the villain, a grumpy old hermit who is jealous of the Whos and their happiness.  The Whos, in the cartoon, are just simple, country townsfolk celebrating Christmas, and when the Grinch finds he cannot destroy Christmas, he knows he cannot make them suffer the absence he feels in his life, and finally understands the holiday spirit. In the movie, however, the Grinch is a slightly more modern take on his character.  Actually, you can't blame him for wanting to do something about the Whos, who, in this movie, are a grim reflection of our society, and the crass consumerism and capitalism that yearly chokes the true meaning of the holiday spirit for material possessions.  The Whos are so immersed in their own greed that it almost seems they deserve it when the Grinch drops the ball on them.  The writers also make them seem as irritating and overly cheerful and loud as possible, with their gaudy decorations and foods, and creepy, sugar-coated style.  Cindy Lou's reaction to this is our own, and she and the Grinch find the real meaning of the holiday.  She and the Grinch are better seen as role models to today's holiday company, as a message not to lose ourselves in our own material greed that has become common to this holiday, but to instead remember what Christmas is.  I think this holiday would get a much better reputation if people made it a routine to imagine a Christmas without presents or trimmings every year, just to keep that image in mind.  But, if you don't want to be annoyed by the Whos, or blinded by the slightly overdone sets and costumes, watch it for Cindy Lou, or, if you don't like 'cute' movies like me, but like Jim Carrey's raunchy, slapstick, Marx Bros. style comedy, watch it for him.

A big part of me hates this movie. It's overblown, the simplicity of the original story is smashed, and the look of the film is garish. They turned the Whos into smug materialists instead of the kind-hearted, wise folks who loved Christmas because it was a time of love and fellowship. Also, no one can replace Boris Karloff as the Grinch. Ever.Still, I cannot deny this film is a major guilty pleasure for me. Jim Carrey is over-the-top and ridiculous, but his overplaying makes me laugh (and I must admit, the make-up on him is fantastic). The disgusting-looking Whos are so terrible-looking, but that's hilarious too. Everything they could have got wrong went wrong, but it's done in such a stupid manner that it makes it kind of charming in a weird, surreal way.I wouldn't recommend it, but at the same time, if you want to do some MST3K for a holiday movie and got tired of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, then this is the flick for you.

(possible spoilers)Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T). When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us.The film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are underminedsomewhat by the rather hazy cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much betteruse of a high budget) turned in. Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked). This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation).The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensivelyhypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandisingcampaign.The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character). Sheseems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character.Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in theirstockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart. The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today. Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!

This movie was never intended to win an Oscar, but for what it is, this movie is an absolute Christmas classic. I was a kid when I saw this in theaters and it still makes me crack up at 28. Jim Carrey is hilarious as the Grinch!

If you enjoyed the cartoon version, you'll enjoy this more. The setting and makeup really makes this look like a Dr. Seuss film, freaking Jim Carrey as The Grinch is the best thing out of this movie...that's all I have to say.

As usual, any film that Carrey is in becomes more about him than the story. Dr Seuss is rolling in his grave.
