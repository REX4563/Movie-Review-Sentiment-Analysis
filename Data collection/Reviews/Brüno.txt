Brüno is a good movie with a very good set up for very cringe worthy hidden camera comedy and a very risky performance from Sacha Baron Cohen ,not his best movie,but it's definitely his most offensive.It will definitely offend many people and if you are easily offended definitely do not watch this movie.He visits some of the dark parts of Los Angeles that I didn't even know existed,particularly the straight camps and wrestling arena,which made the cringe in this movie so brilliant,I felt made about how much I was laughing at his jokes,because that's just the kind of movie it is,you realize its offensive,but you can stop yourself from laughing.Its certainly no Borat,but fans of Sacha Baron Cohens comedy will definitely enjoy Brüno. Brüno (Sacha Baron Cohen) a European fashion model,heads to Los Angeles to become a big celebrity by following his own steps in becoming famous.

The comparison between 'Brüno' and 'Borat' seems inevitable and even though 'Borat' tackles some relevant issues and constantly maintains its sense of very crude, offensive, outlandish and macabre humour 'Brüno' does the same but it's more toned down when compared to 'Borat'. Yet, even though the vulgarity is less in frequency when compared to 'Borat' at its crudest, 'Brüno' tops the aforementioned (hint: a swinging penis that talks). Needless to say, the comedic sequences are over the top (which is to be expected in a movie lead by Sacha Baron Cohen) but I found most of it hilarious, even overall funnier than 'Borat'. At the same time the film touches on some relevant issues for example when Brüno visits the gay converters or when he has parents audition for him to take a photograph with his kid. The movie makes fun of them but it also makes viewers aware of the existence of such people. The execution is well done. Even the score is ticklish at times. Overall, it's a hilarious little film but definitely not everyone's cup of coffee.

So I was able to attend an early screening tonight here in Houston, and it seems Bruno is touching some buttons here in America, I understand. Yes Bruno is a flaming stereotype of homosexuals but didn't Borat do the same thing? Cohen ran throughout America depicting Americans in uncomfortably stereotypical situations.If you loved Borat you will undoubtedly enjoy Bruno. It follows the same genuine formula found in Cohen's previous film, be as outrageous as possible with some slight classiness/taste and the austrian is exceptionally well at it.I really don't want to spoil anything for yall since the commercials/trailers have shown a lot but Bruno offers everything a great comedy can offer to you which in total means a great night at the movies.The only cons I can think of are some jokes fall flat but the great ones easily overshadow the bad ones.If you're easily offended by blatant nudity and controversial topics steer clear of Bruno but if you're open minded and ready to have an amazing night at the movies, I would buy your ticket for opening night ASAP.9/10

I watched the trailers and thought they were incredibly funny. But packed into those few minutes you will find all the best scenes from the film, and there's very little worth watching in the remainder.So yes, the film is shocking and pushes the boundaries (again) quite a bit further. And yes, it ridicules our society's obsession with celebrity status. But that in itself isn't enough to make it a good film. Bad acting and a terrible story line remain bad acting and a terrible storyline, even if it has been done on purpose (of which I am not even certain). In any case, it gives the film the doubtful qualities of a cheap 70s porn film.So what about the humour? Baron-Cohen has always looked for comedy in breaking the boundaries of social convention, and with Ali G and Borat that was often to great comic effect. But not so much in Bruno: cheap shock effect and trying to heap even more embarrassment on his victims appear to have been the main recipes of the film. It doesn't even work anymore: he's now so ridiculous that everyone storms out within the first minute. Porn scenes with a pygmy flight attendant, overacted dancing, a swinging penis (didn't we see that in EuroTrash yeeeears ago?), lowering your trousers in front of a US presidential candidate... it may be funny to some, to me it just stinks.By the time it came to scenes that *could* have been funny (like the day-time television talk show) - I had properly tuned out, and much of its potential fun was lost on me.My advice: watch the trailers, laugh your head off, then just be happy with the idea of a brilliant film that could have been, but wasn't made. If you do go, be prepared for disappointment, lots of cringing and the hohoho-type nervous laughter of embarrassment.

How does Borat have a 7.3 and this only a 5.8? Both movies follow basically the same formula: A crazy, super exaggerated walking stereotype played by Sacha Baron Cohen goes to America, getting involved in wacky antics and meeting some celebrities along the way, often in front of real unsuspecting crowds. Do people hate this movie because its the same formula again? I guess you could argue Borat is a little funnier than Bruno, but even still, its hard to get a laugh out of me and I involuntarily burst out laughing at least 15 or 20 times. Is it because of offensive, overly exaggerated gay stereotypes? I know this movie goes a bit far at points, but come on people, have a sense of humor! Pointing out Americans' ignorance of foreigners with funny accents is OK but doing the same thing with gays is too much? Sure. I often find myself rating movies lower than the average score, but this is a great movie, and I'd easily give it a 7 or 8. I honestly have no idea where the hate for this movie is coming from. Granted, its a HARD R and some of its more extreme content might be a little off putting to some, but come on people, this movie is hilarious!

BRUNO (2009) ** Sacha Baron Cohen does it again: unleashing an obnoxious foreigner on the unitiated American populace, this time in the form of the titular flamboyantly gay Austrian fashionista who desires nothing but to be famous and will go to no depths (high or low, well, come on really low) to do so regardless of his own obnoxiousness and outrageous behavior. For the most part it is a rehash of BORAT but with more of a browbeating bull-in-a-China shop-approach with more misses than hits; while there a few funny moments sprinkled about (i.e. usurping an LA PR firm's vapidity is like shooting fish in a barrel). The jokes are strained, vulgar and in a word: passe. You've been warned. (Dir: Larry Charles)

Now I want to get one thing straight, I really wanted to love this movie, Sacha Baron Cohen is a consistently funny and shocking comedian that takes the most absurd characters putting them into situations that not only make people uncomfortable but react in a way that makes you laugh so hard that it makes your stomach hurt. After seeing the trailer for Brüno, I don't think I even need to say this, everyone wanted to see where Sacha would go after Borat and Brüno looked like an incredibly funny movie. I consider myself a liberal person, I don't mind the "shock" humor of today, but my problem with this movie is that it's hurting more than harmless humor. I have a few homosexual friends who are struggling to be taken seriously in life and this movie is honestly setting them back. My thing is that if Sacha had a message in the film vs. just mocking not just a country but other people, the film would have worked a lot better.Gay Austrian fashion reporter Brüno is fired from his show after disrupting a catwalk show during Fashion week. Accompanied by his assistant's assistant Lutz, he travels to the United States to become a superstar. After a pilot of a celebrity interview show bombs with a test audience, he attempts to become famous via various other methods. In an attempt to create a sex tape, he arranges an interview with Ron Paul, and while the two wait for a staged technical problem to be fixed, Brüno starts hitting on Paul. He consults PR consultants to select a world problem he can tackle to maximize his fame with a minimum of effort. He flies to Jerusalem where he interviews former Mossad agent Yossi Alpher and Palestinian politician Ghassan Khatib in which Brüno asks silly questions and gets kicked out of the country. On a TV talk show hosted by Richard Bey, he shows the African American audience a Black baby named O.J., whom he acquired in Africa by swapping him for an iPod. The audience is appalled. Social Services take the boy away from Brüno, driving him into severe depression. After realizing that the biggest names in Hollywood are straight, Brüno consults two Christian gay converters to become heterosexual.Brüno is Borat with a different character, it seems like Sacha is just relying on shock over actual humor now. Although I'm actually curious what the unrated DVD is going to look like because this might as well have been a porno. For God's sake they have a scene that Brüno goes to a swinger's party and there is just full frontal, back, side, everything you can imagine in a porno is in this scene. Not to mention there's a sex scene in the beginning with Brüno and his boyfriend that is just plain disturbing that involves a bike connected to a dildo that pleasures Brüno while his boyfriend exercises and it's a bit much for most to handle. Then Brüno speaks to a "gay converter" to become straight that was just over the top offensive not just from Brüno's lines but also the leader of this group who clearly is hiding behind God's skirt. Now if this is your kind of humor, honestly, I'm not sure if I'd want to know you because this is the humor that is more stupid and hurts people vs. just having fun. I wouldn't really recommend for people to run out and watch this trash, I hate to say it, Brüno was too offensive and that's saying a lot from me considering that I thought Borat was hilarious.2/10

As a child of the age of Aquarius, I found myself liking this movie. I thought it was completely hilarious in an unusual way. When Brüno puts himself in various situations (and some dangerous situations), and finds himself speechless; it almost makes you think that Sascha Baron Cohen couldn't possibly come up with any semblance of a clever retort. But exactly at those times is when he wows you with his virtuoso-like skill of improvisation. If I wasn't when I saw Borat, I am now completely convinced that Cohen is a genius. I highly recommend watching the DVD for its alternate, deleted, and extended scenes; and a highly pertinent interview with Brüno's unknowing agent after the fact. I highly recommend this movie, if for his skill at making a story into the various peoples he meets.

Saw the film last night in Munich/Germany. Although I found the movie quite funny (especially the first part) and the audience even applauded at the end, I am damn sure, that a lot of the scenes where staged and performed by actors, which somehow ruins the film. Unlike Borat, where Cohen pretended to be a reporter, which made cameras around him an obvious thing, Brüno is shot in a different way, with a lot of cuts, very clear pictures, from several ankles and most of all with no real reason, why the scenes should be taped by a camera team. This was most obvious in the swinger club scene. Consequently I am certain that a lot of scenes are played by actors. That dampens the fun tremendously; at least for me.

Where do I even start with this terrible movie? We've all seen the previews with some funny one-liners, and yes, those one liners were amusing. But it's like they used them all up, and everything you see in the previews, that's IT. There are no other funny lines in the film other than what you see in the previews. I made it through exactly 35 minutes of this movie before I had to leave. It was just plain offensive on so many levels (and as a "liberal" it takes a lot to offend me). I literally have dozens of gay friends and I've never met anyone like the Bruno character. And the way the film portrays other races and groups......again, offensive. All the stereotypes portrayed in the movie (gay, black, middle Eastern, etc.) have all been done ad nauseum, and were portrayed disrespectfully. Is this all that Cohen can do? What a piece of crap. Is he trying to shock us? If he is, he didn't succeed with the movie's content. What shocks me is that I was suckered into paying 8 bucks for the ticket. Do not waste your time or money.

The character of Bruno is intended to be something of a funhouse mirror of the fashion world's perpetually insular world of name designers and hangers on who are completely unknown outside of their circle. The problem is that the fashion world thrives on its own ridiculousness: its already self satirizing. Thus while Bruno's fashion world hits worked well as bits interspersed between other characters on the Ali-G show, the fashion aspect of the character can't support a entire feature length film. Bruno is also a celebrity star-f*cker, but another problem lies there: Cohen is beholden to the same PR world to sell his movie, and too well known in that community to trick any of the media targets that are ripe for his blend of satire. With the comedy potential of those avenues largely blunted, Cohen is forced to amplify the gay aspect of the character to compensate and carry the weight. This is risky: all groups that engage in identity politics are hypersensitive to how they are portrayed in the media, and the Gay/Lesbian community particularly so. Its understandable given the long, and unfortunately continuing history of being used as a political wedge to win elections and the resultant social collateral damage: discriminatory anti-gay laws, epithets and even violence. Even so, there is a lot of political incorrectness that can be forgiven if the result is funny or thought-provoking. The key to evaluating this film then is determining how successful it is at meeting those goals.The film follows the Borat template: exiled from the Euro fashion world, Bruno seeks another avenue of fame in the US, attended to by his mistreated assistant. The problem becomes apparent quickly. Unlike the Borat character who was able to elicit genuine responses because his behavior seemed to stem more from his background of poverty-based ignorance, Bruno is simply a self-serving a-hole. The sequences that play this up are the ones that don't work: Bruno goes hunting, Bruno joins the army, Bruno interviews some swingers. Bruno aims to provoke a homophobic response, but the "victims" seems to be responding less to Bruno being gay, than to Bruno being a jerk.The movie hits its low point with an attempted ambush of former presidential candidate Ron Paul. Of all of the right-wing figures that would make tempting targets, Paul is possibly the least interesting. Like his left wing counterpart Ralph Nader, Paul is a true believer in his stances, and agree with him or not, he votes and lives his own life in accordance with them. On the hypocrisy scale, he's pretty far down the list. In that scene an attempted seduction results in a weird inversion: your not laughing at Paul (who you kind of feel sorry for), you're laughing at how stupid Bruno's awkward seduction attempt is. As he is exiting, Paul gets caught on camera saying "that guy is a queer", which given the circumstances actually comes off as forgivable. This is the problem at the core of the film: the reactions to some of Bruno's behavior read as legitimate, even when they should be indefensible. Unlike Borat's attempts at freaking the mundanes, which similarly aimed at exposing the ignorance and prejudices of the targets, Bruno's reinforce their negative perception by causing the people to react to his behavior and then positing that behavior as "gay". Bruno is a deliberately ugly and ill mannered ambassador. The counter-argument the filmmakers may give is that only ignorant people would read this over the top character as representative. That may or may not be true. I think they underestimate how many ignorant people there are out there.Supposing they are correct, Bruno ultimately may be a film ahead of its time. There remains a pretty sharp dividing line regarding gay acceptance between the baby boom and older generations and Gen X and Y. The older generations came of age when there was little gay visibility in the media, and being gay itself was criminal and even classified as a mental disorder. Gen's X&Y grew up with much more exposure, with X-ers getting a daily dose of Paul Lynde on afternoon TV and John Ritter camping it up on Three's Company, and Gen Y growing up with any number of out celebrities, politicians, media figures, as well as internet exposure to every sexual fetish known to mankind, which has the effect of making garden variety homosexuality normally, boringly, commonplace. It would not be surprising to see if there is a similar divide in how Bruno is interpreted.For all of the problems, the movie has some very funny moments, and most of them occur when the film is successful at shifting the focus away from Bruno onto the people he is interacting with. A sequence featuring parents who tell a talent agent how much they are willing to torture their children works well, also, Bruno interacting with a Jerry Springer-type black talk show audience, Bruno seeking anti-gay religious therapy, and Bruno and assistant trussed up in an enormous amount of S&M gear chasing after the "God Hates f*gs" people. A sequence set in the middle east takes what seems like (on paper) a stupid joke confusing "Hamas", and "Hummus", and raises it to a near dadaist level, ending with Bruno singing a warbled peace song while forcing Israeli and Palestinian debaters to awkwardly hold hands.The film climaxes with the best sequence: Bruno dressed in Ted Nugent drag working a drunken redneck audience into frenzy before engaging in a ultimate fighting style cage match. It becomes a quick reversal in which punching and kicking evolves into making out and mutual stripping. Its a nervy and hilarious sequence which demonstrates actual anti-gay hate and violence, and it works largely because the gay-ness in it is divorced from the accoutrements of the Bruno character. It feels like genuine reaction, and it could have been the perfect ending to a better movie.

Sasha Baron Cohen stars as his alter-ego Bruno the Austrian fashionista from Funkyzeit.This film tracks the misadventures of Bruno through a series of tragic comedic adventures and outrageous stunts.It hardly compares to the crass and over-hyped Borat which sold on its shock value alone.One feels that perhaps Ali G, Borat and Bruno have past their sell-by date, but this remains a film that will provide some R rated entertainment for a decidedly niche market.For fans of the comedic genius of Cohen, this character is certainly camp, flambuoyant and zany, but the humor is wearing thin and the acting is sub-standard.Worth watching, if only to complete the trifecta.

It's hard to imagine "spoiling" a film like Bruno: there's really no story, and the jokes are all about how they're executed, so whatever you've heard in advance surely won't ruin your fun. I mean, telling you that in one scene Bruno is undergoing "anal bleaching" while talking to his agent in Hollywood will subtract nothing from the shock and possible hilarity of what you're going to see on screen.No, there's no way anything outside of the film can ruin it. The problem lies entirely within its frames. Think of Limburger Cheese. That pungent flavor and stunning odor are its normal properties. And few people choose to eat it.When my wife and I saw it yesterday our reaction was "mixed" to say the least. I found myself alternately cringing and laughing; my wife alternately cringed and asked me if I was ready to leave yet. For me, the film's flaws were not so serious that I felt that if I ate one more piece of it I'd refund my popcorn, but my wife's gag reflex was stronger, and so we left the theater before the film ended.For us the most offensive aspects of Bruno did not involve the over-generous displays of backsides and genitalia. Even when Bruno's sizable penis got blown up to an on-screen size of about 3 to 4 feet, our only comment was that we were glad that the movie was not photographed in 3D.But the conceit of the film is that our society's hypocritical preoccupations with celebrity and other-people's sexuality make many of us fair game for gotcha exposure. "Look at these fools who'll do anything to get themselves or their kids on camera!" "And look at these benighted dolts--both the bible-thumping red-necks from the rural South and the pseudo-sophisticates in the coastal big cities; don't they deserve to have a big man-butt wagged in their faces so we can laugh at them when they get mad?" Those are the questions Bruno poses. His lack of cleverness actually made me feel sympathy for people who usually burn me up. I'm no Ron Paul fan. I find his brand of Libertarian-Republicanism to be far too conservative, frankly. But Bruno's vulgar mock interview with him seemed undeserved. Dr. Paul is a decent, pretty broad-minded fellow. Bruno came off looking like an ignorant fool.Similarly, his excruciating farcical peace-making session with an Israeli hard-liner and a representative of Hamas did nothing to point out the shortcomings of the two intransigent enemies. If it did anything it made me feel sorry for two aging politicians whose jobs require spending endless hours in boring, frustrating, fruitless meetings. Mr. Baron-Cohen seems to believe that by adding a few hours of mortification to their lives he is somehow adding something to someone's understanding of the slaughter-factory known as the Middle East.The people responsible for this film are very talented. I have enjoyed some of their other efforts. In spite of the amount of derrière shown in this movie it struck me as half-assed. You can do better, guys. Use some of that other big organ you've got, Sascha, your BRAIN!

In an interview in Sweden the South Park creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, are asked about the reactions that their 2004 film Team America had in the United States. They say that most people really liked it but that a section of people that really hated it. It was basically the same that always happens with their stuff, they say that pretty much the section of people that hate their stuff is always sort of changing (in the case of Team America it was the extreme-left, for the most part) but there's always present, which, they add, is good and pretty normal due to the subject matter and basically if every single person likes something they did they would be wondering...and they would be like Shrek! Obviously the latest Sacha Baron Cohen/Larry Charles production (the film of Cohen's character Brüno, who is a gay Austrian fashion reporter) is not a Shrek. Brüno was released back in July in the US but just last Friday in Mexico City. I don't think here it will be in theaters more than this first week, today I saw it and aside of my familiars and me in the theater were just about 5 other persons. Having seen Borat (for me not only Sacha Baron Cohen's masterwork but also the most hilarious film of the decade so far) I knew exactly what was going to be Brüno then basically if you enjoyed Borat you will have a truly great time watching this, otherwise you will want to do what a couple that was in the theater today did: leave the theater in the middle of the film, or press the stop button and throw away the DVD/Blu-Ray (yes, while here in Mexico it just arrived a couple of days ago its DVD and Blu- Ray release is near). I don't think I should write a lot about Bruno since it is basically a Borat, still I will add some more words. The first laughs came (I must add that aside of that couple the other few people in the audience laughed as hard as me, which was really really hard!) when nobody was yet in the screen, just the first sounds, the first seconds of the song "Nessaja", you'll know why! Cohen's show starts and, like Roger Ebert pointed out, it "doesn't contain 30 boring seconds". We have of course a plot or well we have Brüno after losing everything he had as a successful fashion reporter (including his lover Diesel; I guess at the part when Brüno drinks champagne and do other stuff with Diesel some were and will be like "that's enough, f*** this movie". I don't think the runtime marks more than 10 minutes when that part happens!), now he will go to the land of opportunities and will try to become a very famous star, "the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler" to be exact. Many great dialog like that one and of course all those reactions of the people that meet Brüno during his journey to become a star ("there's a lot of African Americans in Africa!" "No! There's a lot of Africans in Africa!" "That's racist!"). And he tries many things during that journey: to become an actor (he has to be the most active then annoying extra ever!), an interviewer of Hollywood celebrities (Harrison Ford is here, yet...) for his own TV show (the pilot is "worse than cancer" for its audience and well, just extremely f****** gay and hilarious!), the protagonist of a sex tape (poor Ron Paul!), involved in the charity work (what's in?, asks Brüno to the experts and hell, these experts, Nicole and Suzanne DeFosset, take the cake as the dumbest and most hilarious "guests" in the film! Still those parents of the child photo models are quite up there!) and some other things. All of that sounds quite hilarious, right? Well, the film gets funnier when Brüno tries to become straight (since stars like Cruise, Travolta and Spacey are straight!). Is greatly structured with Brüno talking with Christian converters and in between doing the activities like hunting and learning to fight against dildos (!). Enough, I just add that Brüno is definitely one of my favourites of the year.

Where Borat was gormless and ignorantly charming, Bruno is calculated and ruthlessly seeking publicity. This is as I see it the key difference and the primary drawback of the film, at least when compared with Borat.This leads to a situation where Bruno attacks the superficial and those lacking intelligence, in other words the easy targets.Look at these attacks: - Models are stupid and vacuous. - People in the film industry are judgmental. - Californian women are superficial and dumb. - People from the Southern states of the US are homophobic and largely uneducated.This is the equivalent of saying that George Bush is stupid, politicians are corrupt and (up until recently) you wouldn't want Michael Jackson babysitting your kids. (For some reason he is now a saint again in death.)The best laughs in Bruno happen where he pushes himself into situations far beyond what the ordinary citizen would deem out there. There is a seance that really must be seen once - then hopefully forgotten - a sight gag on Bruno's pilot that is at once gross and ludicrously hilarious, a failed bondage session and a finale that I think petered out simply because (being heterosexual) Baron Cohen couldn't bring himself to go further. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand boundaries, but if you really want to push the boundaries the next illogical step is to go the whole hog (so to speak). To paraphrase Tropic Thunder: Bruno goes half gay, instead of full gay, except this is exactly where the audience can tell that they are watching a button pushing film, instead of a no holds barred film.I have no idea why I just wrote a paragraph suggesting that a film should be more gay, but there you go. If you got this far you know you are going to watch it anyway, and I would never say not to, but this is an exercise in creating controversy, and not the classic mock doc that some might lead you to believe.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Again mercifully only 80 minutes, but this time in between the bits you'll talk about at work are prolonged segments of boredom totaling around 70 minutes. I looked at my watch way too much for it to be healthy.Verdict - Ultimately I found my experiences watching Borat and Bruno almost back to back, I have decided that the films are much like the principal characters.Borat is dumb yet likable. Bruno is dumb, vacuous and simply tries to hard in the end. Also, Sacha Baron Cohen is a victim of himself, after Borat, it's been done.Clear advantage – Borat.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com

with much anticipation i took my girlfriend to see Bruno. it looked funny from the previews, as our TV has been bombarded with commercials to see the funniest movie of the summer. well, i'm still waiting. it was the most unfunny and offensive movie i have ever seen in my life. for the first time i actually asked for(and received) a full refund. now i can laugh at almost anything, and Borat was hysterically funny, so please don't think of me as a prude, but i found nothing funny about Bruno. it was mean spirited in its attempt at humor. at a Saturday afternoon matinée, there were 8 people total in a theater seating 300. we walked out after 30 minutes. we should have left sooner.in one scene Bruno is showing his idea of a talk show to a focus group that turns out to be a perfect microcosm of the movie. it was as unfunny as cancer said one viewer. i would stab my eyes out with pencils, said a 2nd focus member. you would have to borrow the pencils from me first said the 1st focus member. sadly i had no pencils!

Granted, the DVD I rented began to skip about halfway through the film and I didn't see the whole movie, I believe that the only reason that this movie doesn't get the same reviews as Borat is because the American audience is too uptight. Yes, the movie is gross and at times cringe-inducing. Some of the more extreme scenes could have been hampered down, but I believe at the expense of the humor. Posters say they have never met anyone like Bruno, however have they ever met anyone like Borat. Neither exist in the real world and that is why the movie works. Cohen is a brilliant improviser and always two steps ahead of his targets. Some of the pranks don't deliver, but that's okay. I admire his audacity. For all the people who say it was too gross, imagine if the film was filled with explicit heterosexual sex, I'm sure the reaction would be much different. The aversion to this movie is primarily because there is a deep seated disgust to homosexual activity within the American psyche and even the most tolerant liberal is likely to be disgusted at some point. That's okay, that is why the movie works, it asks us what it is and why we are appalled.

Bruno, the gay Austrian media celebrity, cares more about his image than what he does to offend anyone curious enough to listen to what he has to say. His love life centers around Diesel, a pint sized flight attendant with whom he practices all kinds of kinky sex. Bruno, covering the Milan fashion shows, decides to go in his Velcro costume that turns out to be the beginning of his own downfall among the fashionistas.In order to reinvent himself, Bruno decides to settle in Los Angeles, where he figures he will be a celebrity. Well, unfortunately, Bruno manages to do everything wrong as he tries his hand in different projects. He even offends Paula Abdul when he invites her to his empty home where he asks her to sit on some Mexican workers' back because the lack of furniture. Bruno even infuriates a politician, Ron Paul, a Republican politician, mistaking him for Rue Paul, the famous gay icon.In an attempt to reinvent himself, again, he goes to the Middle East and Africa, thinking that if Angelina and Madonna came back with black babies, so can he. The boy, Bruno thinks, will help him gain friends back in America, where he returns to try to restart his dying career. When the break he was expecting, the appearance on a Dallas talk show, further alienates him from possible audiences, he decides he must cure his gay image.Going into the deep South, Bruno goes to get advice from a pastor, without any results. When he tries to surround himself with some red neck hunters, he realizes he needs more therapy to "ungay" himself. After trying everything, Bruno reincarnates into a wrestling personality that is pure macho. Unfortunately, some habits are hard to eradicate, so he finds himself booed in an arena when his loyal companion Lutz comes to Bruno in an unexpected finale.Sacha Baron Cohen loves to provoke and audience. As he proved with his "Borat", he is in a mood to make fun. Mr. Cohen is not politically correct; he has a little bit for everyone. This funny man is irreverent, but he is able to capture a lot that is true in many of the themes he touches. Directed by Larry Charles who had already worked with the comedian in Borat.Sacha Baron Cohen's Bruno is a talented man that shows his versatility for our enjoyment. Audiences should be forewarned that "Bruno" is not for everyone. Gustaf Hammersten is perfect as Lutz. One can only hope Mr. Cohen will not delay his next film.

I just saw it and I was a bit let down. I am gay, I love Cohen, and was ready to laugh. But the problem was he didn't expose any under-the-surface bigotry like he did in Borat. He overdid his "gayness" to such a violent extreme that he forced reactions out of people, some of whom are probably plenty openminded. You ended feeling sorry for these people.Especially Ron Paul, who out of all the politicians Cohen could have chosen, deserved it the least. He's no champion of gay rights, but he is certainly not an enemy either and he reacted like any normal person would in that nightmarish situation. There were also some genuine bigots in the film, but Cohen goes to such an extreme to provoke them, by the time it gets to that point, who cares?There were funny moments, of course, Cohen is a funny man, but this movie lacks the bite Borat had. This was just an exercise in bad taste (which is fine, if that's what you're looking for).

In some ways, this movie is Sacha Baron Cohen's best work. His ability to completely and utterly humiliate some of society's worst people is absolutely on point at times, not least with the abhorrent talent show parents. On the other hand, it also contains some of his weakest and most off-putting material and many scenes are tedious and ridiculous. Overall, I think there is enough genius in here to consider it a success, but it certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea.

Brüno is a good movie with a very good set up for very cringe worthy hidden camera comedy and a very risky performance from Sacha Baron Cohen ,not his best movie,but it's definitely his most offensive.It will definitely offend many people and if you are easily offended definitely do not watch this movie.He visits some of the dark parts of Los Angeles that I didn't even know existed,particularly the straight camps and wrestling arena,which made the cringe in this movie so brilliant,I felt made about how much I was laughing at his jokes,because that's just the kind of movie it is,you realize its offensive,but you can stop yourself from laughing.Its certainly no Borat,but fans of Sacha Baron Cohens comedy will definitely enjoy Brüno. Brüno (Sacha Baron Cohen) a European fashion model,heads to Los Angeles to become a big celebrity by following his own steps in becoming famous.

The comparison between 'Brüno' and 'Borat' seems inevitable and even though 'Borat' tackles some relevant issues and constantly maintains its sense of very crude, offensive, outlandish and macabre humour 'Brüno' does the same but it's more toned down when compared to 'Borat'. Yet, even though the vulgarity is less in frequency when compared to 'Borat' at its crudest, 'Brüno' tops the aforementioned (hint: a swinging penis that talks). Needless to say, the comedic sequences are over the top (which is to be expected in a movie lead by Sacha Baron Cohen) but I found most of it hilarious, even overall funnier than 'Borat'. At the same time the film touches on some relevant issues for example when Brüno visits the gay converters or when he has parents audition for him to take a photograph with his kid. The movie makes fun of them but it also makes viewers aware of the existence of such people. The execution is well done. Even the score is ticklish at times. Overall, it's a hilarious little film but definitely not everyone's cup of coffee.

So I was able to attend an early screening tonight here in Houston, and it seems Bruno is touching some buttons here in America, I understand. Yes Bruno is a flaming stereotype of homosexuals but didn't Borat do the same thing? Cohen ran throughout America depicting Americans in uncomfortably stereotypical situations.If you loved Borat you will undoubtedly enjoy Bruno. It follows the same genuine formula found in Cohen's previous film, be as outrageous as possible with some slight classiness/taste and the austrian is exceptionally well at it.I really don't want to spoil anything for yall since the commercials/trailers have shown a lot but Bruno offers everything a great comedy can offer to you which in total means a great night at the movies.The only cons I can think of are some jokes fall flat but the great ones easily overshadow the bad ones.If you're easily offended by blatant nudity and controversial topics steer clear of Bruno but if you're open minded and ready to have an amazing night at the movies, I would buy your ticket for opening night ASAP.9/10

I watched the trailers and thought they were incredibly funny. But packed into those few minutes you will find all the best scenes from the film, and there's very little worth watching in the remainder.So yes, the film is shocking and pushes the boundaries (again) quite a bit further. And yes, it ridicules our society's obsession with celebrity status. But that in itself isn't enough to make it a good film. Bad acting and a terrible story line remain bad acting and a terrible storyline, even if it has been done on purpose (of which I am not even certain). In any case, it gives the film the doubtful qualities of a cheap 70s porn film.So what about the humour? Baron-Cohen has always looked for comedy in breaking the boundaries of social convention, and with Ali G and Borat that was often to great comic effect. But not so much in Bruno: cheap shock effect and trying to heap even more embarrassment on his victims appear to have been the main recipes of the film. It doesn't even work anymore: he's now so ridiculous that everyone storms out within the first minute. Porn scenes with a pygmy flight attendant, overacted dancing, a swinging penis (didn't we see that in EuroTrash yeeeears ago?), lowering your trousers in front of a US presidential candidate... it may be funny to some, to me it just stinks.By the time it came to scenes that *could* have been funny (like the day-time television talk show) - I had properly tuned out, and much of its potential fun was lost on me.My advice: watch the trailers, laugh your head off, then just be happy with the idea of a brilliant film that could have been, but wasn't made. If you do go, be prepared for disappointment, lots of cringing and the hohoho-type nervous laughter of embarrassment.

I remember pretending to go to sleep some nights and then waiting for my parents to go to bed. After the coast was clear I would sneak downstairs and watch HBO. One of my favorite shows, besides 'Real Sex', was 'Da Ali G Show'. I still try and catch it whenever its on now and it still is classic and timeless.I had no idea how they were going to pull it off but I saw 'Borat' in its opening weekend and I, along with the rest of the audience, laughed from start to finish. Borat was pretty close to perfect and definitely engaging and re-watchable. It was fresh and it was nice to see a movie that did not have a tired, recycled plot.It is hard to watch 'Bruno' without making comparisons to Bruno's first carnation on 'Da Ali G Show'. I was expecting something along the lines of Borat. I went into this film with the same hopes and expectations of 'Borat' and honestly the magic just was not there.The beauty of 'Borat' was in the reactions of the people interviewed. People were intolerant, racist and sexist. 'Borat' was a complete study of American ignorance and a great sociological experiment.There was ample opportunity for Cohen to capture this feeling again. Homophobia is a big issue today and I was really hoping to see some kind of exploration into the subject.It was there but not in the way I expected. It felt, to me at least, that Bruno was there to simply make everyone around him uncomfortable. This was funny the first time but it got a little stale. It would have been nice to see more in terms of intolerance.I also expected more in terms of parodying the shallowness and unpractical nature of the fashion industry. There were plenty of opportunities to take stabs at fashion but this was only done in the beginning.Without giving anything away there is a lot of shock and a great scene with Harrison Ford- but other than that it just seemed kind of under enthusiastic. I expected a lot more.

In 2006, I went to see a movie called "Borat" and found myself completely caught off guard for the hilarity that ensued. I thought it was easily one of the funniest movies I had ever seen, and I still think that.However, it left high expectations for whatever Sacha Baron Cohen would do next. When I first learned of the premise of "Bruno" I thought the concept was likely to be very humorous, but I was surprised when it wasn't.Amongst theatergoers (myself included) there was only scattered, uncomfortable laughter. Not like "Borat", where the audience was practically in stitches the whole time.The plot was pretty thin. In fact, I'd say they just threw something together to hang the "gags" on. I was left supremely disappointed, and won't be recommending "Bruno" to anyone.Skip it!

How does Borat have a 7.3 and this only a 5.8? Both movies follow basically the same formula: A crazy, super exaggerated walking stereotype played by Sacha Baron Cohen goes to America, getting involved in wacky antics and meeting some celebrities along the way, often in front of real unsuspecting crowds. Do people hate this movie because its the same formula again? I guess you could argue Borat is a little funnier than Bruno, but even still, its hard to get a laugh out of me and I involuntarily burst out laughing at least 15 or 20 times. Is it because of offensive, overly exaggerated gay stereotypes? I know this movie goes a bit far at points, but come on people, have a sense of humor! Pointing out Americans' ignorance of foreigners with funny accents is OK but doing the same thing with gays is too much? Sure. I often find myself rating movies lower than the average score, but this is a great movie, and I'd easily give it a 7 or 8. I honestly have no idea where the hate for this movie is coming from. Granted, its a HARD R and some of its more extreme content might be a little off putting to some, but come on people, this movie is hilarious!

BRUNO (2009) ** Sacha Baron Cohen does it again: unleashing an obnoxious foreigner on the unitiated American populace, this time in the form of the titular flamboyantly gay Austrian fashionista who desires nothing but to be famous and will go to no depths (high or low, well, come on really low) to do so regardless of his own obnoxiousness and outrageous behavior. For the most part it is a rehash of BORAT but with more of a browbeating bull-in-a-China shop-approach with more misses than hits; while there a few funny moments sprinkled about (i.e. usurping an LA PR firm's vapidity is like shooting fish in a barrel). The jokes are strained, vulgar and in a word: passe. You've been warned. (Dir: Larry Charles)

Now I want to get one thing straight, I really wanted to love this movie, Sacha Baron Cohen is a consistently funny and shocking comedian that takes the most absurd characters putting them into situations that not only make people uncomfortable but react in a way that makes you laugh so hard that it makes your stomach hurt. After seeing the trailer for Brüno, I don't think I even need to say this, everyone wanted to see where Sacha would go after Borat and Brüno looked like an incredibly funny movie. I consider myself a liberal person, I don't mind the "shock" humor of today, but my problem with this movie is that it's hurting more than harmless humor. I have a few homosexual friends who are struggling to be taken seriously in life and this movie is honestly setting them back. My thing is that if Sacha had a message in the film vs. just mocking not just a country but other people, the film would have worked a lot better.Gay Austrian fashion reporter Brüno is fired from his show after disrupting a catwalk show during Fashion week. Accompanied by his assistant's assistant Lutz, he travels to the United States to become a superstar. After a pilot of a celebrity interview show bombs with a test audience, he attempts to become famous via various other methods. In an attempt to create a sex tape, he arranges an interview with Ron Paul, and while the two wait for a staged technical problem to be fixed, Brüno starts hitting on Paul. He consults PR consultants to select a world problem he can tackle to maximize his fame with a minimum of effort. He flies to Jerusalem where he interviews former Mossad agent Yossi Alpher and Palestinian politician Ghassan Khatib in which Brüno asks silly questions and gets kicked out of the country. On a TV talk show hosted by Richard Bey, he shows the African American audience a Black baby named O.J., whom he acquired in Africa by swapping him for an iPod. The audience is appalled. Social Services take the boy away from Brüno, driving him into severe depression. After realizing that the biggest names in Hollywood are straight, Brüno consults two Christian gay converters to become heterosexual.Brüno is Borat with a different character, it seems like Sacha is just relying on shock over actual humor now. Although I'm actually curious what the unrated DVD is going to look like because this might as well have been a porno. For God's sake they have a scene that Brüno goes to a swinger's party and there is just full frontal, back, side, everything you can imagine in a porno is in this scene. Not to mention there's a sex scene in the beginning with Brüno and his boyfriend that is just plain disturbing that involves a bike connected to a dildo that pleasures Brüno while his boyfriend exercises and it's a bit much for most to handle. Then Brüno speaks to a "gay converter" to become straight that was just over the top offensive not just from Brüno's lines but also the leader of this group who clearly is hiding behind God's skirt. Now if this is your kind of humor, honestly, I'm not sure if I'd want to know you because this is the humor that is more stupid and hurts people vs. just having fun. I wouldn't really recommend for people to run out and watch this trash, I hate to say it, Brüno was too offensive and that's saying a lot from me considering that I thought Borat was hilarious.2/10

As a child of the age of Aquarius, I found myself liking this movie. I thought it was completely hilarious in an unusual way. When Brüno puts himself in various situations (and some dangerous situations), and finds himself speechless; it almost makes you think that Sascha Baron Cohen couldn't possibly come up with any semblance of a clever retort. But exactly at those times is when he wows you with his virtuoso-like skill of improvisation. If I wasn't when I saw Borat, I am now completely convinced that Cohen is a genius. I highly recommend watching the DVD for its alternate, deleted, and extended scenes; and a highly pertinent interview with Brüno's unknowing agent after the fact. I highly recommend this movie, if for his skill at making a story into the various peoples he meets.

Saw the film last night in Munich/Germany. Although I found the movie quite funny (especially the first part) and the audience even applauded at the end, I am damn sure, that a lot of the scenes where staged and performed by actors, which somehow ruins the film. Unlike Borat, where Cohen pretended to be a reporter, which made cameras around him an obvious thing, Brüno is shot in a different way, with a lot of cuts, very clear pictures, from several ankles and most of all with no real reason, why the scenes should be taped by a camera team. This was most obvious in the swinger club scene. Consequently I am certain that a lot of scenes are played by actors. That dampens the fun tremendously; at least for me.

Where do I even start with this terrible movie? We've all seen the previews with some funny one-liners, and yes, those one liners were amusing. But it's like they used them all up, and everything you see in the previews, that's IT. There are no other funny lines in the film other than what you see in the previews. I made it through exactly 35 minutes of this movie before I had to leave. It was just plain offensive on so many levels (and as a "liberal" it takes a lot to offend me). I literally have dozens of gay friends and I've never met anyone like the Bruno character. And the way the film portrays other races and groups......again, offensive. All the stereotypes portrayed in the movie (gay, black, middle Eastern, etc.) have all been done ad nauseum, and were portrayed disrespectfully. Is this all that Cohen can do? What a piece of crap. Is he trying to shock us? If he is, he didn't succeed with the movie's content. What shocks me is that I was suckered into paying 8 bucks for the ticket. Do not waste your time or money.

The character of Bruno is intended to be something of a funhouse mirror of the fashion world's perpetually insular world of name designers and hangers on who are completely unknown outside of their circle. The problem is that the fashion world thrives on its own ridiculousness: its already self satirizing. Thus while Bruno's fashion world hits worked well as bits interspersed between other characters on the Ali-G show, the fashion aspect of the character can't support a entire feature length film. Bruno is also a celebrity star-f*cker, but another problem lies there: Cohen is beholden to the same PR world to sell his movie, and too well known in that community to trick any of the media targets that are ripe for his blend of satire. With the comedy potential of those avenues largely blunted, Cohen is forced to amplify the gay aspect of the character to compensate and carry the weight. This is risky: all groups that engage in identity politics are hypersensitive to how they are portrayed in the media, and the Gay/Lesbian community particularly so. Its understandable given the long, and unfortunately continuing history of being used as a political wedge to win elections and the resultant social collateral damage: discriminatory anti-gay laws, epithets and even violence. Even so, there is a lot of political incorrectness that can be forgiven if the result is funny or thought-provoking. The key to evaluating this film then is determining how successful it is at meeting those goals.The film follows the Borat template: exiled from the Euro fashion world, Bruno seeks another avenue of fame in the US, attended to by his mistreated assistant. The problem becomes apparent quickly. Unlike the Borat character who was able to elicit genuine responses because his behavior seemed to stem more from his background of poverty-based ignorance, Bruno is simply a self-serving a-hole. The sequences that play this up are the ones that don't work: Bruno goes hunting, Bruno joins the army, Bruno interviews some swingers. Bruno aims to provoke a homophobic response, but the "victims" seems to be responding less to Bruno being gay, than to Bruno being a jerk.The movie hits its low point with an attempted ambush of former presidential candidate Ron Paul. Of all of the right-wing figures that would make tempting targets, Paul is possibly the least interesting. Like his left wing counterpart Ralph Nader, Paul is a true believer in his stances, and agree with him or not, he votes and lives his own life in accordance with them. On the hypocrisy scale, he's pretty far down the list. In that scene an attempted seduction results in a weird inversion: your not laughing at Paul (who you kind of feel sorry for), you're laughing at how stupid Bruno's awkward seduction attempt is. As he is exiting, Paul gets caught on camera saying "that guy is a queer", which given the circumstances actually comes off as forgivable. This is the problem at the core of the film: the reactions to some of Bruno's behavior read as legitimate, even when they should be indefensible. Unlike Borat's attempts at freaking the mundanes, which similarly aimed at exposing the ignorance and prejudices of the targets, Bruno's reinforce their negative perception by causing the people to react to his behavior and then positing that behavior as "gay". Bruno is a deliberately ugly and ill mannered ambassador. The counter-argument the filmmakers may give is that only ignorant people would read this over the top character as representative. That may or may not be true. I think they underestimate how many ignorant people there are out there.Supposing they are correct, Bruno ultimately may be a film ahead of its time. There remains a pretty sharp dividing line regarding gay acceptance between the baby boom and older generations and Gen X and Y. The older generations came of age when there was little gay visibility in the media, and being gay itself was criminal and even classified as a mental disorder. Gen's X&Y grew up with much more exposure, with X-ers getting a daily dose of Paul Lynde on afternoon TV and John Ritter camping it up on Three's Company, and Gen Y growing up with any number of out celebrities, politicians, media figures, as well as internet exposure to every sexual fetish known to mankind, which has the effect of making garden variety homosexuality normally, boringly, commonplace. It would not be surprising to see if there is a similar divide in how Bruno is interpreted.For all of the problems, the movie has some very funny moments, and most of them occur when the film is successful at shifting the focus away from Bruno onto the people he is interacting with. A sequence featuring parents who tell a talent agent how much they are willing to torture their children works well, also, Bruno interacting with a Jerry Springer-type black talk show audience, Bruno seeking anti-gay religious therapy, and Bruno and assistant trussed up in an enormous amount of S&M gear chasing after the "God Hates f*gs" people. A sequence set in the middle east takes what seems like (on paper) a stupid joke confusing "Hamas", and "Hummus", and raises it to a near dadaist level, ending with Bruno singing a warbled peace song while forcing Israeli and Palestinian debaters to awkwardly hold hands.The film climaxes with the best sequence: Bruno dressed in Ted Nugent drag working a drunken redneck audience into frenzy before engaging in a ultimate fighting style cage match. It becomes a quick reversal in which punching and kicking evolves into making out and mutual stripping. Its a nervy and hilarious sequence which demonstrates actual anti-gay hate and violence, and it works largely because the gay-ness in it is divorced from the accoutrements of the Bruno character. It feels like genuine reaction, and it could have been the perfect ending to a better movie.

Sasha Baron Cohen stars as his alter-ego Bruno the Austrian fashionista from Funkyzeit.This film tracks the misadventures of Bruno through a series of tragic comedic adventures and outrageous stunts.It hardly compares to the crass and over-hyped Borat which sold on its shock value alone.One feels that perhaps Ali G, Borat and Bruno have past their sell-by date, but this remains a film that will provide some R rated entertainment for a decidedly niche market.For fans of the comedic genius of Cohen, this character is certainly camp, flambuoyant and zany, but the humor is wearing thin and the acting is sub-standard.Worth watching, if only to complete the trifecta.

Having already been a long time fan or Sacha Baron Cohen' s Ali G television show and having already seen '06 Borat, I was expecting this film to be a little border line in it's humor. It's not so much clever as it is shocking. I mean, I think all the girls in the audience were more shocked than amused when without warning a penis is flopping around the screen. What the!?!? Here in N.Z. this film has a rating or R-16 which is ridiculous. R-18 should be the case but our chief censor has no idea what appropriate is obviously. I'm a manager for a cinema and we have already had various people walk out of Bruno in disgust. I mean come on, give me a break, most of us can all take a joke, I enjoy a good laugh as much as the next person and some.... SOME of this movie is really funny. But the endless barrage of penis/gay jokes and the very explicit Swingers party sex scenes are totally inappropriate and I'm obviously not the only one who thinks this as the opening weekend box office has taken a HUGE dive from opening day. Are we so desensitized with what is being portrayed in films these days that we have forgotten about good morals??? Do you a parent really want your daughter/son going to watch this sort of thing which is basically pornography. What ever happened to good clean fun movies??

I seriously doubt that most people on this site need an introduction to this film, but I'll throw one in anyway. The notorious comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, whose 2006 mockumentary Borat caused a wave of controversy due to the bulk of its humour consisting of the titular character, a weird hybrid of every politically incorrect stereotype about foreigners, being set loose on unsuspecting Americans and enacting one big practical joke on everyone he meets.Brüno follows virtually the same formula, except this time Cohen plays one entirely different character - a gay Austrian fashion reporter who's obsessed with the superficial culture of fashion, celebrities and sex. The plot (at least what there is) revolves around Brüno, once a famous Austrian fashion reporter, getting a bad reputation in the industry after ruining one particular fashion show. He sets off for America, hoping to achieve nothing more than to become famous. However, as you can expect, all his attempts to do so are multiple and disastrous.Okay, so onto the film itself - er, okay. Brüno very nearly got an NC-17 in America (and up until a few days before its Australian release, had an R18+ which was later worked down to MA15+, thus making it a little more "family-friendly") and even in what I suspect is an edited version, it still pushes the boundaries of good taste quite far. There were countless groans emanating from the audience as a result of sequences I probably can't describe in this review, but needless to say that if gross-out humour isn't your thing, you'd do best to steer away. Of course, that's pretty obvious, but what about the laugh factor for the people who can take it? Of course, this is just opinion, but Brüno is just not that funny. It's got a handful of good laughs spread across its brief running time, but they are spread rather thin and there are quite a few sequences that are both prolonged and largely (if not totally) unfunny. Whether he's doing some ridiculous pratfalls or maybe just some random off-the-cuff remark, there's plenty here that just seems like he's trying too hard to out-do Borat. That or he's not trying hard enough. I have no idea. Even the parts that I genuinely laughed at were parts that I knew were more or less on the same level as the ones I didn't laugh at, and I'm sure that other people will probably laugh at the parts I didn't like and vice versa. It makes the whole comedy aspect seem very uneven - given that most comedies aim to be consistently amusing all the way through, the sporadic nature of Brüno's humour is a strike against it.While I admit that it's actually not a bad film, it's not exactly great either. While Borat, for all its faults, was at least a reasonably fresh character-based take on the whole "candid camera" brand of comedy, Brüno falls fairly short by more or less repeating the exact same formula that Borat had, with the only real changes aimed at trying to push the envelope of good taste, and while it's still a fairly in-your-face experience, it's still not that great. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't try and expect a comedy blockbuster.

It's hard to imagine "spoiling" a film like Bruno: there's really no story, and the jokes are all about how they're executed, so whatever you've heard in advance surely won't ruin your fun. I mean, telling you that in one scene Bruno is undergoing "anal bleaching" while talking to his agent in Hollywood will subtract nothing from the shock and possible hilarity of what you're going to see on screen.No, there's no way anything outside of the film can ruin it. The problem lies entirely within its frames. Think of Limburger Cheese. That pungent flavor and stunning odor are its normal properties. And few people choose to eat it.When my wife and I saw it yesterday our reaction was "mixed" to say the least. I found myself alternately cringing and laughing; my wife alternately cringed and asked me if I was ready to leave yet. For me, the film's flaws were not so serious that I felt that if I ate one more piece of it I'd refund my popcorn, but my wife's gag reflex was stronger, and so we left the theater before the film ended.For us the most offensive aspects of Bruno did not involve the over-generous displays of backsides and genitalia. Even when Bruno's sizable penis got blown up to an on-screen size of about 3 to 4 feet, our only comment was that we were glad that the movie was not photographed in 3D.But the conceit of the film is that our society's hypocritical preoccupations with celebrity and other-people's sexuality make many of us fair game for gotcha exposure. "Look at these fools who'll do anything to get themselves or their kids on camera!" "And look at these benighted dolts--both the bible-thumping red-necks from the rural South and the pseudo-sophisticates in the coastal big cities; don't they deserve to have a big man-butt wagged in their faces so we can laugh at them when they get mad?" Those are the questions Bruno poses. His lack of cleverness actually made me feel sympathy for people who usually burn me up. I'm no Ron Paul fan. I find his brand of Libertarian-Republicanism to be far too conservative, frankly. But Bruno's vulgar mock interview with him seemed undeserved. Dr. Paul is a decent, pretty broad-minded fellow. Bruno came off looking like an ignorant fool.Similarly, his excruciating farcical peace-making session with an Israeli hard-liner and a representative of Hamas did nothing to point out the shortcomings of the two intransigent enemies. If it did anything it made me feel sorry for two aging politicians whose jobs require spending endless hours in boring, frustrating, fruitless meetings. Mr. Baron-Cohen seems to believe that by adding a few hours of mortification to their lives he is somehow adding something to someone's understanding of the slaughter-factory known as the Middle East.The people responsible for this film are very talented. I have enjoyed some of their other efforts. In spite of the amount of derrière shown in this movie it struck me as half-assed. You can do better, guys. Use some of that other big organ you've got, Sascha, your BRAIN!

In an interview in Sweden the South Park creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, are asked about the reactions that their 2004 film Team America had in the United States. They say that most people really liked it but that a section of people that really hated it. It was basically the same that always happens with their stuff, they say that pretty much the section of people that hate their stuff is always sort of changing (in the case of Team America it was the extreme-left, for the most part) but there's always present, which, they add, is good and pretty normal due to the subject matter and basically if every single person likes something they did they would be wondering...and they would be like Shrek! Obviously the latest Sacha Baron Cohen/Larry Charles production (the film of Cohen's character Brüno, who is a gay Austrian fashion reporter) is not a Shrek. Brüno was released back in July in the US but just last Friday in Mexico City. I don't think here it will be in theaters more than this first week, today I saw it and aside of my familiars and me in the theater were just about 5 other persons. Having seen Borat (for me not only Sacha Baron Cohen's masterwork but also the most hilarious film of the decade so far) I knew exactly what was going to be Brüno then basically if you enjoyed Borat you will have a truly great time watching this, otherwise you will want to do what a couple that was in the theater today did: leave the theater in the middle of the film, or press the stop button and throw away the DVD/Blu-Ray (yes, while here in Mexico it just arrived a couple of days ago its DVD and Blu- Ray release is near). I don't think I should write a lot about Bruno since it is basically a Borat, still I will add some more words. The first laughs came (I must add that aside of that couple the other few people in the audience laughed as hard as me, which was really really hard!) when nobody was yet in the screen, just the first sounds, the first seconds of the song "Nessaja", you'll know why! Cohen's show starts and, like Roger Ebert pointed out, it "doesn't contain 30 boring seconds". We have of course a plot or well we have Brüno after losing everything he had as a successful fashion reporter (including his lover Diesel; I guess at the part when Brüno drinks champagne and do other stuff with Diesel some were and will be like "that's enough, f*** this movie". I don't think the runtime marks more than 10 minutes when that part happens!), now he will go to the land of opportunities and will try to become a very famous star, "the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler" to be exact. Many great dialog like that one and of course all those reactions of the people that meet Brüno during his journey to become a star ("there's a lot of African Americans in Africa!" "No! There's a lot of Africans in Africa!" "That's racist!"). And he tries many things during that journey: to become an actor (he has to be the most active then annoying extra ever!), an interviewer of Hollywood celebrities (Harrison Ford is here, yet...) for his own TV show (the pilot is "worse than cancer" for its audience and well, just extremely f****** gay and hilarious!), the protagonist of a sex tape (poor Ron Paul!), involved in the charity work (what's in?, asks Brüno to the experts and hell, these experts, Nicole and Suzanne DeFosset, take the cake as the dumbest and most hilarious "guests" in the film! Still those parents of the child photo models are quite up there!) and some other things. All of that sounds quite hilarious, right? Well, the film gets funnier when Brüno tries to become straight (since stars like Cruise, Travolta and Spacey are straight!). Is greatly structured with Brüno talking with Christian converters and in between doing the activities like hunting and learning to fight against dildos (!). Enough, I just add that Brüno is definitely one of my favourites of the year.

Where Borat was gormless and ignorantly charming, Bruno is calculated and ruthlessly seeking publicity. This is as I see it the key difference and the primary drawback of the film, at least when compared with Borat.This leads to a situation where Bruno attacks the superficial and those lacking intelligence, in other words the easy targets.Look at these attacks: - Models are stupid and vacuous. - People in the film industry are judgmental. - Californian women are superficial and dumb. - People from the Southern states of the US are homophobic and largely uneducated.This is the equivalent of saying that George Bush is stupid, politicians are corrupt and (up until recently) you wouldn't want Michael Jackson babysitting your kids. (For some reason he is now a saint again in death.)The best laughs in Bruno happen where he pushes himself into situations far beyond what the ordinary citizen would deem out there. There is a seance that really must be seen once - then hopefully forgotten - a sight gag on Bruno's pilot that is at once gross and ludicrously hilarious, a failed bondage session and a finale that I think petered out simply because (being heterosexual) Baron Cohen couldn't bring himself to go further. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand boundaries, but if you really want to push the boundaries the next illogical step is to go the whole hog (so to speak). To paraphrase Tropic Thunder: Bruno goes half gay, instead of full gay, except this is exactly where the audience can tell that they are watching a button pushing film, instead of a no holds barred film.I have no idea why I just wrote a paragraph suggesting that a film should be more gay, but there you go. If you got this far you know you are going to watch it anyway, and I would never say not to, but this is an exercise in creating controversy, and not the classic mock doc that some might lead you to believe.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Again mercifully only 80 minutes, but this time in between the bits you'll talk about at work are prolonged segments of boredom totaling around 70 minutes. I looked at my watch way too much for it to be healthy.Verdict - Ultimately I found my experiences watching Borat and Bruno almost back to back, I have decided that the films are much like the principal characters.Borat is dumb yet likable. Bruno is dumb, vacuous and simply tries to hard in the end. Also, Sacha Baron Cohen is a victim of himself, after Borat, it's been done.Clear advantage – Borat.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com

with much anticipation i took my girlfriend to see Bruno. it looked funny from the previews, as our TV has been bombarded with commercials to see the funniest movie of the summer. well, i'm still waiting. it was the most unfunny and offensive movie i have ever seen in my life. for the first time i actually asked for(and received) a full refund. now i can laugh at almost anything, and Borat was hysterically funny, so please don't think of me as a prude, but i found nothing funny about Bruno. it was mean spirited in its attempt at humor. at a Saturday afternoon matinée, there were 8 people total in a theater seating 300. we walked out after 30 minutes. we should have left sooner.in one scene Bruno is showing his idea of a talk show to a focus group that turns out to be a perfect microcosm of the movie. it was as unfunny as cancer said one viewer. i would stab my eyes out with pencils, said a 2nd focus member. you would have to borrow the pencils from me first said the 1st focus member. sadly i had no pencils!

Granted, the DVD I rented began to skip about halfway through the film and I didn't see the whole movie, I believe that the only reason that this movie doesn't get the same reviews as Borat is because the American audience is too uptight. Yes, the movie is gross and at times cringe-inducing. Some of the more extreme scenes could have been hampered down, but I believe at the expense of the humor. Posters say they have never met anyone like Bruno, however have they ever met anyone like Borat. Neither exist in the real world and that is why the movie works. Cohen is a brilliant improviser and always two steps ahead of his targets. Some of the pranks don't deliver, but that's okay. I admire his audacity. For all the people who say it was too gross, imagine if the film was filled with explicit heterosexual sex, I'm sure the reaction would be much different. The aversion to this movie is primarily because there is a deep seated disgust to homosexual activity within the American psyche and even the most tolerant liberal is likely to be disgusted at some point. That's okay, that is why the movie works, it asks us what it is and why we are appalled.

Bruno, the gay Austrian media celebrity, cares more about his image than what he does to offend anyone curious enough to listen to what he has to say. His love life centers around Diesel, a pint sized flight attendant with whom he practices all kinds of kinky sex. Bruno, covering the Milan fashion shows, decides to go in his Velcro costume that turns out to be the beginning of his own downfall among the fashionistas.In order to reinvent himself, Bruno decides to settle in Los Angeles, where he figures he will be a celebrity. Well, unfortunately, Bruno manages to do everything wrong as he tries his hand in different projects. He even offends Paula Abdul when he invites her to his empty home where he asks her to sit on some Mexican workers' back because the lack of furniture. Bruno even infuriates a politician, Ron Paul, a Republican politician, mistaking him for Rue Paul, the famous gay icon.In an attempt to reinvent himself, again, he goes to the Middle East and Africa, thinking that if Angelina and Madonna came back with black babies, so can he. The boy, Bruno thinks, will help him gain friends back in America, where he returns to try to restart his dying career. When the break he was expecting, the appearance on a Dallas talk show, further alienates him from possible audiences, he decides he must cure his gay image.Going into the deep South, Bruno goes to get advice from a pastor, without any results. When he tries to surround himself with some red neck hunters, he realizes he needs more therapy to "ungay" himself. After trying everything, Bruno reincarnates into a wrestling personality that is pure macho. Unfortunately, some habits are hard to eradicate, so he finds himself booed in an arena when his loyal companion Lutz comes to Bruno in an unexpected finale.Sacha Baron Cohen loves to provoke and audience. As he proved with his "Borat", he is in a mood to make fun. Mr. Cohen is not politically correct; he has a little bit for everyone. This funny man is irreverent, but he is able to capture a lot that is true in many of the themes he touches. Directed by Larry Charles who had already worked with the comedian in Borat.Sacha Baron Cohen's Bruno is a talented man that shows his versatility for our enjoyment. Audiences should be forewarned that "Bruno" is not for everyone. Gustaf Hammersten is perfect as Lutz. One can only hope Mr. Cohen will not delay his next film.

Wow, I was really looking forward to this movie but, much to my dismay, it simply wasn't funny. It's a short movie - less than 90 minutes - and it seemed to go more for shock value than substance. I guess that it was assumed that shock value = funny = successful movie, but they were wrong. I would like to think that looking at a penis on screen would not send people rolling on the floor laughing in 2009. Too much of the movie seemed staged and rehearsed. Where as the surprise element was successful in the prior movie, here it was carefully choreographed and unbelievable. It reminded me of an old Simpsons episode, where the family is watching a gay parade and the participants are chanting, "We're here, we're queer, get used to it." A jaded Lisa Simpson says, "You say the same thing every year; we ARE used to it."
