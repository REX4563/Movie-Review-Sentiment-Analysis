I went into the cinema with friends and said: "It's a Farrelly Brothers film; you can guess the level of humour." There's Something About Mary I love, but let's face it -- the humour is quite crass, even if the movie does have some heart. So I expected another movie with jokes in bad taste, and lots of humour at the expense of conjoined twins. At least this is how the film has marketed it.  However, it couldn't be further from the truth. What has been marketed is quite different to what the film is about.Whilst the film does have humour -- some movements hilariously funny -- this film is at heart a light drama. And this is by certainly no means a bad thing. When I expected low-IQ humour, what I got was just a really engrossing tale of two brothers who just happen to be conjoined. The chemistry between Damon and Kinnear is just perfect, and the relationship between the brothers (no doubt written from experience by the Farrelly Brothers) was wonderful.Fox's marketing treatment of the film is appalling. In the trailer, Matt Damon's character says: "We're not Siamese, we're American," and the trailer plays it like he is stupid. Whereas in fact, when watching the film, the context is very different -- he's reacting with indignation, and in defence of their conjoined nature. This is indicative of the entire film. Never is their conjoined-nature used for humour in a bad way.Throw away what you've seen in the trailers, or what you think the film is about. Go and see this movie that has its heart so very much in the right place -- a great antidote to so many Hollywood films that have the soul of a stone. I don't normally get sentimental with films. I'm the type of viewer that laughs when Jack dies at the end of Titanic. But I went away from Stuck On You knowing I'd seen a very special film indeed. Highly recommended.

This turned out to be a surprisingly effective comedy.  Okay, sure, you can say that a movie that pokes fun at conjoined twins is in poor taste, but there's nothing malicious about it -- it feels, if you can believe it, genuine.You really get a sense of the tenderness and the bond that has developed between the two brothers.  Of course, as you'd expect from the Farrelly brothers, it's laugh-out-loud funny.  As you might not expect, there's not really any gross-out humor: it's more "Hal" than "Mary".  If you can't tell, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.Some gag highlights: Cher with her boyfriends, Matt Damon's stage fright, Greg Kinnear in a animal costume.

I was worried with the 5.6 rating this was going to be average at best but it's so well acted and delivered I can't understand who didn't like it.
It avoids cheap jokes at the expense of the brother's conjoined condition yet delivers laugh after laugh in a good-natured and fun way.
Damon and Kinnear deliver high quality character depth with warmth and charm, well above midnight double feature level and the star cast nods are icing on the cake.
The film is just good fun all the way through. Well worth the time to watch it and it seems it is a somewhat overlooked classy film.

Parts of this movie had me howling, although I'll warn you beforehand it's not like the other Farrelly bros films "There's Something About Mary" or "Dumb and Dumber". The laughs here are a lot cleaner, less edgy and pretty family friendly for the most part. Overall, the film is much more subtle, which is either good or bad depending on how you like your comedies.The humour here isn't as slapstick & madcap as you might expect from a movie about conjoined twins. Instead it's more subtle, almost like a Christopher Guest film ("Best in Show", "Waiting for Guffman"). For example one of the best gags is the idea that these conjoined twins (by definition, fraternal twins) look nothing alike. Can Matt Damon & Greg Kinnear look any LESS alike? There's currently an 8-page thread in the discussion board where people think it's a loophole, but ya just gotta smack your forehead. The film has a lot of gags like that where no punchline is required; it's just the situational weirdness that makes us laugh, if you're tuned in to it. Another subtle yet funny example is the way Eva Mendes reacts upon learning that the two are conjoined twins. Contrast this with the way Wenn Yan Shih reacts, and you have some comedy gold right there.If you like subtle humour, I think you'll like this film as well as the underratted knee-slappers "Color Me Kubrick" with John Malkovich, the classic "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with Michael Caine & Steve Martin, and a funny Mexican film I saw recently called "Casi Divas". These films may not have you convulsing in laughter, but afterwards I guarantee you'll say to yourself, "Dang that was funny."

This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Unorganized, useless plot, over-done sentimentality, and bad jokes. It was not funny, and the sheer stupidity of it made me want to break down and cry right in the middle of the theater. Its only good quality was-- oh, wait, sorry, there *were* no good qualities. My only thought leaving the theater was, "I am two hours closer to dying."Go see something else while I beg for my money back.

A great comedy, with a great script, wholesome message and a new, original story. Nuff said.

Stuck on You is a light sweet comedy. It takes a while to get going. Usually comedies are based on people insulting each other or being cruel to each other. This one is about conjoined twins who are kind and considerate to each other and to everyone else. It is a wonderful movie to take your kids to. These two are great role models. I have never seen a movie about conjoined twins, so all the gags were fresh for me. There is so much novel comic potential. My jaw dropped a number of times at the acrobatic skill of Greg Kinnear and Matt Matt Damon. I can't see how they could have done it with stunt doubles. They do an eye popping burger making ballet reminiscent of Tom Cruise in Cocktail. They have a fight that would put the Chinese martial artist dance moves to shame. Cher plays herself and spoofs herself. Meryl Street plays herself and spoofs her Mama Mia appearance in a musical Bonnie and Clyde. It was a romp and so much fun. The main plot as based around one of the twins wanting to be an actor while the other finds the idea abhorrent. They find ways to accommodate. It is a beautiful movie because the brothers so enjoy each other and care for the other's welfare. Their good will tends to rub off on everyone they encounter, in unexpected ways.

Since making the comedy of the 1990s in "There's Something About Mary", Bobby and Peter Farrelly have produced gentler fare for themselves and the greater Rhode Island area, sticking in just enough gross-out humor to deflect the "they-got-soft" buzz. But they have been getting softer, and not in a good way. Take "Stuck On You".It's the story of Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt Tenor (Greg Kinnear), conjoined twins remaking their lives when extroverted Walt pursues his acting dreams in Hollywood and introverted Bobby must go along for the ride. Walt finds sudden success while Bobby meets his dream girl, but will their new lives break up this inseparable pair?Acceptance is the overriding message of this film, and it's a nice message for a film that offers little else. At least I know better than to use the term "Siamese twins" now. Damon and Kinnear display nice chemistry, and I chuckled a couple of times.But the Farrellys seem more interested in displaying their humanity than making a funny film. Bob and Walt emote a lot about their hopes and dreams while everyone who ever sold the Farrellys a pizza is wedged into the background as an extra. You can feel them strain to hit the "feel-good" buttons and the punchlines.Alas, someone forgot the hair gel this time. The toothless gags play off the brothers' conjoined situation, but avoid any meanness. Instead it unrealistically tries to play off their situation as no big deal to anyone with half a heart. Like when Walt tells Bob of this hot woman he had drinks with the other night, only "I couldn't get her alone. She had that friend Ruthie with her like a freakin' shadow." They flip burgers and tend goal in a hockey game: "I had 11 saves and Bob had 26".The supporting cast is lackluster, not helped by a script that presents them as backboards for the brothers' banter or the fact that for so many of them, the casting call was the last Farrelly family barbecue. Seymour Cassell as an old agent wears a silly wig, while Cher sends herself up as Walt's unhappy co-star on a TV detective show.I liked isolated scenes, more in the beginning than in the mawkish and excessive second half when the twins cope with sudden success. There's a good scene early on when Walt is scoring with a girl while Bob on the other side of a shower curtain types an e-mail to his pen pal, unfazed by the fact his brother's activity keeps him bouncing up and down. Between positions, Walt tries to sneak a peak at his brother's e-mail. "It's personal," Bob says, pulling it away.That's a nice moment about boundaries, and enough of it shows up now and then for the film to not be a complete drag. You do care about the pair. Damon is good as shy Bob, while Kinnear impresses me, as he did with "Auto Focus", by getting the most out of lame dialogue with a raised eyebrow.Then he has to go and do one of his dead-on Ted Koppell impersonations, reminding you you are really watching a pair of actors strapped to a flesh-tone prosthetic. "Stuck On You" is not a bad idea for a comedy; it's just weakly delivered by a pair of brothers who themselves may have been stuck together too long.

There's something about this `Stuck on You' that sticks to me after my initial impression that the Farrelly Brothers have created another inane comedy to compete with their equally dubious `Dumb and Dumber' franchise, `Shallow Hal, ' and `There's Something about Mary,' among others. That something is taking a story about goofy conjoined twins (Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear), tossing in bathroom and masturbation jokes, and then seeing a basic metaphor about the loss people feel when separated from another human being with whom they have spent their lives.I commend the Farrellys because `Stuck on You' does not play for the broadest laughs but gently lampoons pretentious Hollywood and overtly praises the sincere emotions of two linked humans and the New England town that loves them regardless of their disability.  I liked the connection of two innocent, loving brothers, who miss each other after separation. I liked botoxed Cher's presence to emphasize the decayed humanity of L.A., which sees clearly the business profit in deformity.On another allegorical level, the twins could be the projection of the Farrellys themselves, going to Hollywood to exploit its penchant for seizing on the flavor of the month, regardless of its incorrectness or inhumanity and facing their own eventual split (Bobby is considering cutting back on their productions). The Farrellys are not the Coens, whose satire is more Kaufmans' `Adaptation' (Even if the brother is only imagined) than Zuckers' `Airplane.' But the Farrellys' five major motion pictures make them as bankable as any other successful brothers in the business.Seeing diva Cher make fun of herself and Meryl Streep cutup as co-star with Kinnear in a musical stage production of `Bonnie and Clyde'(Think `Springtime for Hitler') are a couple of reasons to see this film.  The best reason, however, is to enjoy the lighthearted interaction of two brothers who learn that nature's cruel marriage of their bodies gave them the best emotional marriage of their lives.  The Farrellys have confirmed the Karl Menninger belief that `to know one another well enough should not be to hate one another the more but to love one another the more.'Even those of us not conjoined could learn about brotherly  love from `Stuck on You.'

Peter and Bobby Farrelly, known collectively as the Farrelly brothers, took the comedy world by surprise in 1994, with a small but explosive comedy about a duo of very, very stupid friends: "Dumb and Dumber". Now regarded as one of the best and most influential comedies of the 90s, the movie became an instant hit and put the Farrelly brothers in the map. More than a decade after their successful debut, the Farrelly brothers have kept improving their well-known style of light hearted slapstick comedy, although the toilet humor they used frequently in their earlier movies has become a subtler (although no less outrageous) kind of comedy. "Stuck on You" follows this progression where toilet humor is replaced by some touches of charming drama in the story of a couple of sibling who just happen to be a bit too close from each other.Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt (Greg Kinnear), a couple of co-jointed twins living Martha's Vineyard where they have a small yet very successful fast food restaurant. While their condition is problematic at times, since they were kids the brothers made themselves the promise to never limit each other, so they have lived their lives to the max. However, Walt has an ambition: to be a Hollywood movie star. Bob knows Walt has the talent, but unlike him, he is more of a small town man, preferring the comfort of his town to the urban environment of L.A., but he has his own reasons to visit Hollywood, as his best friend May (Wen Yann Shih), whom he has met only via Internet, lives there and this may be his only chance to meet the love of his life.The Farrelly brothers, along with regular collaborators Charles B. Wessler and Bennett Yellin, have crafted a delightful script about the brother's relationship that respectfully deals with the twins' handicap, pretty much in the same way as "Shallow Hal" presented obesity. While their condition is certainly the film's main plot device, it is very important to point out that the source of the jokes is not the brother's handicap itself, but the people's reactions to them, and more importantly, the way they deal with their problems. Unlike most of the Farrelly's earlier movies, the film is very realistic, and never really offensive or exploitative in some way. The script is actually very funny, and with very well constructed characters (the twins' relationship may have been inspired by the directors' own relationship); it is this quality what makes "Stuck on You" to stand out, as the characters are so easy to sympathize with that it's hard to not like them.As directors, the brothers stay close to their successful formula of highly energetic slapstick, but as written above, the addition of drama to the story gives it a lot more heart than their previous offerings. The fact that, like "Shallow Hal", this comedy is a more character driven story, allows the brothers to showcase their progress as directors of actors and to prove that they is definitely more in their bag of tricks than an assortment of gross out jokes. In fact, the movie shows even less toilet humor than "Shallow Hal", and shows a couple of comedy directors than have finally reached the maturity of their craft. This is not to say that the movie lacks slapstick comedy, as the twins' handicap is often put to test to overcome the many obstacles of their life in Hollywood. However, as I said before, this done in more a championing and positive way than in humiliating or disrespectful way.Given that the film is entirely focus on the brothers, the actors portraying them have to not only be able to carry the film, they must completely work together as a team to pull off the roles believably. Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon are at first sight an unlikely pair for this kind of comedy, but surprisingly both manage to deliver a delightful performance as the brothers. With an amazing coordination and great talent for comedy, both actors manage to deliver realistic and very touching performances. It's safe to say that Damon is the weakest of the two, but that has more to do with Kinnear's remarkable scene stealing delivery than with any lack of talent in Damon's side. Eva Mendes is really the film's surprise by making a charming performance as April, the brother's enthusiastic neighbor in Hollywood who quickly becomes their best friend during their time in California.Certainly most fans will miss the gross out toilet humor of the earlier films, but the way the Farrelly brothers manage the subtle mix of comedy and drama of the film is more than enough to make up for that missing element. Often criticized for being exploitative of people's handicaps, with this movie the brothers prove that all that criticism was simply a misunderstanding of the siblings' comedy, as "Stuck on You" is anything but exploitative, and instead offers good insight about the problems that co-jointed twins' (or any other handicapped person for that matter) face when trying yo "fit" in the supposedly "normal society". This is certainly the film with most heart the brothers have ever done, and certainly one of their best. While one can certainly miss the freshness and irreverence of their earlier films, it's safe to say that by following this path the brothers soon will be delivering masterpieces of comedy."Stuck on You" was a big surprise for me, as probably like many people, I was expecting bad taste jokes and highly offensive exploitation. It was very refreshing to see that "Stuck on You" was very different than what I was expecting and turned out to be one of the most charming comedies the brothers have directed. With an excellent cast and most of all, a witty and intelligent script, this movie can proudly rank as one of the best comedies of the first decade of the 21st century. 7/10

This one's not really there, is it......it is only just sorta funny and more ridiculous in a clumsy way that ridiculous in an actual funny way. Personally, KINGPIN is an absolute scream from start to finish, IRENE is uproarious, MARY is hilarious, DUMB AND DUMBER is exactly that. SHALLOW HAL, I managed to miss. Me thinks the Farrelly's are spreading their fluids too thin and are in need of a creativity enema. However, I assume the accountants are begging for more and we will see this cycle of films fizzle like a Zucker. I just sat there through this one, hurrumphing occasionally and marvelling that Cher could move her mouth. Most of the audience were rustling and gargling occasionally too. Then the lights came on and we all went home. It made me wish I had chosen to see "SOMETHINGS GOTTA GIVE AS GOOD AS IT GETS part 2" instead.

To be honest, I am still a little amazed at how much I liked this film. I resisted seeing it for a long time because the concept sounded so offensive. But offensive is the last word I would use to describe this movie. Hilarious would be more accurate. The conjoined twin thing never feels like fodder for cheap jokes. Yes, it plays prominently in the plot, but it just never feels like you are laughing at them, only with them. There is genuine affection for the two main characters, played expertly by Damon and Kinnear, that really shines thru.  To be absolutely honest, a lot of what makes this film so incredible is hard (for me, at least) to describe. All I can say is that it's funny, it's touching, it's a bit of Farrelly brothers magic. See it, you won't regret it.

Walt wants to be a Hollywood actor, Bob can't get the courage up to ask his internet buddy May out - will they both succeed, despite the fact that they're joined at the hip?The Farrelly Brothers are softies at heart - we all know that now - but don't tell me you could tell way back during Dumb and Dumber, or even There's Something About Mary. Mary had a real spicy bite to it, and Dumber was virtually just plain mean-spirited, but lots of laughs for kiddies. Even their 2001 effort Shallow Hal covered a mean-spirited movie with a ridiculous, softy ending.But their latest, Stuck on You is probably the sweetest buddy comedy i've ever seen. It seems to have been a pet project for the Brothers Farrelly for a long time, and i'll bet i can guess why.Its truly remarkable seeing how attached Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear got while playing conjoined twins Bob and Walt. Being stuck together for three months (including sleeping and going to the toilet, off camera) really created something special on celluloid. The choreography of their opening scene, how they work together to make burgers at Bob's burger joint, is incredible. May is played by newcomer Wen Yann Shih, who's stunning to look at, but too self-conscious a performer - all she needs is experience. Eva Mendes, with her ridiculously fake breasts, is the only real cripple in this melodrama. A hopelessly 2-D character.8/10. Resounding applause from me. Mary is probably still their best movie so far, but this would have to be their sweetest.

I went into the cinema with friends and said: "It's a Farrelly Brothers film; you can guess the level of humour." There's Something About Mary I love, but let's face it -- the humour is quite crass, even if the movie does have some heart.

If you can't tell, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.Some gag highlights: Cher with her boyfriends, Matt Damon's stage fright, Greg Kinnear in a animal costume.

I'm actually a big Farrelly Brothers fan (and not just because they're from Rhode Island). So, it's with great reluctance that I write a less than stellar review of "Stuck On You".It's not a horrible film, but like many recent Farrelly releases it's muddled and illustrates a tug of war between the movies the Farrellys want to make the and movies the Farrelly's fans want them to make."Stuck On You" tells the tale of Bob and Walt Tenor, conjoined twins who live a good, peaceful life on Nantucket Island. That is until Walt (played by Greg Kinnear) catches the acting bug and wants to move to LA. The story and gags from there mostly revolve around a fish-out-of-water story (but two fish joined at the side) and the brothers' ongoing ignorance of their own condition.At one point, Bob (played by Matt Damon) tells Walt that he'll never make it in acting. Why? Because he needs a better tan. Though these aren't the idiot gags that we all enjoyed in "Dumb & Dumber". In fact, both of the brothers are very bright. Their ignorance is more a function of their being so close (physically and emotionally) for such a long period of time and because back home everyone accepted them completely. They've become blind to their own handicap.It's a nice message and it is delivered poignantly at times. More often, though, we're hammered with it over and over again while the Farrellys do their best to make the movie look more like one of their more celebrated, more tasteless, and funnier movies like "Dumb & Dumber", "Something About Mary", or "Me, Myself and Irene".In all of the latter movies, there was no illusion that we were there primarily there for the gutter chuckles, but each movie also had characters we really liked. Let's face it. We were all rooting for Lloyd and Harry in "Dumb and Dumber" even if they were morons.In "Stuck On You", the main characters are all a lot flatter than what we've seen before. Plus, one of the most disappointing aspects in "Stuck On You" is the poor use of the minor characters. In previous movies we got some of our biggest laughs from the sideline characters, while in "Stuck On You" they're used mostly as window dressing. Eva Mendes is primarily a cleavage delivery device in "Stuck On You", which is a shame because she's not a bad actress and she could have some comedic chops.How are Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon in this film? They both do as good as can be expected. We're not used to seeing Damon in comedic films (his last was "Dogma"), and I think he does comedy very well. I'm reluctant to comment directly on their performances because it's not fair. The characters are flat and that's not their fault.Sadly, this isn't a fluke for the Farrellys. It's part of an ongoing trend. Their animated movie, "Osmosis Joe", more closely resembled a feature-length public health announcement starring Chris Rock and Bill Murray. "Shallow Hal" dealt with superficiality in much heavier, dramatic tones than we were led to believe in the movie's trailers.*In "Stuck On You", the Farrellys try to swerve back to their poop-and-fart-joke roots, but deep down you can tell they want to make more serious, thematic movies.I would have no problem if the Farrellys decided to do a more serious, dramatic film. I would also have no problem if the Farrellys decided to do more locker-room humor comedies. But I do have a problem with them trying to do both at the same time. It's just not working.* NOTE - While I'm not shopping for the DVD, I did enjoy "Shallow Hal" once I realized (and accepted) that the movie was a lot heavier than the trailers depicted. That said, there were a lot of people in the cinema who were expecting something like "Dumb & Dumber" and they were plenty unhappy about it. I don't blame them.

*** out of ****Well, it had to happen sooner or later. The Farrelly Brothers had to mature (somewhat) at some point and make a film that didn't rely on sex or gross-out jokes. That is apparently the case with Stuck On You, the Farrellys latest and tamest, but it's also one of their sweetest and funniest films to date.Bob and Walt Tenor (Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear) are conjoined twins who've spent their whole lives in Martha's Vineyard. Bob is the owner of a burger restaurant and Walt is an actor who performs plays for the town's audience, but he has bigger ambitions; he wants to be a Hollywood actor, much to the chagrin of Bob, who suffers from a distinct case of stagefright. But after some discussion and compromise, they agree to move to L.A. and start a new life for themselves.Upon arrival, Bob and Walt meet the friendly but ditzy April (Eva Mendes), one of their neighbors in the apartment they've just moved into. Bob even meets his internet pen-pal May (Wen Yann Shih), but because he's never told her he has a conjoined twin, he has to "bring" along Walt on their first date together. As for Walt's Hollywood dreams, after some initial lack of success, he's chosen by Cher herself to co-star with her on her new show, "Honey and the Beaze," in an attempt by Cher to sabotage her own series. But the show is an unexpected success thanks to Walt's burgeoning popularity, which puts a crimp in his relationship with Bob.Reviewing comedies has always been a bit difficult for me, which is why I usually stick to the stuff that I find easier to write about (action/adventure, horror, drama, anything but comedy), but given all the knocks this film has taken (particularly the fact that barely anybody saw it in theaters) I felt a slight sense of obligation to mention that Stuck On You is the funniest and most touching comedy I've seen in recent memory.This is not to say that the film always had me choking with laughter (though a scene involving a guy in front of his typewriter did get the biggest laugh out of me all year), but rather that it consistently delivered smiles, chuckles, and solid laughs without ever bogging down, no easy feat for a movie that runs for just under two hours.Aside from the lack of sexual humor, there's a major difference between the style of comedy the Farrellys employ here than in some of their prior films. Whereas many their previous works have often made fun of the people that suffer from certain "disorders," Stuck On You presents us with two friendly, easy-going guys who've grown accustomed to their situation and choose not to see their conjoined liver as a handicap. Rather, the film derives its humor from the way "outsiders" view their condition.In the film's two lead roles, Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear boast the kind of comic chemistry that most actors can only dream of. Damon, in particular, excels by taking the more "straight man" role, where he's not actually aiming for any laughs but still gets them anyway, maybe even more than the typically hilarious Kinnear. Watching these two guys stuck together reminds me why I find them two of the most likable actors in Hollywood, even when most of Kinnear's characters are generally abrasive losers (but not in this case). It is, in fact, Damon and Kinnear that make the film as wonderfully entertaining as it is. Had not even half of the jokes worked as well as they did, their performances would still warrant this movie a passable recommendation.Stuck On You doesn't always juggle its various subplots perfectly; while Wen Yann Shih does play well into the film, a lot of brief cameos and a wide assortment of characters aren't meshed in as well. Worst of all is Cher, who's neither funny nor particularly convincing as the "bitch" she's made out to be. I have no idea if this says more about her personality or her acting skills.Most of the Farrellys comedies generally tend to dissipate in the last half-hour or so, replacing its humor with more sincere attempts at trying to make their irascible and/or "cad-like" protagonists learn a lesson or two. The magic of Stuck On You is that its protagonists are always the same throughout, making no genuine "it's a miracle!" revelations about themselves at the last minute; after all, brotherly love is still brotherly love.When the last twenty minutes threaten to devolve into sentimental clap-trap, the Farrellys punch in the necessary humor that defuses any of the building sap (spoiler:I think my favorite scene in the whole film is when Bob and Walt re-unite after parting their separate ways, in a scene that's both hilarious and touching), making the film sweet without getting too sweet. The Farrellys have made a lot of funny movies, but this is the first of theirs I can recommend to just about anyone.

I was worried with the 5.6 rating this was going to be average at best but it's so well acted and delivered I can't understand who didn't like it.
It avoids cheap jokes at the expense of the brother's conjoined condition yet delivers laugh after laugh in a good-natured and fun way.
Damon and Kinnear deliver high quality character depth with warmth and charm, well above midnight double feature level and the star cast nods are icing on the cake.
The film is just good fun all the way through. Well worth the time to watch it and it seems it is a somewhat overlooked classy film.

I enjoyed the movie a ton more than I expected to. The Brothers Farrelly have only disappointed me once or twice. I especially like that they have hockey players and other athletes in their movies - Cam Neely in "Dumb and Dumber", Ron Darling in "Shallow Hal" and Brett Favre in "There's Something About Mary". I don't know why I like that, I just do. Also I like the old songs they use - the Cowsills in "Dumb", Edison Lighthouse in "Hal", etc.Anywho, medically speaking, the premise is impossible, therefore stupid, but if you want realism, watch a documentary on the plight of the African fruit fly. Belly laughs are in large supply here. There are some awkward moments or two and I'd have cut some scenes and the movie wouldn't have suffered a bit from a snip here and there.Coming off best is Cher, who I am not a fan of, but given the sense of humor she has to have, I could become one. She practically allows herself to be referred to as a Hollywood has-been, a joke, and a witch. It takes a confident actress to leave herself so exposed, and she goes for it and then some. By playing this part, she's throwing it back in your face and telling you she's not a joke.I enjoyed all the supporting actors too - Meryl Streep (!), Griffin Dunne, Luke Wilson, Frankie Muniz, Jeffrey Ross, Seymour Cassel and of course, Eva Mendez.I wouldn't want the movie implanted in my brain, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it, even though my Mother complained for the first half hour but by the end, thanked me for suggesting we watch it. 7/10.

The Brothers Farrelly without inspiration are just as mediocre as anything else from the Hollywood boredom factory. This picture compares with Shallow Hall in that if one laughs a couple of times, it's a lot. The kind of comedy they work on, needs a lot of crudity and outrageousness. Well, the viewers that dare to pay to see this inane attempt at comedy won't find it here.The best thing going for this movie is Meryl Streep in her brief appearance. Matt Damon and Gregg Kinnear are just wasted. The idea of this odd couple might have sounded very funny when these two were pitching the film, but on the screen it falls flat. The ones that bought the idea might have had too much Pellegrino with lunch, or was it something in the brownies they had for dessert?What are they trying to say? There's no place like home? Togetherness is the best thing that could happen between siblings? It's just an idiotic idea, and judging by the audience reaction at the screening I attended, it will be a miracle if it lasts a couple of weeks when better films will be released.I have an answer to the question "What's a four letter word for snatch?" SUCK (as it's the case of this film)

Parts of this movie had me howling, although I'll warn you beforehand it's not like the other Farrelly bros films "There's Something About Mary" or "Dumb and Dumber". The laughs here are a lot cleaner, less edgy and pretty family friendly for the most part. Overall, the film is much more subtle, which is either good or bad depending on how you like your comedies.The humour here isn't as slapstick & madcap as you might expect from a movie about conjoined twins. Instead it's more subtle, almost like a Christopher Guest film ("Best in Show", "Waiting for Guffman"). For example one of the best gags is the idea that these conjoined twins (by definition, fraternal twins) look nothing alike. Can Matt Damon & Greg Kinnear look any LESS alike? There's currently an 8-page thread in the discussion board where people think it's a loophole, but ya just gotta smack your forehead. The film has a lot of gags like that where no punchline is required; it's just the situational weirdness that makes us laugh, if you're tuned in to it. Another subtle yet funny example is the way Eva Mendes reacts upon learning that the two are conjoined twins. Contrast this with the way Wenn Yan Shih reacts, and you have some comedy gold right there.If you like subtle humour, I think you'll like this film as well as the underratted knee-slappers "Color Me Kubrick" with John Malkovich, the classic "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with Michael Caine & Steve Martin, and a funny Mexican film I saw recently called "Casi Divas". These films may not have you convulsing in laughter, but afterwards I guarantee you'll say to yourself, "Dang that was funny."

This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Unorganized, useless plot, over-done sentimentality, and bad jokes. It was not funny, and the sheer stupidity of it made me want to break down and cry right in the middle of the theater. Its only good quality was-- oh, wait, sorry, there *were* no good qualities. My only thought leaving the theater was, "I am two hours closer to dying."Go see something else while I beg for my money back.

Stuck on You was a pretty funny idea but I just wasn't sure if they would be able to pull it off. Honestly, I wasn't looking forward to seeing this movie at all because I thought it was going to be dumb and full of stupid humor. I was so wrong. Never judge a book by its cover people. They really pulled this film off. I was pleasantly surprised. The jokes and puns were clever and original. I laughed throughout this entire movie.I was amazed at the team work between Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear. They had great chemistry. I can't imagine the amount of practice it took to perfect the coordination to make this movie in one piece.There was a random, unexpected fight scene stuck in there. It was very impressive and unexpected for this type of movie. I really appreciated the contrast in background music as the fight was going on. The moves were very cool and funny but they made the intense fight far less intense which was a good thing because this is supposed to be a light comedy. They were successful at keeping the light feel of the movie even though asses were getting kicked.Matt Damon is an excellent actor. I always realize this when I see him play a variety of roles. He is quite talented. He is often known for his good looks and charm but he is able to play the innocent, cute dork too. I like that about him. He is always able to transform himself into the character he is playing. That is talent.Overall, I really enjoyed this film. I was surprised at how much I liked it. It was quite funny. It was perfect for a quiet night in with a friend and a big bag of popcorn.

Someone said this is the best Farrelly's movie since "There's Something About Mary". Fact is the Farrelly's haven't done much since ".. About Mary" except for "Shallow Hal" which at least had a decent story and good acting. And while "Shallow Hal" won't go down as a classic, it was certainly better than "Stuck On You" - which, quite simply, it shouldn't have been. "Stuck on You" had the POTENTIAL to be an above average comedy, with an original hook (siamese twins) and two excellent actors in Damon and Kinnear. And while there are glimpses of excellent comedy writing, it seems obvious the writer couldn't come up with enough of them to fill out a movie and reverted to standard, cliché'd comedy bits to fill the rest. What a shame. So much promise lost in mediocrity.This movie isn't worth seeing.

Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt (Greg Kinnear) are conjoined twins (joined at their lower trunks--they share a liver) from Massachusetts. They own a burger joint named "Quickie Burger" and Walt has a love of acting. Walt decides to move to California to try his luck at the big time, and although Bob is initially reluctant, he also has a beautiful "Internet pal" in California who he's been talking to for more than three years.Compared to some of directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly's other films, such as Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, and Me, Myself And Irene, we could say that the humor in Stuck On You is much more subtle. That fact may be off-putting to viewers who come to Stuck On You primarily as fans of the Farrelly Brothers' previous work. There are still outrageous gags here, but they tend to be funnier if you exercise your intellect a bit, and believe it or not they are more rooted in reality than some other Farrelly Brothers films. If you are familiar with Daisy and Violet Hilton's story, for example--they were infamous sideshow performers who were conjoined twins--you'll note similarities, such as how they approached relationships with persons of the opposite sex.Like much of the Farrelly Brothers other work, however, Stuck On You is as heartwarming as funny, and on one level, it's primarily a very odd romance film. It also seems that perhaps this is the most personal of their films so far, and it may very well be a depiction of their love for each other as brothers. That also gives Stuck On You a slightly more serious edge, but one that works very well. This is a quality drama in addition to being a comedy leaning towards absurdism. That may sound like a strange combination, but it flowed smoothly for me as a viewer.The performances by Damon and Kinnear are on target, and their love interests, May (Wen Yann Shih) and April (Eva Mendes) are intriguing and not at all clichéd. The extended cameos by Cher and Meryl Streep, as themselves, are very entertaining, and the supporting cast is excellent.

Stuck on You is a light sweet comedy. It takes a while to get going. Usually comedies are based on people insulting each other or being cruel to each other. This one is about conjoined twins who are kind and considerate to each other and to everyone else. It is a wonderful movie to take your kids to. These two are great role models. I have never seen a movie about conjoined twins, so all the gags were fresh for me. There is so much novel comic potential. My jaw dropped a number of times at the acrobatic skill of Greg Kinnear and Matt Matt Damon. I can't see how they could have done it with stunt doubles. They do an eye popping burger making ballet reminiscent of Tom Cruise in Cocktail. They have a fight that would put the Chinese martial artist dance moves to shame. Cher plays herself and spoofs herself. Meryl Street plays herself and spoofs her Mama Mia appearance in a musical Bonnie and Clyde. It was a romp and so much fun. The main plot as based around one of the twins wanting to be an actor while the other finds the idea abhorrent. They find ways to accommodate. It is a beautiful movie because the brothers so enjoy each other and care for the other's welfare. Their good will tends to rub off on everyone they encounter, in unexpected ways.

Since making the comedy of the 1990s in "There's Something About Mary", Bobby and Peter Farrelly have produced gentler fare for themselves and the greater Rhode Island area, sticking in just enough gross-out humor to deflect the "they-got-soft" buzz. But they have been getting softer, and not in a good way. Take "Stuck On You".It's the story of Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt Tenor (Greg Kinnear), conjoined twins remaking their lives when extroverted Walt pursues his acting dreams in Hollywood and introverted Bobby must go along for the ride. Walt finds sudden success while Bobby meets his dream girl, but will their new lives break up this inseparable pair?Acceptance is the overriding message of this film, and it's a nice message for a film that offers little else. At least I know better than to use the term "Siamese twins" now. Damon and Kinnear display nice chemistry, and I chuckled a couple of times.But the Farrellys seem more interested in displaying their humanity than making a funny film. Bob and Walt emote a lot about their hopes and dreams while everyone who ever sold the Farrellys a pizza is wedged into the background as an extra. You can feel them strain to hit the "feel-good" buttons and the punchlines.Alas, someone forgot the hair gel this time. The toothless gags play off the brothers' conjoined situation, but avoid any meanness. Instead it unrealistically tries to play off their situation as no big deal to anyone with half a heart. Like when Walt tells Bob of this hot woman he had drinks with the other night, only "I couldn't get her alone. She had that friend Ruthie with her like a freakin' shadow." They flip burgers and tend goal in a hockey game: "I had 11 saves and Bob had 26".The supporting cast is lackluster, not helped by a script that presents them as backboards for the brothers' banter or the fact that for so many of them, the casting call was the last Farrelly family barbecue. Seymour Cassell as an old agent wears a silly wig, while Cher sends herself up as Walt's unhappy co-star on a TV detective show.I liked isolated scenes, more in the beginning than in the mawkish and excessive second half when the twins cope with sudden success. There's a good scene early on when Walt is scoring with a girl while Bob on the other side of a shower curtain types an e-mail to his pen pal, unfazed by the fact his brother's activity keeps him bouncing up and down. Between positions, Walt tries to sneak a peak at his brother's e-mail. "It's personal," Bob says, pulling it away.That's a nice moment about boundaries, and enough of it shows up now and then for the film to not be a complete drag. You do care about the pair. Damon is good as shy Bob, while Kinnear impresses me, as he did with "Auto Focus", by getting the most out of lame dialogue with a raised eyebrow.Then he has to go and do one of his dead-on Ted Koppell impersonations, reminding you you are really watching a pair of actors strapped to a flesh-tone prosthetic. "Stuck On You" is not a bad idea for a comedy; it's just weakly delivered by a pair of brothers who themselves may have been stuck together too long.

There's something about this `Stuck on You' that sticks to me after my initial impression that the Farrelly Brothers have created another inane comedy to compete with their equally dubious `Dumb and Dumber' franchise, `Shallow Hal, ' and `There's Something about Mary,' among others. That something is taking a story about goofy conjoined twins (Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear), tossing in bathroom and masturbation jokes, and then seeing a basic metaphor about the loss people feel when separated from another human being with whom they have spent their lives.I commend the Farrellys because `Stuck on You' does not play for the broadest laughs but gently lampoons pretentious Hollywood and overtly praises the sincere emotions of two linked humans and the New England town that loves them regardless of their disability.  I liked the connection of two innocent, loving brothers, who miss each other after separation. I liked botoxed Cher's presence to emphasize the decayed humanity of L.A., which sees clearly the business profit in deformity.On another allegorical level, the twins could be the projection of the Farrellys themselves, going to Hollywood to exploit its penchant for seizing on the flavor of the month, regardless of its incorrectness or inhumanity and facing their own eventual split (Bobby is considering cutting back on their productions). The Farrellys are not the Coens, whose satire is more Kaufmans' `Adaptation' (Even if the brother is only imagined) than Zuckers' `Airplane.' But the Farrellys' five major motion pictures make them as bankable as any other successful brothers in the business.Seeing diva Cher make fun of herself and Meryl Streep cutup as co-star with Kinnear in a musical stage production of `Bonnie and Clyde'(Think `Springtime for Hitler') are a couple of reasons to see this film.  The best reason, however, is to enjoy the lighthearted interaction of two brothers who learn that nature's cruel marriage of their bodies gave them the best emotional marriage of their lives.  The Farrellys have confirmed the Karl Menninger belief that `to know one another well enough should not be to hate one another the more but to love one another the more.'Even those of us not conjoined could learn about brotherly  love from `Stuck on You.'

A great comedy, with a great script, wholesome message and a new, original story. Nuff said.

O.K. lets start with the word hilarious. Can I say hilarious? Well, I just did. This movie was damned funny. The Farrely brothers do it again. They definitely have this comedy thing licked."Stuck on You" was a nice meld of physical comedy and scripted comedy. And this was one of those movies that could not have been funny without absurd scenarios such as the completely ignoring of the other half by dates or other people when it called for it. This was one of the Farrely bros. cleaner comedies and it still maintained a funny edge. Also, after watching this movie, you look up and realize that there is a fairly touching story to it as well. Sign me up for the next Farrely Brothers production.

Different types of comedy is always good. There should always be gross-out, satire, farce, and subtle comedy available. However, Stuck on You, the newest offering by the Farrelly Brothers, is none of those, for it tries to be offensive without being too offensive, because then some people would be offended. It seems here like the Farrellys, who are known for their bad taste, wanted to make fun of conjoined twins, but felt like it may upset some people, so instead they cast them in a loving light, but don't know what to do with it. Nice comedy does not work for the Farrellys.Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt (Greg Kinnear) have been stuck together for all of their lives. They have simple lives owning and being short-order cooks at the Quickee Burger. Walt is an aspiring actor and dreams of being an actor in Hollywood. Bob agrees to go with him (obviously) to Hollywood, because Bob's internet friend May (Wen Yann Shih) lives there, also. Almost immediately, Cher gives Walt a job, but their relationship is soon tested as they continue to live in L.A.As I said earlier, the Farrellys don't know what to do with all of their material that isn't offensive, and since the essence of them is in their ability to offend people, they don't have anything up their sleeves to show us. They could have gone deeper into the relationship between Bob and Walt, but they barely go into that, and when they do, it isn't funny (except for the `We're Off to See the Wizard' thing). Humor is subjective, but I think most agree with me in that most of the movie wasn't funny.Being the movie geek that I am, I eat up anything related to Hollywood, so I was excited for when Bob and Walt were going there, hoping to hear some good Hollywood jokes. Unfortunately, about the most of it is Cher yelling at someone. If that makes you laugh, then more power to you, but I think most people require more. I will admit, though, that Cher's new boyfriend did make me laugh. For the most part, once the scene changes, the laughs don't.The effect to make Damon and Kinnear look conjoined looked so fake it looked real. It just looked like some skin attached between the two, and oftentimes it looked like it moved around some. Also, how did they get separate clothes on? It's a small detail, but it bothered me. Back to the Farrellys for a minute, more jokes could have been made not at the expense of conjoined twins but just with them, something like in Airplane 2: The Sequel.I don't understand why everyone makes fun of Damon's acting, he's a solid actor, and he wasn't half bad here, but Kinnear was his better half. The two played off each well, and, amazingly enough, Mendes wasn't too bad either, but it seemed like everything Shih tried to do was fake. Overall, if you do see Stuck on You, don't.<BR><BR>My rating: 4/10Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, and some language.

Peter and Bobby Farrelly, known collectively as the Farrelly brothers, took the comedy world by surprise in 1994, with a small but explosive comedy about a duo of very, very stupid friends: "Dumb and Dumber". Now regarded as one of the best and most influential comedies of the 90s, the movie became an instant hit and put the Farrelly brothers in the map. More than a decade after their successful debut, the Farrelly brothers have kept improving their well-known style of light hearted slapstick comedy, although the toilet humor they used frequently in their earlier movies has become a subtler (although no less outrageous) kind of comedy. "Stuck on You" follows this progression where toilet humor is replaced by some touches of charming drama in the story of a couple of sibling who just happen to be a bit too close from each other.Bob (Matt Damon) and Walt (Greg Kinnear), a couple of co-jointed twins living Martha's Vineyard where they have a small yet very successful fast food restaurant. While their condition is problematic at times, since they were kids the brothers made themselves the promise to never limit each other, so they have lived their lives to the max. However, Walt has an ambition: to be a Hollywood movie star. Bob knows Walt has the talent, but unlike him, he is more of a small town man, preferring the comfort of his town to the urban environment of L.A., but he has his own reasons to visit Hollywood, as his best friend May (Wen Yann Shih), whom he has met only via Internet, lives there and this may be his only chance to meet the love of his life.The Farrelly brothers, along with regular collaborators Charles B. Wessler and Bennett Yellin, have crafted a delightful script about the brother's relationship that respectfully deals with the twins' handicap, pretty much in the same way as "Shallow Hal" presented obesity. While their condition is certainly the film's main plot device, it is very important to point out that the source of the jokes is not the brother's handicap itself, but the people's reactions to them, and more importantly, the way they deal with their problems. Unlike most of the Farrelly's earlier movies, the film is very realistic, and never really offensive or exploitative in some way. The script is actually very funny, and with very well constructed characters (the twins' relationship may have been inspired by the directors' own relationship); it is this quality what makes "Stuck on You" to stand out, as the characters are so easy to sympathize with that it's hard to not like them.As directors, the brothers stay close to their successful formula of highly energetic slapstick, but as written above, the addition of drama to the story gives it a lot more heart than their previous offerings. The fact that, like "Shallow Hal", this comedy is a more character driven story, allows the brothers to showcase their progress as directors of actors and to prove that they is definitely more in their bag of tricks than an assortment of gross out jokes. In fact, the movie shows even less toilet humor than "Shallow Hal", and shows a couple of comedy directors than have finally reached the maturity of their craft. This is not to say that the movie lacks slapstick comedy, as the twins' handicap is often put to test to overcome the many obstacles of their life in Hollywood. However, as I said before, this done in more a championing and positive way than in humiliating or disrespectful way.Given that the film is entirely focus on the brothers, the actors portraying them have to not only be able to carry the film, they must completely work together as a team to pull off the roles believably. Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon are at first sight an unlikely pair for this kind of comedy, but surprisingly both manage to deliver a delightful performance as the brothers. With an amazing coordination and great talent for comedy, both actors manage to deliver realistic and very touching performances. It's safe to say that Damon is the weakest of the two, but that has more to do with Kinnear's remarkable scene stealing delivery than with any lack of talent in Damon's side. Eva Mendes is really the film's surprise by making a charming performance as April, the brother's enthusiastic neighbor in Hollywood who quickly becomes their best friend during their time in California.Certainly most fans will miss the gross out toilet humor of the earlier films, but the way the Farrelly brothers manage the subtle mix of comedy and drama of the film is more than enough to make up for that missing element. Often criticized for being exploitative of people's handicaps, with this movie the brothers prove that all that criticism was simply a misunderstanding of the siblings' comedy, as "Stuck on You" is anything but exploitative, and instead offers good insight about the problems that co-jointed twins' (or any other handicapped person for that matter) face when trying yo "fit" in the supposedly "normal society". This is certainly the film with most heart the brothers have ever done, and certainly one of their best. While one can certainly miss the freshness and irreverence of their earlier films, it's safe to say that by following this path the brothers soon will be delivering masterpieces of comedy."Stuck on You" was a big surprise for me, as probably like many people, I was expecting bad taste jokes and highly offensive exploitation. It was very refreshing to see that "Stuck on You" was very different than what I was expecting and turned out to be one of the most charming comedies the brothers have directed. With an excellent cast and most of all, a witty and intelligent script, this movie can proudly rank as one of the best comedies of the first decade of the 21st century. 7/10

You know those movies you see that the minute you get out, you phone all of your friends to tell them to save their money? Yeah, I did that about 30 seconds afterdeparting the AMC today. What a dog. All the amusing parts weren't even funny if you're a regular movie goer, because they funny parts were in the trailer I'd seen countless times already. (I see far too many movies, okay?)The movie had a few good moments though, like wher the end credits rolled and I knew I could leave. Aside from some nice cleavage from supporting actresses, this movie is a crime. Save your money for the ABC special in two years on conjoined crappy movies.

Maybe you saw "Me, Myself and Irene" and "Shallow Hal" and thought that the Farrelly brothers might be losing their comedic mojo. Maybe you heard that they were now making a movie about siamese twins and thought it was a terrible idea. Maybe you saw the trailer and still thought it wouldn't be any good.Well, all those statements applied to me, and I'm telling you to forget it all, because "Stuck On You" is easily the Farrelly brothers' best film since the classic "There's Something About Mary".Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear play Bob and Walt Tenor, conjoined ("siamese") twins living in Martha's Vineyard, and are popular and well-liked there. Especially Walt, who is quite the ladies man (Bob is kind of a dork).
Walt has big dreams and convinces Bob to go with him to Hollywood to becom e an actor, where he lands a leading role on a hilariously awful "C.S.I." rip-off show called "Honey and the Beaze" with Cher (that's right, Cher), who plays herself."Stuck On You" is a genuine surprise. It's one of those movies where you realize in the very first scene that it's going to be a lot better than you thought it would be. The Farrelly brothers' mixture of endearingly oddball characters, funny dialogue and an easygoing folk/rock soundtrack work as well here as they did in "...Mary" and the very underrated "Kingpin".
The actors playing the twins are an excellent match, and Kinnear is good, but Damon is even better. I am continually amazed at his ability to play any kind of character, whether it's an action hero like in "The Bourne Identity" or a complete dweeb like in "Stuck On You" (and anything in between) and do it convincingly.Cher is also quite a good sport to play herself as such a mean prima donna for most of the movie.I also really like the way the Farrelly brothers like to include handicapped people in small roles of their films without any hint of being pretentious or pious about it. Most notable in this film is Ray "Rocket" Valliere, a mentally handicapped man who gives one of the most likeable performances in the movie."Stuck On You" isn't perfect (the middle section is a bit dry), but for the most part it's a very entertaining, very funny, and yes, even touching film that is never less that fun to watch. In addition to all that there are a bunch of cool uncredited cameos and a GREAT final scene that provides pretty much the exact emotional punch you need it to.And be sure to sit through the credits. You won't regret it.

I quite like most of the Farrelly Brothers movies, (There's something about Mary & Dumb and Dumber) are both brilliant (Shallow Hal and Kingpin) were pretty good, but Stuck on you is definitely stuck in the middle of two genres, and satisfies neither of them very well.Yes it is a Comedy, but not a particularly funny one, it's also a Drama, that's too shallow to be Dramatic. I can see what the Farrelly brothers wanted to achieve but, for me at least, they missed.Don't discard this movie, just don't expect a typical Farrelly brothers movie, cause this isn't one, probably worth a look if you stuck on something to do. Sorry, couldn't resist.5/10

To be honest, I am still a little amazed at how much I liked this film. I resisted seeing it for a long time because the concept sounded so offensive. But offensive is the last word I would use to describe this movie. Hilarious would be more accurate. The conjoined twin thing never feels like fodder for cheap jokes. Yes, it plays prominently in the plot, but it just never feels like you are laughing at them, only with them. There is genuine affection for the two main characters, played expertly by Damon and Kinnear, that really shines thru.  To be absolutely honest, a lot of what makes this film so incredible is hard (for me, at least) to describe. All I can say is that it's funny, it's touching, it's a bit of Farrelly brothers magic. See it, you won't regret it.

Walt wants to be a Hollywood actor, Bob can't get the courage up to ask his internet buddy May out - will they both succeed, despite the fact that they're joined at the hip?The Farrelly Brothers are softies at heart - we all know that now - but don't tell me you could tell way back during Dumb and Dumber, or even There's Something About Mary. Mary had a real spicy bite to it, and Dumber was virtually just plain mean-spirited, but lots of laughs for kiddies. Even their 2001 effort Shallow Hal covered a mean-spirited movie with a ridiculous, softy ending.But their latest, Stuck on You is probably the sweetest buddy comedy i've ever seen. It seems to have been a pet project for the Brothers Farrelly for a long time, and i'll bet i can guess why.Its truly remarkable seeing how attached Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear got while playing conjoined twins Bob and Walt. Being stuck together for three months (including sleeping and going to the toilet, off camera) really created something special on celluloid. The choreography of their opening scene, how they work together to make burgers at Bob's burger joint, is incredible. May is played by newcomer Wen Yann Shih, who's stunning to look at, but too self-conscious a performer - all she needs is experience. Eva Mendes, with her ridiculously fake breasts, is the only real cripple in this melodrama. A hopelessly 2-D character.8/10. Resounding applause from me. Mary is probably still their best movie so far, but this would have to be their sweetest.

This one's not really there, is it......it is only just sorta funny and more ridiculous in a clumsy way that ridiculous in an actual funny way. Personally, KINGPIN is an absolute scream from start to finish, IRENE is uproarious, MARY is hilarious, DUMB AND DUMBER is exactly that. SHALLOW HAL, I managed to miss. Me thinks the Farrelly's are spreading their fluids too thin and are in need of a creativity enema. However, I assume the accountants are begging for more and we will see this cycle of films fizzle like a Zucker. I just sat there through this one, hurrumphing occasionally and marvelling that Cher could move her mouth. Most of the audience were rustling and gargling occasionally too. Then the lights came on and we all went home. It made me wish I had chosen to see "SOMETHINGS GOTTA GIVE AS GOOD AS IT GETS part 2" instead.
