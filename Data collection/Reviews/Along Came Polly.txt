It's a romantic comedy with Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston in the main roles. The plot is very funny and even not being totally innovative it has some different characteristics from some other romantic comedies. I enjoyed the ending of this movie, something that I usually don't in romantic comedies, and that was because of even being predictable the ending was funny! The Anniston's character is just great. She's funny, nonsensical, but at the same time very independent and sweet. The character played by Stiller is the typical guy who wants a compromise, to be married and have kids; but he will change with her. To the point that near the end he just says: "I don't want to get married. I just want to take you to dinner, sometime this week".I liked the plot, the jokes, the characters, and found it a very entertaining and some kind of different romantic comedy!

The story's not overly engaging, but for some reason Along Came Polly is fun. Ben Stiller just has that knack of being able to embarass himself and we love him for it. You can't help but laugh. But the film is worth a look for Philip Seymour Hoffman, too, as the child actor still looking for recognition -- and work. The basketball court scene is great, but the best is his performance with a community theatre's production of Jesus Christ Superstar. If you've ever been in community theatre, or you've hung out with actors, you'll appreciate this.

I thought this was about a silly romance, so I didn't see it when it first came out. I rented the DVD and I liked it so much I watched it again with my daughter two nights later. I should have known Ben Stiller wouldn't do a totally "straight" movie, but the comedy wasn't so over the top either. It was a perfect blend of comedy and sincerity. One of the stand-out performances came from Hank Azaria. His portrayal of the French scuba instructor, Claude, was a scene-stealer. One of the funniest characters I've seen in a long time. I recommend this as a perfect date movie, or if you're just sitting at home and want to LOL! Be sure to check out the gag reel.

ALONG CAME POLLY (2004) *** Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Debra Messing, Bryan Brown, Hank Azaria, Michele Lee, Bob Dishy, Alec Baldwin, Missi Pyle. Stiller gives another of his patented hapless schmuck romantics turns as newlywed risk management assessor whose marriage is on the rocks when his wife (Messing) has an affair on their honeymoon, sending him back to NYC to assess his life and runs into former junior high friend Aniston who knocks him for a loop despite her flaky demeanor. Frequently funny and evenly paced by writer and first-time director John Hamburg the laughs come often and no thanks to Hoffman as Stiller's sloven has-been actor buddy and Baldwin as his vulgar boss. Despite the toilet humor (surprisingly in somewhat good taste if you can call it that) the film does have a heart and Stiller and Aniston make for a cute couple.

I watched this movie first in the theater back in 2004 and I remember I had a good time. On a second time view, I can say I had a better time.The movie is about a marriage that fails miserably when the recently weds go on their honeymoon. Everything seems just fine until the wife decides to cheat on the husband and that's when things really start to get difficult.The husband, Ben Stiller, has an encounter with an ex-high school friend, the pretty Polly (Aniston) and since then they start dating and trying to make it work although they're very different on every aspect. Stiller is an obsessive compulsive man that can't do wrong on his job, life, and everything else. Polly is a woman that takes life on the light side and doesn't cares about much... anything.They're opposite poles but that makes things work for them. The problem is when Stiller's ex-wife returns looking for him.Then you have a comedic-problematic situation that would be enough to keep you entertained.There are many funny situations that kind of reminded of the popular sitcom "Friends": For example, Stiller decides to write on a computer all about Polly. Her attributes, flaws, and expectations. The same happened on a "Friends" episode where Ross does the same to Rachel (Aniston). And the ending is similar to the episode...So this may sound like a "Friends" spin-off but the movie has unique humor and situations that separate it from any other comedies.Give it a try and you'll be entertained. The best scenes in the movie in my opinion are the "salsa" dance sequences, the final argument with the insurance company, and the whole situation with Aniston's pet.Jennifer Aniston is simply charming, sexy, and funny. Not "funny" like in her "Friends" character. This time she chose the right character and she demonstrates she's a talented actress on the comedy field. Not to mention she looks really, really hot.Ben Stiller is funny as always but he's been typecast. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a great actor and in this movie he can only demonstrate a few comedic skills but that's enough to show he's great.Hank Azaria is an unique talent and he is just hilarious. The same for Alec Baldwin who is an unconventional comedian but every time he demonstrates he's a quality actor. Debra Messing just looks sexy and does nothing much.

Once again, Ben Stiller gives us yet another comedy, about love, life and being an adult nerd. Yet, this sadly doesn't hold a candle to 'Something About Mary', which may have been his best movie of his career.We begin the film, seeing Reuben (Stiller) marrying Lisa (Messing). After their reception they head to St. Bartes, for their honeymoon. While on the beach they meet a French scuba instructor who has offered to take them out on his boat. Rebuen declines because he has a nervous stomach, but he insists that his beautiful new bride go, to make her happy. When he returns later that day to the boat, he finds his wife cheating on him. Upset, and hurt, he flies home, depressed that he has not only lost his wife, but now has decisions to deal with because of hers.Enter Polly. Several days after he returns to New York, his friend takes him to a party where he runs into a waitress (Aniston), whom he went to school with when he was in junior high. He calls her the next day and asks her out. Throughout the rest of the film, he learns how to deal with his phobias, irritations and just how to cut loose.Each time I see this film, it somehow has the opposite effect on me as most, where as normally I grow to love the film more and more, each time I see it, this one actually, seems to get worse and worse with each viewing. It is funny, and it's not a bad film at all, it's clever and cute, it's just that it does tend to lose flavor each time you see it.Aniston and Stiller were equally good in this, and I still recommend it. It's a light comedy, and not at all like, 'The Cable Guy' or 'There's Something About Mary'. So, if you're looking for films that were as dark or adult as those, you won't find it here. But, it still is cute and clever in its own way, so it might still be worth a watch. Plus, Alec Baldwin plays a small part, which is not to be missed.

Ben Stiller is known for wacky characters such as White Goodman from Dodgeball, Tony Perkis in Heavy Weights, and the male model known as Derek Zoolander in Zoolander. But his other roles have been the quiet yet hysterical characters like Gaylord 'Greg' Focker in Meet the Parents and Meet the Focker's. This type of character is perfect for Stiller.In Along Came Polly, Stiller stars as Reuben Feffer, the neurotic, slightly OCD risk-insurance salesman who looks at the outcome of a situation before getting involved. He decides whether or not a person is too much of a liability. Recently married to Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing), who on their honeymoon, decides to "get it on" with the scuba instructor (Hank Azaria). Fleeing back to the states, he meets up with his long time friend Sandy Lyle (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He was a star actor but now is a has been who tries to go back to the top. For starters, he will be headlining the community theater production of Jesus Christ Superstar...as Judas.Now that Reuben is back, he is "free", but isn't ready for a relationship. Since he is still actually married, he decides to just lay low, until he meets an old friend from junior high. Enter Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), the free spirited, total opposite of Reuben who will flip his world upside down. Even though they seem to be on the opposite sides of the love spectrum, Reuben is crazy for her...hesitant...but still into it.What makes this movie work is the combination of wacky humor and romance. Hoffman is hysterical as Lyle who thinks he is the cats meow. With his life being filmed for a feature on his life, Lyle is confident and even tries to be Reuben's mentor. Although they don't see eye to eye with certain issues, the two have a sort of brotherly bond that lasts thru thick and thin. Aniston is great as Polly and with the addition of Stiller, the two become a great duo, feeding off of each other's energy.This movie is a great date flick and is even a good film to just pop in once and a while. Ben Stiller is on a roll with making movies these days and this is no exception. Along Came Polly is fantastic and worth watching. Another triumph for Stiller...and as Sandy Lyle once said, "Let it rain!"

It starts off slowly because you need to be set up for the story line. Once it picks up, it becomes side splitting.Here is a movie that is difficult to predict where it is going to go but oh what a ride as it gets there. I may be the only person in the world who didn't think something about Mary (sorry--keyboard is broken and won't capitalize consistently) wasn't funny so I thought this movie was much better done, especially with the toilet humor.Excellent performance by Hank azaria (I didn't recognize him).a good movie to watch when it's too nasty to go outside. I wouldn't recommend eating popcorn while watching it because you may choke because you're laughing so hard.

Ben and Jen do their best to overcome an unengaging story and a lack of forward momentum in Along Came Polly. There are some decent laughs throughout, but nothing that stuck with me after the credits. It's not awful by any means, but it's pretty forgettable.

This was a pleasant enough movie. It would have been released when Aniston was in her final year of "Friends". A pleasure of this is that she holds her own against Ben Stiller.Hank Azaria is always a laugh! First, he was a boyfriend with Phoebe on "Friends", and this time he did a terrific job with the accent! He has a couple moments in this movie where I laughed myself into tears! I never discovered this film until it was almost four years old, and I wonder why I never saw it before. You will not be disappointed as a fan of Stiller and Aniston.Great stuff!

Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston lead a talented cast and for the most part deliver the laughs. Reuben Feffer {Ben Stiller} is looking for a new relationship after walking in on his wife {Debra Messing} with a scuba diving instructor {Hank Azaria}. While at a party he sees Polly {Jennifer Aniston} this girl he used to go to school with, they start dating and Reuben is trying to act more loose for Polly since Polly is very loose. The plot is very similar to There's Something About Mary and it even steals from an episode of Friends. The film is not very original so that's one strike against it lucky for the film it has a funny cast. What really makes this movie work is Philip Seymour Hoffman, he is hilarious as Sandy and he is the best part about this movie. The rest of the supporting cast is funny including Hank Azaria as the scuba instructor and Alex Baldwin as Reuben's boss. Ben Stiller is funny but its getting tiring to see him in the same role. Jennifer Aniston pretty much plays her Rachel character and she's enjoyable. The problem though is that Ben and Jen don't make a realistic couple. We have also seen it all before so there's no reason to rush out and see this film. Rating 7/10, a funny movie that's worth a look

I heard this movie was a hard sell, which is probably why I ended up enjoying it so thoroughly. The movie is far from perfect  the talented cast is somewhat misdirected - but it's their talent, along with the hilarious circumstances that unfold throughout the film's neat 90 min running time, which keeps the film moving and the laughter rolling. Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston strike a nice contrast as the fated couple united by a hysterical comedy of errors. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as Stiller's pitiful (and only) friend and confidant. And Alec Baldwin steals every scene in which he appears (would love to see him do more comedy).I am not easily offended by bathroom humor  quite the opposite, I think it's funny when pulled off right. Whenever I read viewers complaining about so-called 'gross-out humor' or "toilet bowl comedy", I am genuinely confused. When the hell did we get so uptight? Fart jokes and bedroom humor have comprised some of the funniest scenes ever filmed (Jeff Daniels in "Dumb & Dumber" or "Chris Tucker" in Friday, for example). I'd recommend this harmless and enjoyable movie to my mother (toilet humor, and all!).

Ben Stiller is a fine actor, and a good comedic one. He has always been recognized because of his comedic roles. But there's a time, when we always seem to be watching the same thing. We say: "I've seen this before, it's familiar". It will be more familiar, when the writer and director of this movie is John Hamburg; who wrote two of Stiller's comedies in the past few years ("Meet the Parents", "Zoolander"). This guy is very funny, really. But he should think about putting some freshness in his material from now on. This is why we can't enjoy Ben Stiller as we usually do, and that's a shame.Jokes. There's another animal, here, too. It's a ferret, and it's blind. Some little jokes occur when it crashes anything, because it can't see. Remember animals? The cat, in "Meet the parents" (or the dog in "There's something about Mary", another Stiller comedy). The whole thing, about the man loosing it, and replacing it for another one that destroys everything. And the jokes with the cat in the bathroom. The bathroom is always present. We sense the farts, when Polly and Reuben are eating. Then, when they both arrive at Polly's house, he says he needs to use the bathroom. We hear the farts. And the only reason why we don't hear them louder, it's because it would be just as any other film, with this scene in it. The louder sound it's replaced with some cleaning jokes. And in the "salsa" club, when Reuben dances. It could have been a very funny scene, but Stiller looks a lot as his character in "Zoolander", dancing, with his faces. A shame, again.The romance is quite familiar, we know. We sense (again) what will happen when Javi (a gay person who dances salsa; "Hector plays the keyboards...") tells Reuben that Polly is leaving town. We are about to see the "I'll catch her before she leaves" scene. And Reuben runs, as usual, but she has already left, although she returns five minutes later.Talking about she, Polly is an interesting character after all. And Jennifer Aniston plays it in a very nice way. She (Aniston) is a good comedic actress. She played comedy for years ("Friends"), and played some nice characters in "Picture Perfecr" and in "Bruce Almighty". She continues to grow.The rest of the cast is all-star. They're all funny. And of course, there's also the best character in the film and the best performance, given by the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He makes Sandy so disgusting and so charming at the same time. Seriously, he steals the film. He brings the freshness to the movie and has the funniest moments, you'll see.To watch Ben Stiller, you should check out the previously mentioned "Something About Mary" and "Meet the Parents" (not "Zoolander"), or maybe "Mystery Men", which is interesting.I laughed.

The film belongs to the demential genre, it's a comedy like "There's something about Mary" -actually there's the same actor, and the same screenwriter of recent Ben Stiller movies as well.We laugh sometimes, but (as it often happens) we see that the most comical moments were in the trailer! Ben Stiller always does the same character -the Jewish young man, awkward and jinxed-, with a beauty to court (this time is Jennifer Aniston).Everything here is predictable, nothing surprises us. The film wants to be politically incorrect as well, but many lines and situations are really vulgar. A bad film you can easily forget.

Add me to the list of folks who saw this film under duress, since some friends were going and I decided to tag along just to see them.  I was pleasantly surprised at this film, since I'm no big Stiller fan and can take or leave Aniston (having just seen one of her previous rom-coms Picture Perfect).It's a by-the-numbers, perfectly acceptable opposites-attract rom-com, with an unfortunate overlay of gross-out humor that seems to have been added by someone along the way to change the tone of the film.  But this gross-out stuff is loaded towards the start, so once it's out of the way the two stars can get back to business - which is pushing and pulling each other until Stiller can "see the light."  Interesting how there's no attempt to show that Aniston's character has to or is interested in changing, it all comes from Stiller's character, who frankly is in a fine position in his life and really doesn't need the "wildness" that Aniston is supposed to represent.I was impressed by how they handle the wandering-wife-comes-back storyline, she presents herself quite humbly and asks for forgiveness and frankly he would have been better off going to counseling with her and getting on with his life in suburbia.  But hey, everyone knows (in movies, anyway) that you're supposed to spend your life with the person who's least like you. Har de har har, good luck to that!

While in his honeymoon in a paradisaical beach, the conservative risk analyst of an insurance company Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) finds his wife Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing) having intercourse with her scuba instructor Claude (Hank Azaria) in his boat. The cuckold Reuben immediately returns to New York and his friend Sandy Lyle (Philip Seymour Hoffman) invites him to go to a party. There he meets his former high school friend Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), who is a very independent woman that lives in the edge with her blind ferret in a cozy but simple apartment. Although having very different behaviors, they date and fell a great attraction for each other. When Lisa returns, Reuben has to decide if he wants to live his life in the suburb with his unfaithful wife, or have a risky relationship with Polly."Along Came Polly" is a good entertainment, where the beauty of Jennifer Aniston shines. The story is funny, and I was almost hypnotized with the cute Jennifer Aniston, who is also a great comedian. I also can understand the reaction of Reuben with Polly, since she is "too much sand for the truck of Ben Stiller". There is an interesting discussion in the Message Boards about the hypothesis of Jack Black performing the role of Sandy. I like Philip Seymour Hoffman very much, he has a good performance in this film, but indeed the character of Sandy Lyle seems to be tailored for Jack Black. Good perception of this user. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Quero Ficar Com Polly" ("I Want to Stay With Polly")Obs.: On 28 December 2008, I watched this funny comedy again.

Along Came Polly (2004)Along Came Polly is not Ben Stiller's best film nor his best performance but I really enjoyed it. It's not that original but it is still somehow fresh. It is pretty well written and there are plenty of memorable and distinct moments that make it more recognizable and original than the storyline itself would make it seem like it would. The bathroom scene, the ferret and the basketball scene are a few of these moments. As far as acting goes, Ben Stiller does what he usually does. He makes you laugh and believe his character but doesn't actually act wonderfully, which doesn't seem to make sense. His performance is similar to that in There's Something About Mary. Jennifer Aniston also gives the same performance as almost everything she's done, which isn't good but it works out fine all together. The best character and performance in the film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He has a very strange role in comparison to most of his other work, and he does it great. He was very hilarious and did really good, he kept the film more watchable, though he had a small role. Hank Azaria also had a very funny yet even smaller role that added more character to the otherwise average film. Any fan of Ben Stiller or Jennifer Aniston will most likely enjoy Along Came Polly. It's nothing extremely special and it's not the funniest movie, but it has a good story and has many good laughs. Definitely worth watching if it's on TV or something, but not really something you need to run out and rent, unless, like I said, you are a big fan of Stiller or Aniston. 7/10

A comedy about a man named Reuben Feffer(Ben Stiller)meets a woman named Polly Prince(Jennifer Aniston) they are total opposites Polly lives life on the wild side and Reuben lives life on the safe side but as they say opposites attract.Ben Stiller gives a excellent performance as usual.Jennifer Aniston also gives a very good performance.This movie is full of hilarious characters such as his best friend sandy Lyle(Philip Seymour Hoffman),the scuba instructor,Reuben's boss,and a few others.The screenplay was very funny.All around the actors all do a great job especially Sandy Lyle(Philip Seymour Hoffman).The storyline was not lacking anything it was absolutely perfect.The directing was not extremely special but it was not entirely bad either.Best actor/actress-(Philip Seymour Hoffman) A movie full of fun- Jake Hyden I rated this 7 out of 10 Rated-(PG-13) for sexual content,language,crude humor and some drug references.7/10

Over the years of all the comedies I've saw this one "Along Came Polly" has to be one of the better ones, and it's probably one of the better films of 2004. It's filled with plenty of laughs, humor, and the search and trying of finding a new love from an old friend is nice and neat. Funny guy Ben Stiller plays Reuben Feffer a hard working insurance adjuster who's just recently married his elegant and attractive sweetheart Lisa(Debra Messing)and upon their honeymoon Reuben finds out that he's been cheated on right away! So now that all seems lost it's back to his job with gruff and tough boss Stan(Alec Baldwin)then one day when his washed up actor turned Broadway star friend Snady(Philip Seymour Hoffman) introduces him to an old friend at a party a renewed spirit is introduced! Upon meeting Polly Prince(Jennifer Aniston) who's an old high school friend who's back in town after moving around from many jobs she's now trying her go at being a party and cocktail waitress. And the old saying is true opposites attract as both attitudes are different with Reuben being nervous and neurotic and very cautious of the world while Polly is a liberal and a very free spirited person. Yet as both get to know each other it proves opposites attract and love and happiness is possible! Overall this is a nice and cute little comedy made watchable by Ben and Jen.

Along Came Polly is a comedy featuring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, as two former high school classmates, who begin a new romance after a chance meeting years later.There are several scenes that I got a good laugh out of, like the overflowing toilet bit and the basketball er how shall I say, "mishap". Hank Azaria was also pretty funny as the Francophone scuba diver (too bad he gets such limited screen time). Oh yes, and the accident prone ferret is also a cute recurring joke.But overall the film misses more that it hits. It never really settles on much of a direction until the predictable conclusion. It just meanders from one location to the next, with an occasional sight gag thrown in for good measure (only 2 or 3 of which are really that funny). Ben and Jen's characters have no believable chemistry. Philip Seymor Hoffman's former child actor character is annoying and feels forced (look at me I'm trying to be wacky and unconventional, give me some attention already!). The subplot of some wealthy thrill seeker trying to get approved for insurance, or whatever, is just pointless and really adds nothing to the main plot or provides any laughs.We also have Stiller playing essentially the same role he's been playing for the bulk of his career, a naïve guy who gets more than he bargained for after starting a new relationship. ACP offers us nothing that Stiller and crew haven't done before and to better effect in films like "Flirting with Disaster", "There's Something About Mary", and "Meet the Parents".All said and done you have another average, flavor of the month comedy, among a sea of countless others like it. Worth catching on TBS if you want something light to kill 90 minutes, otherwise I wouldn't bother.

Blind ferrets, IBS, base-jumping ... "Along Came Polly" is one of those situational humor comedies that takes a basic romantic comedy plot and surrounds it with the bizarre whether it's ridiculous situations or zany characters. Creator John Hamburg takes two likely comedy protagonists -- a risk-assessing neurotic type (Ben Stiller) and the free-spirited unpredictable type (Jennifer Aniston) who come together after Stiller's character's wife cheats on their honeymoon -- and puts them in outrageous situations and dealing with strange characters to amp up the humor. It's hit or miss, but the creative thought behind it keeps it laudable and interesting.These are two characters that Stiller and Aniston have proved more than capable of playing. As their unlikely relationship unfolds, it's more about how they handle the more extreme characters and situations. Philip Seymour Hoffman, for example, is Stiller's best friend is an "actor" who still tries to pretend as if a movie he did years ago gives him an excuse to be arrogant. Hank Azaria plays a french nudist scuba instructor as only he -- master of accents -- can. Alec Baldwin even plays the unethical, awkwardly buddy-buddy boss of Stiller's character. It's not so much Stiller's ability to do comedy as it is for him to react to these actors doing great character work.The situational comedy is also incredibly diverse and wildly unpredictable: whether it's the first date where Stiller's IBS kicks in after eating spicy food and he can't discretely use the restroom or the scene when he and Aniston get in a fight while on a sailboat plunging through a storm so that the entire scene they're getting thrown around the set. Nothing is that incredibly funny, but it's all about unique situations that you haven't seen in movies before that amuse you as you follow the story."Polly" is not refreshing or innovative, but it's creative takes using traditional comedy techniques and its killer supporting cast keep it very entertaining. You don't really care if Stiller and Aniston stay together in the end, you're more interested in what the other characters are going to say/do/influence them along the way.

Cliche is the only word that springs to mind with this film. Throughout practically every part of the film, I was saying to myself "I've seen this dozens of times before." A very standard formula, which is funny in places, but is too predicable to properly enjoy.

I am surprised at the comments that I have read so far that suggest this is a boring or mediocre movie.  All that I know is that I am a 46 year old married mother, and I just spent 90 minutes laughing out loud (too loud sometimes) and smiling. I can imagine that if you are easily offended by fart ( or "shart") jokes or the shiny hiney's of Ben Stiller or Hank Azaria, you may not like this movie.  But really, then, why would you go in the first place?  I was definitely not bored.  The characters were all so much fun- the kind of creepy boss, the obnoxious but extremely lovable best friend, the risk expert who finds something to worry about in any situation, the goofy, scatterbrained ferret- owning waitress/creepy children's book author, the australian who likes to free fall off of tall buildings, the priceless scuba instructor, and the very cute salsa dancer.  Anyway, I loved it , and I'll probably even go see it again.

Well worth a watch. Nothing award winning here but Ben and Jennifer and co do a great job.

How many times can you watch a Stiller / Aniston comedy with the same weak plot over and over again until you finally lost feeling in your legs and start to wonder how movies like this get made? Jennifer Aniston had filmed this movie while also filming Bruce Almighty and her television show Friends. Ben Stiller's character is something between his role in Meet the Parents and Something About Mary. So when it comes to a labor of love, both actors were in this film to make a nice paycheck. At moments the movie is funny because you are forced to laugh. At other times, an entire scene is being held up with a single joke. Is it just me or is Jennifer Aniston always the same character she plays? At first, I thought Aniston was playing the same role that she was i Bruce Almighty. Besides for her role in The Good Girl, Aniston has successfully acted in a number of movies as the same person. As for Stiller, when he is not being a character actor, he too is the same person in all his films.

It's a romantic comedy with Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston in the main roles. The plot is very funny and even not being totally innovative it has some different characteristics from some other romantic comedies. I enjoyed the ending of this movie, something that I usually don't in romantic comedies, and that was because of even being predictable the ending was funny! The Anniston's character is just great. She's funny, nonsensical, but at the same time very independent and sweet. The character played by Stiller is the typical guy who wants a compromise, to be married and have kids; but he will change with her. To the point that near the end he just says: "I don't want to get married. I just want to take you to dinner, sometime this week".I liked the plot, the jokes, the characters, and found it a very entertaining and some kind of different romantic comedy!

The story's not overly engaging, but for some reason Along Came Polly is fun. Ben Stiller just has that knack of being able to embarass himself and we love him for it. You can't help but laugh. But the film is worth a look for Philip Seymour Hoffman, too, as the child actor still looking for recognition -- and work. The basketball court scene is great, but the best is his performance with a community theatre's production of Jesus Christ Superstar. If you've ever been in community theatre, or you've hung out with actors, you'll appreciate this.

I thought this was about a silly romance, so I didn't see it when it first came out. I rented the DVD and I liked it so much I watched it again with my daughter two nights later. I should have known Ben Stiller wouldn't do a totally "straight" movie, but the comedy wasn't so over the top either. It was a perfect blend of comedy and sincerity. One of the stand-out performances came from Hank Azaria. His portrayal of the French scuba instructor, Claude, was a scene-stealer. One of the funniest characters I've seen in a long time. I recommend this as a perfect date movie, or if you're just sitting at home and want to LOL! Be sure to check out the gag reel.

ALONG CAME POLLY (2004) *** Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Debra Messing, Bryan Brown, Hank Azaria, Michele Lee, Bob Dishy, Alec Baldwin, Missi Pyle. Stiller gives another of his patented hapless schmuck romantics turns as newlywed risk management assessor whose marriage is on the rocks when his wife (Messing) has an affair on their honeymoon, sending him back to NYC to assess his life and runs into former junior high friend Aniston who knocks him for a loop despite her flaky demeanor. Frequently funny and evenly paced by writer and first-time director John Hamburg the laughs come often and no thanks to Hoffman as Stiller's sloven has-been actor buddy and Baldwin as his vulgar boss. Despite the toilet humor (surprisingly in somewhat good taste if you can call it that) the film does have a heart and Stiller and Aniston make for a cute couple.

I watched this movie first in the theater back in 2004 and I remember I had a good time. On a second time view, I can say I had a better time.The movie is about a marriage that fails miserably when the recently weds go on their honeymoon. Everything seems just fine until the wife decides to cheat on the husband and that's when things really start to get difficult.The husband, Ben Stiller, has an encounter with an ex-high school friend, the pretty Polly (Aniston) and since then they start dating and trying to make it work although they're very different on every aspect. Stiller is an obsessive compulsive man that can't do wrong on his job, life, and everything else. Polly is a woman that takes life on the light side and doesn't cares about much... anything.They're opposite poles but that makes things work for them. The problem is when Stiller's ex-wife returns looking for him.Then you have a comedic-problematic situation that would be enough to keep you entertained.There are many funny situations that kind of reminded of the popular sitcom "Friends": For example, Stiller decides to write on a computer all about Polly. Her attributes, flaws, and expectations. The same happened on a "Friends" episode where Ross does the same to Rachel (Aniston). And the ending is similar to the episode...So this may sound like a "Friends" spin-off but the movie has unique humor and situations that separate it from any other comedies.Give it a try and you'll be entertained. The best scenes in the movie in my opinion are the "salsa" dance sequences, the final argument with the insurance company, and the whole situation with Aniston's pet.Jennifer Aniston is simply charming, sexy, and funny. Not "funny" like in her "Friends" character. This time she chose the right character and she demonstrates she's a talented actress on the comedy field. Not to mention she looks really, really hot.Ben Stiller is funny as always but he's been typecast. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a great actor and in this movie he can only demonstrate a few comedic skills but that's enough to show he's great.Hank Azaria is an unique talent and he is just hilarious. The same for Alec Baldwin who is an unconventional comedian but every time he demonstrates he's a quality actor. Debra Messing just looks sexy and does nothing much.

Once again, Ben Stiller gives us yet another comedy, about love, life and being an adult nerd. Yet, this sadly doesn't hold a candle to 'Something About Mary', which may have been his best movie of his career.We begin the film, seeing Reuben (Stiller) marrying Lisa (Messing). After their reception they head to St. Bartes, for their honeymoon. While on the beach they meet a French scuba instructor who has offered to take them out on his boat. Rebuen declines because he has a nervous stomach, but he insists that his beautiful new bride go, to make her happy. When he returns later that day to the boat, he finds his wife cheating on him. Upset, and hurt, he flies home, depressed that he has not only lost his wife, but now has decisions to deal with because of hers.Enter Polly. Several days after he returns to New York, his friend takes him to a party where he runs into a waitress (Aniston), whom he went to school with when he was in junior high. He calls her the next day and asks her out. Throughout the rest of the film, he learns how to deal with his phobias, irritations and just how to cut loose.Each time I see this film, it somehow has the opposite effect on me as most, where as normally I grow to love the film more and more, each time I see it, this one actually, seems to get worse and worse with each viewing. It is funny, and it's not a bad film at all, it's clever and cute, it's just that it does tend to lose flavor each time you see it.Aniston and Stiller were equally good in this, and I still recommend it. It's a light comedy, and not at all like, 'The Cable Guy' or 'There's Something About Mary'. So, if you're looking for films that were as dark or adult as those, you won't find it here. But, it still is cute and clever in its own way, so it might still be worth a watch. Plus, Alec Baldwin plays a small part, which is not to be missed.

Ben Stiller is known for wacky characters such as White Goodman from Dodgeball, Tony Perkis in Heavy Weights, and the male model known as Derek Zoolander in Zoolander. But his other roles have been the quiet yet hysterical characters like Gaylord 'Greg' Focker in Meet the Parents and Meet the Focker's. This type of character is perfect for Stiller.In Along Came Polly, Stiller stars as Reuben Feffer, the neurotic, slightly OCD risk-insurance salesman who looks at the outcome of a situation before getting involved. He decides whether or not a person is too much of a liability. Recently married to Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing), who on their honeymoon, decides to "get it on" with the scuba instructor (Hank Azaria). Fleeing back to the states, he meets up with his long time friend Sandy Lyle (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He was a star actor but now is a has been who tries to go back to the top. For starters, he will be headlining the community theater production of Jesus Christ Superstar...as Judas.Now that Reuben is back, he is "free", but isn't ready for a relationship. Since he is still actually married, he decides to just lay low, until he meets an old friend from junior high. Enter Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), the free spirited, total opposite of Reuben who will flip his world upside down. Even though they seem to be on the opposite sides of the love spectrum, Reuben is crazy for her...hesitant...but still into it.What makes this movie work is the combination of wacky humor and romance. Hoffman is hysterical as Lyle who thinks he is the cats meow. With his life being filmed for a feature on his life, Lyle is confident and even tries to be Reuben's mentor. Although they don't see eye to eye with certain issues, the two have a sort of brotherly bond that lasts thru thick and thin. Aniston is great as Polly and with the addition of Stiller, the two become a great duo, feeding off of each other's energy.This movie is a great date flick and is even a good film to just pop in once and a while. Ben Stiller is on a roll with making movies these days and this is no exception. Along Came Polly is fantastic and worth watching. Another triumph for Stiller...and as Sandy Lyle once said, "Let it rain!"

It starts off slowly because you need to be set up for the story line. Once it picks up, it becomes side splitting.Here is a movie that is difficult to predict where it is going to go but oh what a ride as it gets there. I may be the only person in the world who didn't think something about Mary (sorry--keyboard is broken and won't capitalize consistently) wasn't funny so I thought this movie was much better done, especially with the toilet humor.Excellent performance by Hank azaria (I didn't recognize him).a good movie to watch when it's too nasty to go outside. I wouldn't recommend eating popcorn while watching it because you may choke because you're laughing so hard.

Ben and Jen do their best to overcome an unengaging story and a lack of forward momentum in Along Came Polly. There are some decent laughs throughout, but nothing that stuck with me after the credits. It's not awful by any means, but it's pretty forgettable.

This was a pleasant enough movie. It would have been released when Aniston was in her final year of "Friends". A pleasure of this is that she holds her own against Ben Stiller.Hank Azaria is always a laugh! First, he was a boyfriend with Phoebe on "Friends", and this time he did a terrific job with the accent! He has a couple moments in this movie where I laughed myself into tears! I never discovered this film until it was almost four years old, and I wonder why I never saw it before. You will not be disappointed as a fan of Stiller and Aniston.Great stuff!

Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston lead a talented cast and for the most part deliver the laughs. Reuben Feffer {Ben Stiller} is looking for a new relationship after walking in on his wife {Debra Messing} with a scuba diving instructor {Hank Azaria}. While at a party he sees Polly {Jennifer Aniston} this girl he used to go to school with, they start dating and Reuben is trying to act more loose for Polly since Polly is very loose. The plot is very similar to There's Something About Mary and it even steals from an episode of Friends. The film is not very original so that's one strike against it lucky for the film it has a funny cast. What really makes this movie work is Philip Seymour Hoffman, he is hilarious as Sandy and he is the best part about this movie. The rest of the supporting cast is funny including Hank Azaria as the scuba instructor and Alex Baldwin as Reuben's boss. Ben Stiller is funny but its getting tiring to see him in the same role. Jennifer Aniston pretty much plays her Rachel character and she's enjoyable. The problem though is that Ben and Jen don't make a realistic couple. We have also seen it all before so there's no reason to rush out and see this film. Rating 7/10, a funny movie that's worth a look

I heard this movie was a hard sell, which is probably why I ended up enjoying it so thoroughly. The movie is far from perfect  the talented cast is somewhat misdirected - but it's their talent, along with the hilarious circumstances that unfold throughout the film's neat 90 min running time, which keeps the film moving and the laughter rolling. Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston strike a nice contrast as the fated couple united by a hysterical comedy of errors. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as Stiller's pitiful (and only) friend and confidant. And Alec Baldwin steals every scene in which he appears (would love to see him do more comedy).I am not easily offended by bathroom humor  quite the opposite, I think it's funny when pulled off right. Whenever I read viewers complaining about so-called 'gross-out humor' or "toilet bowl comedy", I am genuinely confused. When the hell did we get so uptight? Fart jokes and bedroom humor have comprised some of the funniest scenes ever filmed (Jeff Daniels in "Dumb & Dumber" or "Chris Tucker" in Friday, for example). I'd recommend this harmless and enjoyable movie to my mother (toilet humor, and all!).

Ben Stiller is a fine actor, and a good comedic one. He has always been recognized because of his comedic roles. But there's a time, when we always seem to be watching the same thing. We say: "I've seen this before, it's familiar". It will be more familiar, when the writer and director of this movie is John Hamburg; who wrote two of Stiller's comedies in the past few years ("Meet the Parents", "Zoolander"). This guy is very funny, really. But he should think about putting some freshness in his material from now on. This is why we can't enjoy Ben Stiller as we usually do, and that's a shame.Jokes. There's another animal, here, too. It's a ferret, and it's blind. Some little jokes occur when it crashes anything, because it can't see. Remember animals? The cat, in "Meet the parents" (or the dog in "There's something about Mary", another Stiller comedy). The whole thing, about the man loosing it, and replacing it for another one that destroys everything. And the jokes with the cat in the bathroom. The bathroom is always present. We sense the farts, when Polly and Reuben are eating. Then, when they both arrive at Polly's house, he says he needs to use the bathroom. We hear the farts. And the only reason why we don't hear them louder, it's because it would be just as any other film, with this scene in it. The louder sound it's replaced with some cleaning jokes. And in the "salsa" club, when Reuben dances. It could have been a very funny scene, but Stiller looks a lot as his character in "Zoolander", dancing, with his faces. A shame, again.The romance is quite familiar, we know. We sense (again) what will happen when Javi (a gay person who dances salsa; "Hector plays the keyboards...") tells Reuben that Polly is leaving town. We are about to see the "I'll catch her before she leaves" scene. And Reuben runs, as usual, but she has already left, although she returns five minutes later.Talking about she, Polly is an interesting character after all. And Jennifer Aniston plays it in a very nice way. She (Aniston) is a good comedic actress. She played comedy for years ("Friends"), and played some nice characters in "Picture Perfecr" and in "Bruce Almighty". She continues to grow.The rest of the cast is all-star. They're all funny. And of course, there's also the best character in the film and the best performance, given by the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He makes Sandy so disgusting and so charming at the same time. Seriously, he steals the film. He brings the freshness to the movie and has the funniest moments, you'll see.To watch Ben Stiller, you should check out the previously mentioned "Something About Mary" and "Meet the Parents" (not "Zoolander"), or maybe "Mystery Men", which is interesting.I laughed.

The film belongs to the demential genre, it's a comedy like "There's something about Mary" -actually there's the same actor, and the same screenwriter of recent Ben Stiller movies as well.We laugh sometimes, but (as it often happens) we see that the most comical moments were in the trailer! Ben Stiller always does the same character -the Jewish young man, awkward and jinxed-, with a beauty to court (this time is Jennifer Aniston).Everything here is predictable, nothing surprises us. The film wants to be politically incorrect as well, but many lines and situations are really vulgar. A bad film you can easily forget.

Add me to the list of folks who saw this film under duress, since some friends were going and I decided to tag along just to see them.  I was pleasantly surprised at this film, since I'm no big Stiller fan and can take or leave Aniston (having just seen one of her previous rom-coms Picture Perfect).It's a by-the-numbers, perfectly acceptable opposites-attract rom-com, with an unfortunate overlay of gross-out humor that seems to have been added by someone along the way to change the tone of the film.  But this gross-out stuff is loaded towards the start, so once it's out of the way the two stars can get back to business - which is pushing and pulling each other until Stiller can "see the light."  Interesting how there's no attempt to show that Aniston's character has to or is interested in changing, it all comes from Stiller's character, who frankly is in a fine position in his life and really doesn't need the "wildness" that Aniston is supposed to represent.I was impressed by how they handle the wandering-wife-comes-back storyline, she presents herself quite humbly and asks for forgiveness and frankly he would have been better off going to counseling with her and getting on with his life in suburbia.  But hey, everyone knows (in movies, anyway) that you're supposed to spend your life with the person who's least like you. Har de har har, good luck to that!

While in his honeymoon in a paradisaical beach, the conservative risk analyst of an insurance company Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) finds his wife Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing) having intercourse with her scuba instructor Claude (Hank Azaria) in his boat. The cuckold Reuben immediately returns to New York and his friend Sandy Lyle (Philip Seymour Hoffman) invites him to go to a party. There he meets his former high school friend Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), who is a very independent woman that lives in the edge with her blind ferret in a cozy but simple apartment. Although having very different behaviors, they date and fell a great attraction for each other. When Lisa returns, Reuben has to decide if he wants to live his life in the suburb with his unfaithful wife, or have a risky relationship with Polly."Along Came Polly" is a good entertainment, where the beauty of Jennifer Aniston shines. The story is funny, and I was almost hypnotized with the cute Jennifer Aniston, who is also a great comedian. I also can understand the reaction of Reuben with Polly, since she is "too much sand for the truck of Ben Stiller". There is an interesting discussion in the Message Boards about the hypothesis of Jack Black performing the role of Sandy. I like Philip Seymour Hoffman very much, he has a good performance in this film, but indeed the character of Sandy Lyle seems to be tailored for Jack Black. Good perception of this user. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Quero Ficar Com Polly" ("I Want to Stay With Polly")Obs.: On 28 December 2008, I watched this funny comedy again.

Over the years of all the comedies I've saw this one "Along Came Polly" has to be one of the better ones, and it's probably one of the better films of 2004. It's filled with plenty of laughs, humor, and the search and trying of finding a new love from an old friend is nice and neat. Funny guy Ben Stiller plays Reuben Feffer a hard working insurance adjuster who's just recently married his elegant and attractive sweetheart Lisa(Debra Messing)and upon their honeymoon Reuben finds out that he's been cheated on right away! So now that all seems lost it's back to his job with gruff and tough boss Stan(Alec Baldwin)then one day when his washed up actor turned Broadway star friend Snady(Philip Seymour Hoffman) introduces him to an old friend at a party a renewed spirit is introduced! Upon meeting Polly Prince(Jennifer Aniston) who's an old high school friend who's back in town after moving around from many jobs she's now trying her go at being a party and cocktail waitress. And the old saying is true opposites attract as both attitudes are different with Reuben being nervous and neurotic and very cautious of the world while Polly is a liberal and a very free spirited person. Yet as both get to know each other it proves opposites attract and love and happiness is possible! Overall this is a nice and cute little comedy made watchable by Ben and Jen.

Blind ferrets, IBS, base-jumping ... "Along Came Polly" is one of those situational humor comedies that takes a basic romantic comedy plot and surrounds it with the bizarre whether it's ridiculous situations or zany characters. Creator John Hamburg takes two likely comedy protagonists -- a risk-assessing neurotic type (Ben Stiller) and the free-spirited unpredictable type (Jennifer Aniston) who come together after Stiller's character's wife cheats on their honeymoon -- and puts them in outrageous situations and dealing with strange characters to amp up the humor. It's hit or miss, but the creative thought behind it keeps it laudable and interesting.These are two characters that Stiller and Aniston have proved more than capable of playing. As their unlikely relationship unfolds, it's more about how they handle the more extreme characters and situations. Philip Seymour Hoffman, for example, is Stiller's best friend is an "actor" who still tries to pretend as if a movie he did years ago gives him an excuse to be arrogant. Hank Azaria plays a french nudist scuba instructor as only he -- master of accents -- can. Alec Baldwin even plays the unethical, awkwardly buddy-buddy boss of Stiller's character. It's not so much Stiller's ability to do comedy as it is for him to react to these actors doing great character work.The situational comedy is also incredibly diverse and wildly unpredictable: whether it's the first date where Stiller's IBS kicks in after eating spicy food and he can't discretely use the restroom or the scene when he and Aniston get in a fight while on a sailboat plunging through a storm so that the entire scene they're getting thrown around the set. Nothing is that incredibly funny, but it's all about unique situations that you haven't seen in movies before that amuse you as you follow the story."Polly" is not refreshing or innovative, but it's creative takes using traditional comedy techniques and its killer supporting cast keep it very entertaining. You don't really care if Stiller and Aniston stay together in the end, you're more interested in what the other characters are going to say/do/influence them along the way.

Along Came Polly (2004)Along Came Polly is not Ben Stiller's best film nor his best performance but I really enjoyed it. It's not that original but it is still somehow fresh. It is pretty well written and there are plenty of memorable and distinct moments that make it more recognizable and original than the storyline itself would make it seem like it would. The bathroom scene, the ferret and the basketball scene are a few of these moments. As far as acting goes, Ben Stiller does what he usually does. He makes you laugh and believe his character but doesn't actually act wonderfully, which doesn't seem to make sense. His performance is similar to that in There's Something About Mary. Jennifer Aniston also gives the same performance as almost everything she's done, which isn't good but it works out fine all together. The best character and performance in the film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He has a very strange role in comparison to most of his other work, and he does it great. He was very hilarious and did really good, he kept the film more watchable, though he had a small role. Hank Azaria also had a very funny yet even smaller role that added more character to the otherwise average film. Any fan of Ben Stiller or Jennifer Aniston will most likely enjoy Along Came Polly. It's nothing extremely special and it's not the funniest movie, but it has a good story and has many good laughs. Definitely worth watching if it's on TV or something, but not really something you need to run out and rent, unless, like I said, you are a big fan of Stiller or Aniston. 7/10

Along Came Polly is a comedy featuring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, as two former high school classmates, who begin a new romance after a chance meeting years later.There are several scenes that I got a good laugh out of, like the overflowing toilet bit and the basketball er how shall I say, "mishap". Hank Azaria was also pretty funny as the Francophone scuba diver (too bad he gets such limited screen time). Oh yes, and the accident prone ferret is also a cute recurring joke.But overall the film misses more that it hits. It never really settles on much of a direction until the predictable conclusion. It just meanders from one location to the next, with an occasional sight gag thrown in for good measure (only 2 or 3 of which are really that funny). Ben and Jen's characters have no believable chemistry. Philip Seymor Hoffman's former child actor character is annoying and feels forced (look at me I'm trying to be wacky and unconventional, give me some attention already!). The subplot of some wealthy thrill seeker trying to get approved for insurance, or whatever, is just pointless and really adds nothing to the main plot or provides any laughs.We also have Stiller playing essentially the same role he's been playing for the bulk of his career, a naïve guy who gets more than he bargained for after starting a new relationship. ACP offers us nothing that Stiller and crew haven't done before and to better effect in films like "Flirting with Disaster", "There's Something About Mary", and "Meet the Parents".All said and done you have another average, flavor of the month comedy, among a sea of countless others like it. Worth catching on TBS if you want something light to kill 90 minutes, otherwise I wouldn't bother.

A comedy about a man named Reuben Feffer(Ben Stiller)meets a woman named Polly Prince(Jennifer Aniston) they are total opposites Polly lives life on the wild side and Reuben lives life on the safe side but as they say opposites attract.Ben Stiller gives a excellent performance as usual.Jennifer Aniston also gives a very good performance.This movie is full of hilarious characters such as his best friend sandy Lyle(Philip Seymour Hoffman),the scuba instructor,Reuben's boss,and a few others.The screenplay was very funny.All around the actors all do a great job especially Sandy Lyle(Philip Seymour Hoffman).The storyline was not lacking anything it was absolutely perfect.The directing was not extremely special but it was not entirely bad either.Best actor/actress-(Philip Seymour Hoffman) A movie full of fun- Jake Hyden I rated this 7 out of 10 Rated-(PG-13) for sexual content,language,crude humor and some drug references.7/10

Cliche is the only word that springs to mind with this film. Throughout practically every part of the film, I was saying to myself "I've seen this dozens of times before." A very standard formula, which is funny in places, but is too predicable to properly enjoy.

I am surprised at the comments that I have read so far that suggest this is a boring or mediocre movie.  All that I know is that I am a 46 year old married mother, and I just spent 90 minutes laughing out loud (too loud sometimes) and smiling. I can imagine that if you are easily offended by fart ( or "shart") jokes or the shiny hiney's of Ben Stiller or Hank Azaria, you may not like this movie.  But really, then, why would you go in the first place?  I was definitely not bored.  The characters were all so much fun- the kind of creepy boss, the obnoxious but extremely lovable best friend, the risk expert who finds something to worry about in any situation, the goofy, scatterbrained ferret- owning waitress/creepy children's book author, the australian who likes to free fall off of tall buildings, the priceless scuba instructor, and the very cute salsa dancer.  Anyway, I loved it , and I'll probably even go see it again.

This is a fun movie, it's entertaining and enjoyable. I don't think Ben stiller is too good in this, I don't think his character has many funny moments. Which is a shame because I like Ben stiller. Philip Seymour Hoffman is really rather funny though.The film is a funny scenario.
But some aspects just don't work.
These two folks went from haven't seen each other since middle school to a committed relationship in like 2 dates. They didn't really establish the relationship between the two. One minute they're uncomfortable talking to each other, the next it seems like they've moved in together. One minute theyre commited boyfriend/girlfriend the next minute they are just friends.This is nit picky though. If you just sit back and enjoy the movie it's rather fun. This movie is a 6.5 or so.
Also I think a 10 year old was in charge of the sound effects department. Everything sounds very gooey and gross.

How many times can you watch a Stiller / Aniston comedy with the same weak plot over and over again until you finally lost feeling in your legs and start to wonder how movies like this get made? Jennifer Aniston had filmed this movie while also filming Bruce Almighty and her television show Friends. Ben Stiller's character is something between his role in Meet the Parents and Something About Mary. So when it comes to a labor of love, both actors were in this film to make a nice paycheck. At moments the movie is funny because you are forced to laugh. At other times, an entire scene is being held up with a single joke. Is it just me or is Jennifer Aniston always the same character she plays? At first, I thought Aniston was playing the same role that she was i Bruce Almighty. Besides for her role in The Good Girl, Aniston has successfully acted in a number of movies as the same person. As for Stiller, when he is not being a character actor, he too is the same person in all his films.
