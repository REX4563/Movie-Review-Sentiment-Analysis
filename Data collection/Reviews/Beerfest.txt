Its not brilliant and it doesn't try to be. If you go into this movie knowing you are watching a movie called beerfest, you should have a good time. A lot of jokes flying fast and does not take itself seriously, which is a good thing sometimes. I mean, there was a lot of hyped movies this summer that really let down and took themselves too seriously, so sometimes its great to get a movie that knows it's dumb and revels in it. Lots of gratuitous nudity, cursing, and stupidity make this one a lot of fun. It may not have the great jokes like super troopers did, but it's just as funny. Perfect type of movie when you just need to let go for a couple hours. So, if you like broken lizard, watch this movie. If you don't, stop watching their movies and complaining that they're not funny. I give it a 7 just cause it took my mind off reality for a while and I laughed quite a bit.

After the death of their grandfather Johann von Wolfhaus (Donald Sutherland), the brothers Jan (Paul Soter) and Todd Wolfhouse (Erik Stolhanske) travel to Munich to fulfill a family tradition, spreading the ashes of Johann during the Oktoberfest. Their contact brings them to a secret beer competition, the Beerfest", where they are offended by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen (Juergen Prochnow) and the German branch of their family that accuse their grand grandmother of being a prostitute and their grandfather of stealing an old receipt of the best beer in Germany. Jan and Todd returns to USA humiliated and decide to organize a beer team to dispute the next Beerfest. They join Landfill (Kevin Heffernan), Barry (Jay Chandrasekhar) and Fink (Steve Lemme) and train long the year to participate in the competition. When they find the lost receipt hidden in a dummy, they feel that their German relatives told the truth. But the team is ready for the tough dispute."Beerfest" is one of those silly, scatological and politically incorrect mindless movies that are not accepted by professional critics, but entertains and makes laugh ordinary viewers like me. It is certainly necessary to shutdown the brain and stop thinking to enjoy the low-level and gross jokes, but what is better than watching this type of film to relieve the daily stress of work and personal problems? I confess that I love to watch every now and then this type of comedy which changes my mood for better with a perfect combination of beer and fun. The participation of Willie Nelson in the end is hilarious and a good hook for a "Potfest". My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Beerfest"

Beerfest is such a cleverly funny and entertaining movie. It's purposely bad acting and writing yet it is still high quality and has so many timeless jokes and lines to reference. Legitimately one of the funniest movies of all time.

From the first few minutes on "Beerfest" heads straight into debauchery without making any excuses for it. However, this movie is closer to classic National Lampoon movies such as "Animal House" or "European Vacation" than to the vulgar sex-comedies that have been so popular ever since "American Pie". Make no mistake, "Beerfest" is full of nudity, dick jokes and all kinds of deliberate lowbrow humor. The difference to aforementioned sex-comedies is that "Beerfest"'s stupidity is much more self-aware and also aimed at an audience that understands this and can laugh about it from one step away. Or to make it sound less pretentious: this comedy has a lot of heart. When Germans are merely primitive giants in this movie it's clear that this is a comedic stereotype that must not be taken seriously by any means. The Germans and the depiction of German traditions is really the highlight of this movie.Like Broken Lizard's previous theatrical adventure "State Troopers" this one is mindless, silly fun with a great cast, but all in all "Beerfest" is the better movie. Not a classic, but very enjoyable.

Most of it is quite funny. It is a bit long and there were some antics that could have been cut easily. Still, much fun and far better than Club dread, which I couldn't even finish watching.It occurs to me that people who hate Beerfest probably had a ping-pong paddle shoved up their youknowwhat. Not just the handle.

You can't go in to this movie expecting it to be a great piece of art, the director did after all do "Dukes of Hazard" but it is mildly entertaining and has a few moments where it shines. To be as concise as I can be- It is funny, it makes you want to go to Munich and drink lots of beer (just like Goodfellas makes me want to smoke cigarettes) and it has a good heart. In my neck of the woods a matin√©e is $7.50 and that was about what I'd say it was worth. It can vary slightly at times from the plot to make a bad joke, and it gets a little hokey after the funeral (I'm not spoiling anything there) but it has a few classic lines, some interesting comments on society and American prejudices, dishes slightly below the belt without offending anyone, is filled with toilet humor, and throws in some eye candy to (das) boot. If you know your Germanic cinema history there are some subtle and not so subtle homages. Just like SoaP, don't go in expecting art, and you will come out with a smile. Ribbit!

I went and saw a screening of Beerfest yesterday and I have to say I pleasantly surprised. I went in with unrealistically high hopes as Super Troopers was one of my favorite comedies of all time. Although this movie stands on it's own, Super Troopers is the clear winner in my opinion. However, Beerfest was better than Club Dread. Beerfest has some off the wall situations that many reviewers say ruined it. I disagree as they were some of the more funny parts and it IS a movie after all. I knew this would be a great movie literally 5 seconds into it. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone that liked the Broken Lizard movies. A warning though, People in AA shouldn't go and see this movie as you will probably end up at the bar afterwords like I did.

Unfortunately me and my other half couldn't decide what to see when we got to the cinema. And we ended up seeing this load of tripe! Right from the start I knew I was in for 2 hours of boredom. The "German" spoken in this movie is barely passable. In fact did they even consult anyone who spoke the language when they made the film? Because half of it is made up.The "Das Boot" joke was shocking. Though by that point I had come to expect that type of inane predictability.My boyfriend at least thought it was passable, but only because of all the scantily clad women featured.The best thing about this movie was the outtakes, and they weren't even that good.

Many critics are heavily scolding this movie as a stupid, drunken frat-boy romp filled to the brim with crude humor and bad taste. I'd tend to agree with them, aside from this one addition -- it's absolutely hilarious.From the truly side-splitting opening scene with Grand-papa to the final confrontation before the credits roll, you'll be entertained. The acting and gags are right on the mark for the admittedly low-brow appeal that this movie is shooting for. In that regard, it's no surprise that BeerFest won't get any Oscar nods. But to those of us who appreciate the suds and debauchery of five cartoonish characters embroiled in "a super secret international beer drinking contest to take on the Germans for national pride", this is an instant classic.To be fair, BeerFest utilizes a much feebler narrative than some of it's gross-out contemporaries, such as Van Wilder, but definitely has a much stronger vision than something like Harold & Kumar go to White Castle. Within this genre, the latter is a fine movie as well -- BeerFest simply stays on track a little better, instead of being a slapdash montage of funny scenes. That said, BeerFest really triumphs by giving us characters so lampoon, you are able to sit back and enjoy two hours of gaseous gaffs without too much mental investment. And that's a good thing every now and then, right? If not, I feel very sad for your sedate, austere funny-bone.For the rest of us, a toast. Raise your mugs for BeerFest, the drunken orgy of comedy that will keep you laughing!

I actually had two German weissbeers while watching this movie and had a really, really good time watching this flick.Its infantile, incorrect, immature, ridiculous and how I loved it. I will not give a synopsis of the movie as it really doesn't matter what the story is about. What matters is, that the movie focuses on some of the aspects of living that we think of as teenage-like and embarrassing but still some of us (including me) still have a soft spot for:Drinking beer and while doing that ending up in all kinds of weird situations.Drinking beer and getting wasted.Drinking beer and having the worst of hangovers that you could possible imagine.Drinking beer and doing things that you so much regret when you sober up.The female body.I think that one of the reasons that a movie like this emerges is, that in this day and age we are so much expected to behave in a rational, controlled way and never stop thinking about our career and responsibility that the other side of our personality that contains the "letting go" and not caring about anything but having a good time is hidden away in the dark (again I am talking about myself).I really don't think that any girl would be able to understand the humor in this movie unless they are Australian or British.This is not a great movie but it worked for me because I could recognize my own darker sides so many times in this film - and because I could it made me believe that other guys have them too.Cheers....SimonPs.

How much "Budweiser" must the producer consumed I asked me. Or have they drunk that, what they sad Germans would drink as babies? You know what I mean, that what come out of cows, they said.The film was one of the greatest flops in the German theatrical history. Some screenings, no visitors. No wonder .... our real "beerfest's" are much better and more funny. We have very often nudes and chests of women on free TV or in summer, when we go swimming. So we don't need such films.The film is good enough for the typical US-visitor who doesn't know anything about any country outside states. A country where drama breaks out when Mrs. Jackson showing her chest and everybody can buy guns to shot people.

Let me start by saying that I loved Super Troopers. Club Dread on the other hand was not one of my favorites. So i was hoping that this would be better than Club Dread but I did not think it could even compare to Super Troopers. But was i wrong. This movie was absolutely hilarious.I just don't understand why people are giving it terrible reviews. It was the funniest movie I have seen in theatres in a long time(as well as Clerks II). I understand the lack of plot but who says lets go see Beerfest, it will probably be a great epic? I went to see people drink beer, get wasted and do stupid things and thats exactly what I got.I laughed from the beginning to the end of the movie, there was not a dull moment in the whole thing. And when the American team was competing against the other countries, I was cheering as if i was watching a real professional sport.So, if you are looking for a good laugh and an all around good time go see Beerfest you will not be disappointed.

So bad it's entertaining! There's a stupid story with Beerfest, but with such a name what does the viewer expect. Well it starts out with a Wedding which is silly/memorable. The characters are flat but stupid. The brothers of a lost brewery, with trouble from the old country Germany. With the death of grandpa (Donald Sutherland) the brothers must take the ashes back to the homeland; humiliated and dealing with old family feud the brothers must go back to Colorado and assemble a team for the beer Olympics. Sex humor, low ball humor, racial humor there is no low Beerfest will not go. The party crasher scene, the landfill character, and many low bro jokes actually culminates into a funny movie; hard act to pull off. Something one watches late while having a beer. 7 stars.

If you like American movies with no story, lots of bullshit and if your desperate for getting the typical American brainwash then this movie is all yours.I can never understand that this movie get a rating over 1.1. I don't want to use bad language but this is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The producer should never, ever be aloud to produce this type of low quality film, ever..... Im to angry to write what I really think about this crap and I pity the people that rent/watched this movie. I feel even worse for the actors working on this film with no real chances to make themselfes understood and appreciated.

Love me a good beer and this movie has got a whole lot of beers!! They drink, they laugh, they cry, they beer, and at the very end (SPOIILLERSSS!!! DO NOT REEAD!) they drink a boot of beer and belch and beer! Pot movie coming next.

So far, I've enjoyed all the Broken Lizard films at least to a degree. "Beerfest" is a little less quirky and original than their previous efforts, but it works. Like all the Broken Lizard films, the film is uneven, with certain gags coming off as just plain silly. I saw the punchline to the "beer goggles" gag coming a mile away. Most of the gags work, though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments, like in "Super Troopers." I'm an avid beer drinker myself, so I couldn't help but enjoy this film to a certain degree. I'm not going to say this is the funniest comedy of the decade, but it's worth watching, whether you're a Broken Lizard fan or not.

'Beerfest' is the fourth movie made by the writing/acting group Broken Lizard consisting of Paul Soter, Erik Stolhanske, Kevin Heffernan, and Jay Chan,,,uh Chan¬ÖChandrasekhar (Yeah, that's it!). After the death of their grandfather, Todd and Jan Wolfhouse set off to Germany during Oktoberfest to deliver his ashes. Although they do become a tad sidetracked with the festivities, they eventually meet the man that will take them to their grandfather's final resting place, which just so happens to be the site of a worldwide beer drinking tournament.'Beerfest,' like the other movies made by the Broken Lizard crew is not only hilarious, but just so well put together. The characters are genuine, the writing fantastic, the acting amazing, and the beer¬Öoh the beer! This movie, while completely enjoyable sober, is certainly enhanced by a few cervezas (as our neighbors to the south would say). 'Beerfest' actually happens to be number one on my list of the best movies to watch when you are drinking, which can be viewed at http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000527140/. I have read many negative critic reviews for this movie, and I must say to those critics, "with all due respect, are you on crack?!"

I personally enjoy many of the stoner/drinker type movies and this was no exception. An overall okay movie, the idea of the beerfest just couldn't keep me fixed to the screen. It had it's laughs and belches, but the overall plot was weak and some of the lines you could see coming. If you can't handle the low level acting, then grab a boot of beer or two and I guarantee you won't care about that anymore. You would also think that the guy who knew all about beer would have had some type of pill that would allow them to drink without the adverse affects of the alcohol. I mean, hell, Poindexter on Revenge of the Nerds had one!! I give it a six.... I'll leave it at that...If you have time,check it out. I could not see myself paying retail price for the DVD, however, renting or borrowing from a friend would be your best bet.

This is one of the unfunniest films I have ever seen, I'm just glad it was "orange Wednesday" and I only payed half price.The story(I use the term loosely)was plodding, predictable and uneventful. The national stereotypes offensive and just not funny. This film could make USA even less popular with the countries it slurs. Everyone makes mistakes, it's part of learning, I just wish the makers would have had the good grace to spare the world this kind of thoughtless racist tripe. It took dumbing down to a new level...Way to go. A little research would not have gone amiss either, for example, the Union Jack is not the flag of England, it is the Cross of St George. In conclusion, one to avoid.

They basically invent an entire language in this film, and it created an actual phenomena of Beerfest parties in the US following it's release. I'll be frank, if this movie doesn't make you laugh, then you simply aren't a person I want to hang around. It's THAT funny to me. Sorry not sorry. Should be 8.3/10 cumulative. Ridiculous.

.....comes Dodgeball with beer (fill in the blank at this point : _____ with beer. ie, "BASEketball" with beer, "Cheech and Chong" with beer, etc). After the death of their German grandfather (Donald Sutherland, who's cameo is obviously part of the plea bargain agreement with some law enforcement, somewhere), our beer-guzzling heroes go to Munich, Germany to complete their dead, drunken grandfather's last wish : to have his urn brought to the BeerFeast (kind of like the competition from Bloodsport, with beer and except without the killing and fighting. Those have been replaced by quarters and beer chugging). There they encounter their distant German cousins and uncle, who promptly disgrace them by beating them at beer drinking (and making them wear their uncle back to the airport). This becomes the point of the rest of the movie. That is the 12 month, Rocky-like training regime of beer related activity, where they bond and have kooky adventures while learning the real meaning of Christmas (okay. that last part doesn't happened).Everything else you can probably figure out very easily, even after several 6 packs. This movie is definitely geared towards the "drinking" collegiate-humor crowd. To tell the truth, I had found the humor in Jay Chandrasekhar's movies to be a little underwhelming, like watching Will Ferrel in Ron Burgundy or Ricky Bobby. Don't get me wrong, I'm the last person not to appreciate sausage warming (performed by Frau Bl√ºcher herself, the Leechman), frog sperm collecting, Schwarzenegger quotes and an unquenchable ocean of beer. Its amusing, but thats about it. Its not as bad as most things Adam Sandler touches (Grandma's Boy is an exception but his influence is limited to just being one of a few executive producers), but definitely not in league with Grandma's Boy, Half-Baked, the Cheech and Chong Trilogy (Up in Smoke, Next Movie and Nice Dreams), Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, Fear and Loathing and Office Space. The cameo's by Das Boot's J√ºrgen Prochnow, Will Forte and the German Chin - Ralf Moeller are nice but minor. Its not even worth a watch over pizza and many, many beers. It's like when you were 20 and you couldn't afford good alcohol so you binged on the water and empty calories contained in $1 Buds drafts. You'll get wasted, but you'll hate yourself in the morning.

Seeing this movie with a rating of over 6 shows me some of the problems with the IMDb. This is possibly the worst movie I have ever watched and I have seen Epic movie and Date movie. Having checked through other rating I notice a correlation with the votes. Every single person who voted 9 or 10 stars is from the USA. Surprise surprise. This movie is boring, I never laughed once, offensive (if you're German or English) the special effects were a joke and the story was shocking not to mention the acting. The whole 'Landfill' dying and then his Texan twin brother appearing at the wake asking to join the drinking team and be called 'Landfill' too, was a dire waste of 20 Min's of the movie. I noted that 'team England' stood under the Union flag (union jack to you yanks) yet there was also a team from Scotland competing who stood under the Saltire (flag of Scotland) surely 'team England' should have stood under the Georges cross!!! Now the film makers were obviously aware of the difference because when it showed the atlas illustrating the main characters on their plane bringing the ashes to Germany near the beginning of the film, it showed the 4 territories of the UK (England, Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland) in a different colour. Why just presume that because you show a Union Jack, everyone who stands under it is English and has a terrible cockney accent. It's those little things that really annoy me. This film demonstrates why the world today generally despises the USA and the sooner Hollywood realise this and stops offending our intelligence the better. Here is a suggestion, why not make a film about how the USA who are allegedly a nation against world terrorism, through the north American Irish republican group NORAID, collected millions of US dollars to fund the IRA war in Northern Ireland. America, you have a lot to answer for.

Beerfest has got to be the funniest movie of year. It's one of those classic movies you just watch with your buddies and laugh your asses off over and over because some of the scenes just catch you off guard. And trust me if you love drinking and can relate in one way or another to some of these drinking scenes, you'll laugh hella hard. Beerfest isn't trying to beat out other comedic movies rather it brilliantly just let's the humor ride on its own level without force feeding comedy to the audience; naturally funny, laugh so hard you cry typa movie, Beerfest is simply downright hilarious. I totally recommend everyone to go and watch this movie because it's different and it's guaranteed to make you laugh.

This movie Beerfest is a movie about a bunch of guys getting drunk via competition if I am not mistaken. I think this is a new idea for movies to take a them and extend it as far as possible. In an SNL limited idea sort of a way; reminds me of night at the Roxbury. Now that was a good movie I'm gonna write a review on that after this. So this movie is something I cannot put my eyes across again because its just too 1 dimensional to keep by attention again. Then again it just me of is this movie just for college guys looking to get drunk and laid. Old school was better, now old school was an awesome movie. So still the movie rates of me meter of 7 out of 10 still good.

Only time watching this was on a long bus ride. Never again... Our group got half way through it when we started to riot about how bad and stupid the movie was when we finally put in "Tommy Boy" to ease the pain of Beerfest.The only 'slightly' amusing part of this whole movie was the opening scene. That was it. The rest was stupid and crude that might appeal to the ages 16-20 crowd. Whats the point if they can't even drink? All this movie was about was drinking...You could just be short and simple and call it Stupid. Beerfest has nothing to offer at all. If you must, watch the first scene and turn it off. There are so many movies that are much better than this, if you have half a mind you won't waste your time on this garbage.

Its not brilliant and it doesn't try to be. If you go into this movie knowing you are watching a movie called beerfest, you should have a good time. A lot of jokes flying fast and does not take itself seriously, which is a good thing sometimes. I mean, there was a lot of hyped movies this summer that really let down and took themselves too seriously, so sometimes its great to get a movie that knows it's dumb and revels in it. Lots of gratuitous nudity, cursing, and stupidity make this one a lot of fun. It may not have the great jokes like super troopers did, but it's just as funny. Perfect type of movie when you just need to let go for a couple hours. So, if you like broken lizard, watch this movie. If you don't, stop watching their movies and complaining that they're not funny. I give it a 7 just cause it took my mind off reality for a while and I laughed quite a bit.

With the death of grandpa (Donald Sutherland) the brothers must take the ashes back to the homeland; humiliated and dealing with old family feud the brothers must go back to Colorado and assemble a team for the beer Olympics. Sex humor, low ball humor, racial humor there is no low Beerfest will not go. The party crasher scene, the landfill character, and many low bro jokes actually culminates into a funny movie; hard act to pull off. Something one watches late while having a beer. 7 stars.

If you like American movies with no story, lots of bullshit and if your desperate for getting the typical American brainwash then this movie is all yours.I can never understand that this movie get a rating over 1.1. I don't want to use bad language but this is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The producer should never, ever be aloud to produce this type of low quality film, ever..... Im to angry to write what I really think about this crap and I pity the people that rent/watched this movie. I feel even worse for the actors working on this film with no real chances to make themselfes understood and appreciated.

Love me a good beer and this movie has got a whole lot of beers!! They drink, they laugh, they cry, they beer, and at the very end (SPOIILLERSSS!!! DO NOT REEAD!) they drink a boot of beer and belch and beer! Pot movie coming next.

So far, I've enjoyed all the Broken Lizard films at least to a degree. "Beerfest" is a little less quirky and original than their previous efforts, but it works. Like all the Broken Lizard films, the film is uneven, with certain gags coming off as just plain silly. I saw the punchline to the "beer goggles" gag coming a mile away. Most of the gags work, though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments, like in "Super Troopers." I'm an avid beer drinker myself, so I couldn't help but enjoy this film to a certain degree. I'm not going to say this is the funniest comedy of the decade, but it's worth watching, whether you're a Broken Lizard fan or not.

'Beerfest' is the fourth movie made by the writing/acting group Broken Lizard consisting of Paul Soter, Erik Stolhanske, Kevin Heffernan, and Jay Chan,,,uh Chan¬ÖChandrasekhar (Yeah, that's it!). After the death of their grandfather, Todd and Jan Wolfhouse set off to Germany during Oktoberfest to deliver his ashes. Although they do become a tad sidetracked with the festivities, they eventually meet the man that will take them to their grandfather's final resting place, which just so happens to be the site of a worldwide beer drinking tournament.'Beerfest,' like the other movies made by the Broken Lizard crew is not only hilarious, but just so well put together. The characters are genuine, the writing fantastic, the acting amazing, and the beer¬Öoh the beer! This movie, while completely enjoyable sober, is certainly enhanced by a few cervezas (as our neighbors to the south would say). 'Beerfest' actually happens to be number one on my list of the best movies to watch when you are drinking, which can be viewed at http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000527140/. I have read many negative critic reviews for this movie, and I must say to those critics, "with all due respect, are you on crack?!"

I personally enjoy many of the stoner/drinker type movies and this was no exception. An overall okay movie, the idea of the beerfest just couldn't keep me fixed to the screen. It had it's laughs and belches, but the overall plot was weak and some of the lines you could see coming. If you can't handle the low level acting, then grab a boot of beer or two and I guarantee you won't care about that anymore. You would also think that the guy who knew all about beer would have had some type of pill that would allow them to drink without the adverse affects of the alcohol. I mean, hell, Poindexter on Revenge of the Nerds had one!! I give it a six.... I'll leave it at that...If you have time,check it out. I could not see myself paying retail price for the DVD, however, renting or borrowing from a friend would be your best bet.

This is one of the unfunniest films I have ever seen, I'm just glad it was "orange Wednesday" and I only payed half price.The story(I use the term loosely)was plodding, predictable and uneventful. The national stereotypes offensive and just not funny. This film could make USA even less popular with the countries it slurs. Everyone makes mistakes, it's part of learning, I just wish the makers would have had the good grace to spare the world this kind of thoughtless racist tripe. It took dumbing down to a new level...Way to go. A little research would not have gone amiss either, for example, the Union Jack is not the flag of England, it is the Cross of St George. In conclusion, one to avoid.

They basically invent an entire language in this film, and it created an actual phenomena of Beerfest parties in the US following it's release. I'll be frank, if this movie doesn't make you laugh, then you simply aren't a person I want to hang around. It's THAT funny to me. Sorry not sorry. Should be 8.3/10 cumulative. Ridiculous.

.....comes Dodgeball with beer (fill in the blank at this point : _____ with beer. ie, "BASEketball" with beer, "Cheech and Chong" with beer, etc). After the death of their German grandfather (Donald Sutherland, who's cameo is obviously part of the plea bargain agreement with some law enforcement, somewhere), our beer-guzzling heroes go to Munich, Germany to complete their dead, drunken grandfather's last wish : to have his urn brought to the BeerFeast (kind of like the competition from Bloodsport, with beer and except without the killing and fighting. Those have been replaced by quarters and beer chugging). There they encounter their distant German cousins and uncle, who promptly disgrace them by beating them at beer drinking (and making them wear their uncle back to the airport). This becomes the point of the rest of the movie. That is the 12 month, Rocky-like training regime of beer related activity, where they bond and have kooky adventures while learning the real meaning of Christmas (okay. that last part doesn't happened).Everything else you can probably figure out very easily, even after several 6 packs. This movie is definitely geared towards the "drinking" collegiate-humor crowd. To tell the truth, I had found the humor in Jay Chandrasekhar's movies to be a little underwhelming, like watching Will Ferrel in Ron Burgundy or Ricky Bobby. Don't get me wrong, I'm the last person not to appreciate sausage warming (performed by Frau Bl√ºcher herself, the Leechman), frog sperm collecting, Schwarzenegger quotes and an unquenchable ocean of beer. Its amusing, but thats about it. Its not as bad as most things Adam Sandler touches (Grandma's Boy is an exception but his influence is limited to just being one of a few executive producers), but definitely not in league with Grandma's Boy, Half-Baked, the Cheech and Chong Trilogy (Up in Smoke, Next Movie and Nice Dreams), Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, Fear and Loathing and Office Space. The cameo's by Das Boot's J√ºrgen Prochnow, Will Forte and the German Chin - Ralf Moeller are nice but minor. Its not even worth a watch over pizza and many, many beers. It's like when you were 20 and you couldn't afford good alcohol so you binged on the water and empty calories contained in $1 Buds drafts. You'll get wasted, but you'll hate yourself in the morning.

Only time watching this was on a long bus ride. Never again... Our group got half way through it when we started to riot about how bad and stupid the movie was when we finally put in "Tommy Boy" to ease the pain of Beerfest.The only 'slightly' amusing part of this whole movie was the opening scene. That was it. The rest was stupid and crude that might appeal to the ages 16-20 crowd. Whats the point if they can't even drink? All this movie was about was drinking...You could just be short and simple and call it Stupid. Beerfest has nothing to offer at all. If you must, watch the first scene and turn it off. There are so many movies that are much better than this, if you have half a mind you won't waste your time on this garbage.

Beerfest has got to be the funniest movie of year. It's one of those classic movies you just watch with your buddies and laugh your asses off over and over because some of the scenes just catch you off guard. And trust me if you love drinking and can relate in one way or another to some of these drinking scenes, you'll laugh hella hard. Beerfest isn't trying to beat out other comedic movies rather it brilliantly just let's the humor ride on its own level without force feeding comedy to the audience; naturally funny, laugh so hard you cry typa movie, Beerfest is simply downright hilarious. I totally recommend everyone to go and watch this movie because it's different and it's guaranteed to make you laugh.

This movie Beerfest is a movie about a bunch of guys getting drunk via competition if I am not mistaken. I think this is a new idea for movies to take a them and extend it as far as possible. In an SNL limited idea sort of a way; reminds me of night at the Roxbury. Now that was a good movie I'm gonna write a review on that after this. So this movie is something I cannot put my eyes across again because its just too 1 dimensional to keep by attention again. Then again it just me of is this movie just for college guys looking to get drunk and laid. Old school was better, now old school was an awesome movie. So still the movie rates of me meter of 7 out of 10 still good.

Seeing this movie with a rating of over 6 shows me some of the problems with the IMDb. This is possibly the worst movie I have ever watched and I have seen Epic movie and Date movie. Having checked through other rating I notice a correlation with the votes. Every single person who voted 9 or 10 stars is from the USA. Surprise surprise. This movie is boring, I never laughed once, offensive (if you're German or English) the special effects were a joke and the story was shocking not to mention the acting. The whole 'Landfill' dying and then his Texan twin brother appearing at the wake asking to join the drinking team and be called 'Landfill' too, was a dire waste of 20 Min's of the movie. I noted that 'team England' stood under the Union flag (union jack to you yanks) yet there was also a team from Scotland competing who stood under the Saltire (flag of Scotland) surely 'team England' should have stood under the Georges cross!!! Now the film makers were obviously aware of the difference because when it showed the atlas illustrating the main characters on their plane bringing the ashes to Germany near the beginning of the film, it showed the 4 territories of the UK (England, Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland) in a different colour. Why just presume that because you show a Union Jack, everyone who stands under it is English and has a terrible cockney accent. It's those little things that really annoy me. This film demonstrates why the world today generally despises the USA and the sooner Hollywood realise this and stops offending our intelligence the better. Here is a suggestion, why not make a film about how the USA who are allegedly a nation against world terrorism, through the north American Irish republican group NORAID, collected millions of US dollars to fund the IRA war in Northern Ireland. America, you have a lot to answer for.
