The start of the movie is good and gripping and it gives you the feel of a good movie in making but after 20-25 minutes the movie start loosing the plot. The movie misleads in between and after a point of time it will feel boring. Action is good, Vin diesel is as good as always. The movie could have been better provided with a good screenplay.

One of those films which I don't think the current IMDb score (5.4) actually captures.It's a bit formulaic - ex-bad-boy super-DEA agent gets the bad guy, pays with the life of his nearest & dearest, and goes out for revenge. Even I saw the reveal at the end coming way-off (I rarely do), but I still really enjoyed this film.I thought it was very well plotted and paced; Vin Diesel played it gruff, but mostly low-key (no huge sobbing moments, or tearful walks on the beach, which was refreshing). His character, along with that of his friend, were fleshed out into more-rounded human beings than the usual action hero & sidekick. The enemies were straight out of 'the Big Book Of Drug Dealers and Cartel lackeys', but Timothy Oliphant was amusing and well played, as ever (also a great turn in The Good Girl).And I found the violence viscerally satisfying & gritty, without being seriously glorified, or venturing (too far) into Bad Boys style Hollywood explosions, helicopter gunships, LA car chases etc.Most surprising of all (to me) is that Vin agreed to grow his hair out a little - as you would in an extended hospital stay - and roughen up his otherwise clean shaven / macho male model looks. Wandering around with the goatee, he reminded me more of the guy out of Cypress Hill.Kudos also goes to the ending. It could have finished two scenes earlier than it did, but the tying up of loose ends wasn't done in an overly sentimental or triumphant way, which was similarly refreshing.Good screenplay, good acting (in a pretty standard film like this), and mostly avoiding the really obvious clichés of plot & character. I really enjoyed it. On the scale of revenge movies - it's not as good as Mel Gibson's remake of Payback, or The Rock in the remake of Walking Tall. But it would hold its own alongside them in a collector's box set.

Lately, i do not watch too many old-fashioned' action films like this. This has mostly to do with the fact that action films are somehow always the same. The only things that can make an action film decent are not too many corny scenes and some comedic elements. Take for instance Cradle 2 the Grave, which I saw a couple of weeks back. Now the action was pretty OK, there were some funny elements, but there were some stupid things as well (such as a corny ending). Or Bulletproof Monk, which was a bit corny overall. While A Man Apart is certainly not a good film, it is one of the better old school' action films I've seen lately. The acting is decent, there are no corny elements and there is a good mix of emotion / softness and action. The film might not be suited for the big screen, but it does well as a rental (BTW: the film was shot between 2000 and 2001 and got shelved at first). The film certainly has some interesting elements and is better than most of Seagal's or Van Damme's new films. I was not disappointed to have rented it.
6,75 out of 10

A Man Apart is nothing special but after the first 15 minutes I didn't think I'd be saying that in my comment. It starts off really well, exciting, good characters and it was moving along nice and quickly. While the good characters and the moving along kept up throughout the movie, the most important thing didn't - the excitement. The action sequences just became like Vin Diesel's acting voice - exactly the same the whole movie. The director tried his best to vary it (bombs, choking .etc) but these things never seemed to have any effect, for what reason I don't know. Also the storyline was unbelievably predictable.There are a lot of action movie out there, a lot - you're not going to find anything new in this one.

Vin Diesel is MUCH better in this drama/action film then he was in his last action film, "XXX". His performance as a broken man who just lost his wife to drug dealer, & his violent crusade against said criminals, while not original in the least, does captivate you. As far as action movies go, this one can hang with the better of them. The action doesn't mix too well with the drama though...My Grade: B-Eye Candy: 2 topless women, 1 erotic dancer (Former Man Show Juggy, Paula Harrison) in see-through clothExtras: 7 Deleted Scenes (the first having 1 more topless chick, the 7th being an extended version of the aforementioned Juggy's dance) ; Trailers for (of all things)Run, Ronnie, Run & Highwaymen

This movie is alright for a gritty action film because it reminds me of the grittiness of Narc with the action sequences of XXX.  The acting of Vin Diesel as a DEA agent is going out for revenge after his wife was murdered is good and alright and the acting Larenz Tate as his partner is alright as well.Overall, I find this movie a good gritty action flick to entertain yourself any time.

I personally liked the film. Vin Diesel's performance was the right side of credible. Lerenz Tate was a good choice as a partner, as he provides a solid performance as well and provided the comic relief this sort of film needs. The plot wasn't as lightweight as I thought it was doing to be, the script didn't go too over the top (although there was some moments) and the action was pretty impressive. Not too bad for a Vin Diesel vehicle.My one problem though is that the ending didn't make sense (why did everyone start fighting when he was walking off at the end?)Frankly, I think it would have been better if they had swapped the end scene with the previous scene at the wife's graveside.Also, did the makers of 'The Punisher' watch this film beforehand, because they are very similar.

A action/thriller/drama/crime about a cop named Sean Vetter(Vin diesel,The Fast And The Furious) who takes down the biggest drug cartel in northern Mexico.But now there is a new cartel on the block the leaders name is diablo and to show how tough he is he tries to kill Sean Vetter he doesn't succeed with that but he does kill Vetter's wife.Now Sean Vetter is out to find and kill the person who had his wife killed.Vin Diesel(Sean Vetter) gave a pretty good performance.Actually there wasn't any bad acting in the whole movie.The storyline was a little sketchy at times."A Man Apart" didn't quite reach the directing medium.The screenplay also was a little sketchy at times but not extremely bad at all.This is a great movie if you are looking for a shootumup action packed Vin Diesel movie but if you are looking for something with a deep storyline this definitely is not the movie you want to see.Best actor/actress-Vin DieselClassic Vin Diesel movie-Jake HydenI rated this movie a 6 out of 10Rated-(R) for strong graphic violence, language, drug content and sexuality.6/10

When I rate a movie or give my opinion of a movie, I try my best to compare it to other movies like it. For example, if it is a drama about family, I use other dramas about families as a benchmark. "A Man Apart" is definitely a vigilante film. Sean Vetter's (Vin Diesel) wife was murdered and he is out to find the killer. If you want a reference for a vigilante film, see just about any Charles Bronson movie, or some of the movies with Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwazzenegger, or Steven Segal. One of my personal favorite vigilante movies is the Denzel Washington starred "Man on Fire".Comparatively, "A Man Apart" doesn't quite match up. Whether it was how the movie was done, or it was Vin Diesel, I didn't quite feel the pain of Sean when he lost his wife. This type of movie is dependent upon the drive of the main character and getting the audience to understand or feel that same drive. Sure, most of us would understand a man seeking revenge or justice for the wrongful death of his wife, but the character still has to have some type of charisma or believability. Vin Diesel is too one dimensional to show a wide range of emotions, and there weren't enough scenes showing the bond between Sean and his wife for me to be too upset when she was killed. In the end, the movie was about a vigilante seeking justice who I wanted to succeed, but I was still indifferent about.

A Man Apart is seemingly one of Vin Diesel's lesser known films, and for good reason, as the film is quite more aggressive and heavy R-rated than his typical action fare films (Fast & Furious franchise, xXx franchise, Riddick franchise). However, this film is quite better than expected and better than most critics rate it. For this type of film, we know what to expect given the subject matter and rating. And in the end, the hardcore violence, strong language and overall dark tone works well.Vin Diesel's charisma and performance as the lead is what makes this film much more enjoyable than it should be. He carries the film and makes it and enjoyable watch. His overall look and aggressive nature in this film shows somewhat more range, which this is one of his better and more underrated performance. And we wonder as to why he has not done more R rated films like this in his career.Comparison's to Training Day somewhat, though that film was better, A Man Apart brings enough energy and decent action sequences, making this film worth a watch.A highly entertaining shootout around in the latter part of the film taken place during a parking lot is a highlight of the film. Given it's premise which has been done many times before, it delivers for the action crowd. As a rewatch 05/04/21' A Man Apart remains one of Vin Diesel's more under appreciated films and we don't get this aggression from him anymore. The plot may have been done before but he carries the film and its worth watching for his performance.

I watched this movie a few days ago, i have to admit it's different from Vin's other movies, the story did not make much sense in some parts,it felt a little overcooked in others., and slow paced in the middle. While the movie had the explosions, gun fights and car chases, I felt that it was not about the violence/revenge as much as it was about Vin's character mourning his wife's death and choosing to do so in anger, it was his way of screaming, letting the world hear his pain.The thing that really effected me is the relationship between Sean and Stacey, the connection they had, even though we did not see much in the beginning of the movie, i felt that they had a strong bond. The acting - in between the violent scenes is not half bad, specially Vin's scene at the hospital, it's heart breaking. It is a good start for Vin in to do more " human " normal everyday roles, we have to respect the guy for that.

This movie was so intense that even though my friends were trying to lure me away from the screen, I just couldn't. I was locked on to the movie screen, watching everything that went on. Vin Diesel did a terrific job as the main role in this movie. He showed intensity, emotion, fear, jealousy, and heart through-out the whole picture, it was just inspiration. The movie starts out with a special police force designed to be cops that looked like they hated cops at the same time, to break into a party of drug dealers and stop the corporation. Their mission was successful while entertaining. After, Sean Vetter (Vin Diesel) and his wife Stacy (Jacqueline Obradors) throw a celebration party at their beach house. The party ends, and we see them asleep in their beds. We hear movement outside of the sliding glass door by the bedroom, Sean wakes up, opening his eyes once the door is silently open. "GET DOWN!" yells Sean to his wife as the two men at the door pull out their guns and start to fire. Sean grabs his pistol and tries to shoot them both down, as he is shot in the ribs. He runs outside after them, and shoots one of them down before he can escape. Sean walks over to him, yelling at him about coming into his house, as he shoots him once again while he is already down on the ground. He asks who he is, demanding an answer. The only thing the man says is, "You will never stop Diablo." and then dies. Sean runs back into his bedroom telling his wife to call 911. She is still lying on the ground. He picks her up and puts her on the bed. He then asks if she's ok, and she keeps repeating over and over, "I'm ok....I'm ok" Sean dials 911 on his cell phone and when a woman answers, he doesn't even speak, because he is watching his wife die in his arms. The woman on the phone keeps saying, "I can't hear you sir, please speak up." but Sean doesn't, then the screen turns completely white. This is only the beginning of this almost 2 hour picture. Through-out the rest, Sean is determined to find this so called Diablo and finish him off. I gave this movie a 10, and I rarely do that, but it deserves that rating. I enjoyed sitting and watching it, as it moved from scene to scene. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

I still remember seeing the Cool poster of "A Man Apart" at bus stops way back in early 2000's when Vin Diesel was getting bigger & becoming the next big Action star, the poster promised a troubled tough Cop who is gonna turn vigilante & take out cartels!!! The movie is excellent old school 90's style Action like the type of violent Action Thriller that Schwarzenegger or Stallone would've made back then & Vin Diesel lives up to the Action Hero hype.I brought "A Man Apart" on video as soon as it was released & i loved it, the tone & flow of the story is very old school 90's & i grew up on all those Action films so i felt as sense of comfort & Nostalgia while watching this excellent film.
Basic Action Thriller plot is Vin Diesel plays a tough as hell undercover DEA Agent named Sean Vetter who turns vigilante when his wife is murdered & vows to take down a crime lord known as Diablo, that's the simple old school action plot & Vin Diesel gives a tough emotional & angry performance & i still think it's his best piece of dramatic acting he's done!!!
Diesel is helped by friend & partner Hicks played by underrated but great actor Larenz Tate who is such a good intense actor who you will remember from "Menace 2 Society" so there's good solid performances here by these two good actors.The Action is brutal violent & gritty & is not just a Cop type Thriller but also abit of a Hood drama too as well as an old school Action film, this is a revenge film with some great Action scenes.
"A Man Apart" is still my personal favourite Vin Diesel film & i also love the underrated Mob Drama "Knockaround Guys" & the Excellent sci-fi Cult Classic "Pitch Black" as these were the first Diesel films i ever saw as he first came out & was rising to become the Action star he is now!!!
I checked out his breakout hit film "Triple X or XXX" & it was a good solid Action Thriller but got nothing on his "A Man Apart" & i didn't like his "Fast & Furious franchise" but all in all Vin Diesel is a great Action Star."A Man Apart" is a solid tough gritty Action Thriller with plenty of shootouts & fights & a great troubled & intense performance by Vin Diesel himself.

Strictly by the numbers action piece in the vengeful cop genre. Diesel is an ex-gang thug who now works a cop. After taking down a big crime boss, his wife gets murdered and Diesel goes out looking for whoever did it.This is one of the things that bothers me. Diesel doesn't really know who's behind the hit (nor does the audience), so what follows is basically watching Diesel going round asking questions, seemingly at random, stumbling upon clues that make little sense. It's like the screenplay wasn't quite finished, so they made up scenes as they went along. The result is long stretches of pointless talking, with random shootouts every now and then.There's nothing spectacular about anything that happens, or concerning the film's look in general. Moreover, it's hard to sympathize with Diesel's character when he himself doesn't seem to care about the safety of those around him. The films mixes violent action scenes with broad comedy in a way that simply doesn't work.The story just unfolds without explaining what's going on. The ending, for example, just happens, and doesn't feel like it belongs to the rest of the film at all. Diesel's acting skills come up short, as does most others as well to be fair. Only Timothy Oliphant seems to be having a good time, and he's really the only thing worth watching. [1/10]

Vin Diesel tries his best to emote in this ultimately routine crime / revenge saga. He plays Sean Vetter, a former gangbanger turned DEA agent. The persistence of Sean and his colleagues over the course of seven years finally pays off, as they successfully apprehend a drug kingpin, Memo Lucero (Geno Silva). The consequence of this episode is that soon Seans' beloved wife Stacy (Jacqueline Obradors) is killed in an assault on Seans' house. Once he's recuperated, Sean is hellbent on finding out just who gave the order to attempt murder, if it wasn't Lucero. All he knows is that a mysterious figure named El Diablo has taken Memos' place and is even more evil and ruthless than Memo.Larenz Tate plays Seans' friend Demetrius Hicks, who must make a decision between being loyal to Sean and letting the law handle things. Ms. Obradors is an absolutely gorgeous and appealing presence here, and she and Diesel do make a believable couple. Silva delivers a creditable performance as the low key crime boss, with whom Sean actually makes a connection when Luceros' wife falls victim to El Diablo. There's other notable talent in the cast: Timothy Olyphant, Steve Eastin, Juan Fernandez, Jeff Kober, Marco Rodriguez, Mike Moroff, Ken Davitian. The filmmaking is reasonably slick, with the soundtrack full of hip hop and rock, and the action scenes are high energy stuff. But it's hard to get all that interested in this tale when everything just feels so familiar and predictable, not to mention senseless.As this viewer already said, Diesel gives a reasonable effort as the tormented and enraged lead character, but he's simply outshone by his supporting cast.Watchable enough for 110 minutes but pretty forgettable.Six out of 10.

***SPOILERS INCLUDED***I expected to be totally disgusted with this movie.  Ever since Pitch Black, Vin Diesel has really disappointed, and proved to me that he was trying to be the next Sly Stallone or Arnold, someone who would just get a lot of money for showing his body without really acting.  His acting in this was okay, a little better that I expected, and the movie wasn't bad.  The ending needs a lot of work though.  It had me intrigued throughout, although I personally thought that Diesel and Co was pretty stupid for partying out in the open after taking down a MAJOR drug cartel.  Why didn't they go underground for a while to make sure things blow over?  Anyway, Diesel was tolerable, he did the role justice, because he actually had to show emotion in this.  Larenz Tate shows up after a lengthy absence, he doesn't do much for me, but he did what he could.  The ending was a real let-down, but A Man Apart is tolerable.  Not a terrible film.** out of **** stars

Sean Vetter is a DEA agent who arrests Memo Lucero, the leader of a Mexican cartel during a cross-border operation conducted in conjunction with the Mexican authorities. It is considered a victory but soon another, more ruthless, gangster known only as 'Diablo' is taking over the business of smuggling cocaine into California. At the same time an attempt is made on Vetter's life; he is hospitalised but his wife is killed. He is determined to find the man responsible. At first he suspects Lucero's associates but when his wife and child are murdered it appears that they have a common enemy. Vetter and his friend, and fellow agent, Demetrius Hicks set about trying to find Diablo; starting near the bottom of the drug business and working their way up. Inevitably there will be setbacks along the say.This might not be Vin Diesel's best film but it is entertaining. It has plenty of solid action and a modicum of humour as well as some genuinely emotional moments. The story itself is hardly original but if you want a revenge story the killing of a spouse or child is the obvious way to go. The acting is solid; notably from Vin Diesel who shows he can do emotion as well as action. While his character dominates Larenz Tate's Hicks impresses too; I initially feared he was being set up to be the 'comedy sidekick' but thankfully it turned out he was there to provide an anchor when Vetter's emotions get the better of him. Overall I'd say this is worth a watch if you want some action that doesn't go over the top.

It is not clear "who" arranged the hit on Sean; was it Memo or Mateo. Sean asks both; Memo responds in jail "if I wanted you dead, you would be". Mateo responds "you think it was me" implying that it was Memo.Hollywood Jack knew of the hit and relayed this when he took out the guy in echo park, so this supports Mateo being behind the hit. Also during the botched deal, Joe's partner says "I'm the one that took care of the cop's stupid b*&#% wife"---also implying Mateo.The ultimate question is who was behind the phone call to the guy at the bar in San Pedro ordering the hit. It was either Memo while in custody or Mateo.What facts would support Memo being behind the hit?

A fairly middling revenge thriller, starring new action hero Vin Diesel. Diesel is actually one of the most interesting things in this production, as he's called to emote and act like never before, and he actually holds up pretty well in the performance. It's a shame about the rest of the interchangeable cast, a bunch who put in shouty, show-offy performances and don't engage the viewer's interest whatsoever.The plot is complex and muddled, involving an imprisoned drugs baron and his new rival on the market, and little more than an excuse for some strong violence. The action, when it comes, is very impressive, including the massive shoot-out about halfway through the movie. Sadly, things become even more muddled towards the end, with a head-scratching twist and a real anti-climax of a conclusion. The biggest disappointment is in the director F. Gary Gray, who brought us the wonderful THE NEGOTIATOR. This one doesn't even come close. The film is dark, blurred and often seems to be filmed with a shaky camera, leaving the viewer straining to make out what's going on, and straining to hear the gruff voices of the cast over the incessant, headache-inducing music.

A Man Apart is a prime example of how a studio can mess up a film. Early reports of the film had it a bit heavy on the drama and not so much on the action. F. Gary Gray did a good direction job and the acting by Vin Diesel and Larenz Tate is good as usual but the film is full of bad editing and the pacing is off. Worth a look though if you're a hard core Diesel fan.

Ok performances, adequate to poor directing, a frequently nonsensical script, inconsistent cinematography, and ambitions that far outreach the filmmakers grasp. This film is passable entertainment for the hardcore action crowd but it offers nothing new and nothing that is really good. The promise that Vin Diesel showed in Boiler Room and other earlier pictures is being wasted in unremarkable films like this.

I just sat down tonight and finally watched a movie that I have been wanting to watch since the day I saw the trailer back in 2003. I don't know why, but ever since then I've been wanting to see this movie and tonight I finally saw it. It was different than I thought it would be, I saw it as a "Four Brothers" feel, but Vincent just made it a unique and action packed movie with a couple "saw it coming" twists. I love Vin's acting and there were no superhero moments, no fake CGI scenes, or any "Mission Impossible" crap. It was all true to life, real, and it made you feel a lot for the main character, Sean. You're in his shoes, you're following in his footsteps and you know the pain this man was going thru the entire movie."You got no mud flaps on your car..."

Vin Diesel plays DEA agent Sean Vetter sent to Mexico to help arrest the leader of the largest drug cartel supplying the US. His name is Memo Lucero. After Lucero is arrested, Vetter and his fellow officers celebrate at his beach side home. That night, Vetter and his wife are shot; she is killed, and her burial takes place while Vetter is in the hospital recovering. It turns out that a new guy is rising to take the place Lucero left empty when he was jailed. El Diablo is the one responsible for the hit on Vetter and his wife, and the rest of the film is spent chasing down El Diablo. In another comment, Memo Lucero is consistently incorrectly called Ramon Cadena. Other than that, I agree... the film is full of bad clichés... cop goes renegade after the murder of his significant other, but can't really get anything accomplished until the top cops take his gun and badge. It's incredibly formulaic. That said, I've seen worse, and it's a decent diversion.

And the title of the comment says it all. Vin Diesel is in that part of his career where he is given every kind of roles, just to check out on which one he does better. Well, it surely isn't on this thriller attempt flick, just because it fails in just about every possible aspect. The good cop, sees his wife die, and promisses to revenge her death against the bad guys who just happen to be running a drug cartel. Well, you can't get more original than that! 15 minutes into the movie, when you start figuring everything beforehand when you're not supposed to, than that's a really bad sign. F Gary Gray's direction ads absolutely nothing to the movie: it lacks emotion, depth and thrills. and Vin Diesel isn't really helping himself very much, because we liked him in those guilty pleasure kind of movies that were the Fast and the Furious, merely because of the car chases. But if the panorama doesn't change fast enough, than Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris know they have their inheritance assured.

The start of the movie is good and gripping and it gives you the feel of a good movie in making but after 20-25 minutes the movie start loosing the plot. The movie misleads in between and after a point of time it will feel boring. Action is good, Vin diesel is as good as always. The movie could have been better provided with a good screenplay.

A Man Apart is seemingly one of Vin Diesel's lesser known films, and for good reason, as the film is quite more aggressive and heavy R-rated than his typical action fare films (Fast & Furious franchise, xXx franchise, Riddick franchise). However, this film is quite better than expected and better than most critics rate it. For this type of film, we know what to expect given the subject matter and rating. And in the end, the hardcore violence, strong language and overall dark tone works well.Vin Diesel's charisma and performance as the lead is what makes this film much more enjoyable than it should be. He carries the film and makes it and enjoyable watch. His overall look and aggressive nature in this film shows somewhat more range, which this is one of his better and more underrated performance. And we wonder as to why he has not done more R rated films like this in his career.Comparison's to Training Day somewhat, though that film was better, A Man Apart brings enough energy and decent action sequences, making this film worth a watch.A highly entertaining shootout around in the latter part of the film taken place during a parking lot is a highlight of the film. Given it's premise which has been done many times before, it delivers for the action crowd. As a rewatch 05/04/21' A Man Apart remains one of Vin Diesel's more under appreciated films and we don't get this aggression from him anymore. The plot may have been done before but he carries the film and its worth watching for his performance.

I watched this movie a few days ago, i have to admit it's different from Vin's other movies, the story did not make much sense in some parts,it felt a little overcooked in others., and slow paced in the middle. While the movie had the explosions, gun fights and car chases, I felt that it was not about the violence/revenge as much as it was about Vin's character mourning his wife's death and choosing to do so in anger, it was his way of screaming, letting the world hear his pain.The thing that really effected me is the relationship between Sean and Stacey, the connection they had, even though we did not see much in the beginning of the movie, i felt that they had a strong bond. The acting - in between the violent scenes is not half bad, specially Vin's scene at the hospital, it's heart breaking. It is a good start for Vin in to do more " human " normal everyday roles, we have to respect the guy for that.

This movie was so intense that even though my friends were trying to lure me away from the screen, I just couldn't. I was locked on to the movie screen, watching everything that went on. Vin Diesel did a terrific job as the main role in this movie. He showed intensity, emotion, fear, jealousy, and heart through-out the whole picture, it was just inspiration. The movie starts out with a special police force designed to be cops that looked like they hated cops at the same time, to break into a party of drug dealers and stop the corporation. Their mission was successful while entertaining. After, Sean Vetter (Vin Diesel) and his wife Stacy (Jacqueline Obradors) throw a celebration party at their beach house. The party ends, and we see them asleep in their beds. We hear movement outside of the sliding glass door by the bedroom, Sean wakes up, opening his eyes once the door is silently open. "GET DOWN!" yells Sean to his wife as the two men at the door pull out their guns and start to fire. Sean grabs his pistol and tries to shoot them both down, as he is shot in the ribs. He runs outside after them, and shoots one of them down before he can escape. Sean walks over to him, yelling at him about coming into his house, as he shoots him once again while he is already down on the ground. He asks who he is, demanding an answer. The only thing the man says is, "You will never stop Diablo." and then dies. Sean runs back into his bedroom telling his wife to call 911. She is still lying on the ground. He picks her up and puts her on the bed. He then asks if she's ok, and she keeps repeating over and over, "I'm ok....I'm ok" Sean dials 911 on his cell phone and when a woman answers, he doesn't even speak, because he is watching his wife die in his arms. The woman on the phone keeps saying, "I can't hear you sir, please speak up." but Sean doesn't, then the screen turns completely white. This is only the beginning of this almost 2 hour picture. Through-out the rest, Sean is determined to find this so called Diablo and finish him off. I gave this movie a 10, and I rarely do that, but it deserves that rating. I enjoyed sitting and watching it, as it moved from scene to scene. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

I still remember seeing the Cool poster of "A Man Apart" at bus stops way back in early 2000's when Vin Diesel was getting bigger & becoming the next big Action star, the poster promised a troubled tough Cop who is gonna turn vigilante & take out cartels!!! The movie is excellent old school 90's style Action like the type of violent Action Thriller that Schwarzenegger or Stallone would've made back then & Vin Diesel lives up to the Action Hero hype.I brought "A Man Apart" on video as soon as it was released & i loved it, the tone & flow of the story is very old school 90's & i grew up on all those Action films so i felt as sense of comfort & Nostalgia while watching this excellent film.
Basic Action Thriller plot is Vin Diesel plays a tough as hell undercover DEA Agent named Sean Vetter who turns vigilante when his wife is murdered & vows to take down a crime lord known as Diablo, that's the simple old school action plot & Vin Diesel gives a tough emotional & angry performance & i still think it's his best piece of dramatic acting he's done!!!
Diesel is helped by friend & partner Hicks played by underrated but great actor Larenz Tate who is such a good intense actor who you will remember from "Menace 2 Society" so there's good solid performances here by these two good actors.The Action is brutal violent & gritty & is not just a Cop type Thriller but also abit of a Hood drama too as well as an old school Action film, this is a revenge film with some great Action scenes.
"A Man Apart" is still my personal favourite Vin Diesel film & i also love the underrated Mob Drama "Knockaround Guys" & the Excellent sci-fi Cult Classic "Pitch Black" as these were the first Diesel films i ever saw as he first came out & was rising to become the Action star he is now!!!
I checked out his breakout hit film "Triple X or XXX" & it was a good solid Action Thriller but got nothing on his "A Man Apart" & i didn't like his "Fast & Furious franchise" but all in all Vin Diesel is a great Action Star."A Man Apart" is a solid tough gritty Action Thriller with plenty of shootouts & fights & a great troubled & intense performance by Vin Diesel himself.

Strictly by the numbers action piece in the vengeful cop genre. Diesel is an ex-gang thug who now works a cop. After taking down a big crime boss, his wife gets murdered and Diesel goes out looking for whoever did it.This is one of the things that bothers me. Diesel doesn't really know who's behind the hit (nor does the audience), so what follows is basically watching Diesel going round asking questions, seemingly at random, stumbling upon clues that make little sense. It's like the screenplay wasn't quite finished, so they made up scenes as they went along. The result is long stretches of pointless talking, with random shootouts every now and then.There's nothing spectacular about anything that happens, or concerning the film's look in general. Moreover, it's hard to sympathize with Diesel's character when he himself doesn't seem to care about the safety of those around him. The films mixes violent action scenes with broad comedy in a way that simply doesn't work.The story just unfolds without explaining what's going on. The ending, for example, just happens, and doesn't feel like it belongs to the rest of the film at all. Diesel's acting skills come up short, as does most others as well to be fair. Only Timothy Oliphant seems to be having a good time, and he's really the only thing worth watching. [1/10]

Sean Vetter is a DEA agent who arrests Memo Lucero, the leader of a Mexican cartel during a cross-border operation conducted in conjunction with the Mexican authorities. It is considered a victory but soon another, more ruthless, gangster known only as 'Diablo' is taking over the business of smuggling cocaine into California. At the same time an attempt is made on Vetter's life; he is hospitalised but his wife is killed. He is determined to find the man responsible. At first he suspects Lucero's associates but when his wife and child are murdered it appears that they have a common enemy. Vetter and his friend, and fellow agent, Demetrius Hicks set about trying to find Diablo; starting near the bottom of the drug business and working their way up. Inevitably there will be setbacks along the say.This might not be Vin Diesel's best film but it is entertaining. It has plenty of solid action and a modicum of humour as well as some genuinely emotional moments. The story itself is hardly original but if you want a revenge story the killing of a spouse or child is the obvious way to go. The acting is solid; notably from Vin Diesel who shows he can do emotion as well as action. While his character dominates Larenz Tate's Hicks impresses too; I initially feared he was being set up to be the 'comedy sidekick' but thankfully it turned out he was there to provide an anchor when Vetter's emotions get the better of him. Overall I'd say this is worth a watch if you want some action that doesn't go over the top.

***SPOILERS INCLUDED***I expected to be totally disgusted with this movie.  Ever since Pitch Black, Vin Diesel has really disappointed, and proved to me that he was trying to be the next Sly Stallone or Arnold, someone who would just get a lot of money for showing his body without really acting.  His acting in this was okay, a little better that I expected, and the movie wasn't bad.  The ending needs a lot of work though.  It had me intrigued throughout, although I personally thought that Diesel and Co was pretty stupid for partying out in the open after taking down a MAJOR drug cartel.  Why didn't they go underground for a while to make sure things blow over?  Anyway, Diesel was tolerable, he did the role justice, because he actually had to show emotion in this.  Larenz Tate shows up after a lengthy absence, he doesn't do much for me, but he did what he could.  The ending was a real let-down, but A Man Apart is tolerable.  Not a terrible film.** out of **** stars

Vin Diesel tries his best to emote in this ultimately routine crime / revenge saga. He plays Sean Vetter, a former gangbanger turned DEA agent. The persistence of Sean and his colleagues over the course of seven years finally pays off, as they successfully apprehend a drug kingpin, Memo Lucero (Geno Silva). The consequence of this episode is that soon Seans' beloved wife Stacy (Jacqueline Obradors) is killed in an assault on Seans' house. Once he's recuperated, Sean is hellbent on finding out just who gave the order to attempt murder, if it wasn't Lucero. All he knows is that a mysterious figure named El Diablo has taken Memos' place and is even more evil and ruthless than Memo.Larenz Tate plays Seans' friend Demetrius Hicks, who must make a decision between being loyal to Sean and letting the law handle things. Ms. Obradors is an absolutely gorgeous and appealing presence here, and she and Diesel do make a believable couple. Silva delivers a creditable performance as the low key crime boss, with whom Sean actually makes a connection when Luceros' wife falls victim to El Diablo. There's other notable talent in the cast: Timothy Olyphant, Steve Eastin, Juan Fernandez, Jeff Kober, Marco Rodriguez, Mike Moroff, Ken Davitian. The filmmaking is reasonably slick, with the soundtrack full of hip hop and rock, and the action scenes are high energy stuff. But it's hard to get all that interested in this tale when everything just feels so familiar and predictable, not to mention senseless.As this viewer already said, Diesel gives a reasonable effort as the tormented and enraged lead character, but he's simply outshone by his supporting cast.Watchable enough for 110 minutes but pretty forgettable.Six out of 10.

It is not clear "who" arranged the hit on Sean; was it Memo or Mateo. Sean asks both; Memo responds in jail "if I wanted you dead, you would be". Mateo responds "you think it was me" implying that it was Memo.Hollywood Jack knew of the hit and relayed this when he took out the guy in echo park, so this supports Mateo being behind the hit. Also during the botched deal, Joe's partner says "I'm the one that took care of the cop's stupid b*&#% wife"---also implying Mateo.The ultimate question is who was behind the phone call to the guy at the bar in San Pedro ordering the hit. It was either Memo while in custody or Mateo.What facts would support Memo being behind the hit?

A fairly middling revenge thriller, starring new action hero Vin Diesel. Diesel is actually one of the most interesting things in this production, as he's called to emote and act like never before, and he actually holds up pretty well in the performance. It's a shame about the rest of the interchangeable cast, a bunch who put in shouty, show-offy performances and don't engage the viewer's interest whatsoever.The plot is complex and muddled, involving an imprisoned drugs baron and his new rival on the market, and little more than an excuse for some strong violence. The action, when it comes, is very impressive, including the massive shoot-out about halfway through the movie. Sadly, things become even more muddled towards the end, with a head-scratching twist and a real anti-climax of a conclusion. The biggest disappointment is in the director F. Gary Gray, who brought us the wonderful THE NEGOTIATOR. This one doesn't even come close. The film is dark, blurred and often seems to be filmed with a shaky camera, leaving the viewer straining to make out what's going on, and straining to hear the gruff voices of the cast over the incessant, headache-inducing music.

A Man Apart is a prime example of how a studio can mess up a film. Early reports of the film had it a bit heavy on the drama and not so much on the action. F. Gary Gray did a good direction job and the acting by Vin Diesel and Larenz Tate is good as usual but the film is full of bad editing and the pacing is off. Worth a look though if you're a hard core Diesel fan.

Ok performances, adequate to poor directing, a frequently nonsensical script, inconsistent cinematography, and ambitions that far outreach the filmmakers grasp. This film is passable entertainment for the hardcore action crowd but it offers nothing new and nothing that is really good. The promise that Vin Diesel showed in Boiler Room and other earlier pictures is being wasted in unremarkable films like this.

I just sat down tonight and finally watched a movie that I have been wanting to watch since the day I saw the trailer back in 2003. I don't know why, but ever since then I've been wanting to see this movie and tonight I finally saw it. It was different than I thought it would be, I saw it as a "Four Brothers" feel, but Vincent just made it a unique and action packed movie with a couple "saw it coming" twists. I love Vin's acting and there were no superhero moments, no fake CGI scenes, or any "Mission Impossible" crap. It was all true to life, real, and it made you feel a lot for the main character, Sean. You're in his shoes, you're following in his footsteps and you know the pain this man was going thru the entire movie."You got no mud flaps on your car..."

Vin Diesel plays DEA agent Sean Vetter sent to Mexico to help arrest the leader of the largest drug cartel supplying the US. His name is Memo Lucero. After Lucero is arrested, Vetter and his fellow officers celebrate at his beach side home. That night, Vetter and his wife are shot; she is killed, and her burial takes place while Vetter is in the hospital recovering. It turns out that a new guy is rising to take the place Lucero left empty when he was jailed. El Diablo is the one responsible for the hit on Vetter and his wife, and the rest of the film is spent chasing down El Diablo. In another comment, Memo Lucero is consistently incorrectly called Ramon Cadena. Other than that, I agree... the film is full of bad clichés... cop goes renegade after the murder of his significant other, but can't really get anything accomplished until the top cops take his gun and badge. It's incredibly formulaic. That said, I've seen worse, and it's a decent diversion.

this movie is as predictable as it gets. Sure you get good action and shootings there, but both the story and the characters couldn't be more transparent. I was expecting at least quite decent action movie since Vin Diesel is in it but his character is kinda flat, and to be honest I don't blame him, he hasn't been given much to work on. I suppose the only thing he could have done differently was not accepting that role... The only role that raises above average is Larenz Tate's, he really should get a credit for that. Sadly there is no "good" villain in that movie. Timothy Olyphant's role was promising but failed to keep that promise. all in all, if you have nothing else to do, you can watch that movie. But if you have a choice, choose something else.
