In Philadelphia, the irresponsible and selfish Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is a drunken easy woman having sex with many men. Her sister Rose (Toni Collette) is the opposite, responsible lawyer but needy and having complex, compulsively buying shoes to relief her frustrations. Maggie is expelled from her father home by her stepmother, and Rose lodges her sister in her apartment. When Maggie has one night stand with Rose's boyfriend, Rose sends her sister away. She finds letters and postcards from her missing grandmother Ella Hirsch (Shirley MacLaine) that she believed had died that lives in a retirement compound in Florida hidden in her father's drawer, and without any option, she decides to travel to meet Ella. With Ella, Maggie changes, becoming another woman and improving the relationships in her family."In Her Shoes" is a feel-good comedy with an excellent lead trio of actresses. The story about sisterhood and parenthood is bitter sweet, alternating funny and dramatic moments and with a nice conclusion. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Em Seu Lugar" ("In Your Place")

Enjoyable but slightly flawed, In Her Shoes is definitely deeper than a chick-flick in the handling of the characters. Toni Collette is excellent as usual, as well as Shirley MacLaine, yet I couldn't help thinking while watching that I should read the book it was based on and get a deeper look at these people and their lives. I felt the film could have gone into more detail and I expected it to be longer, as so many plot developments felt somewhat simplified to fit them all in to a 2-hour running time. That's my biggest criticism of the film, but it was enjoyable in general and I had a wonderful time watching. A few other things I enjoyed: the Rocky reference (my favorite), and the opening sequence during the credits. I have to credit this last one to both screenwriter and director for this incredible opening, which in completely visual terms sets up the film's themes. The titles are presented in cuts between the two sisters, highlighting both their conflict and their connection to one another. Generally, it has a nice balance between dead-seriousness and light drama, but I wish there was more of it to comment on.

I had apprehension about "In Her Shoes" because Cameron Diaz has been in so many movies where she plays just a fluff of a character. But not here, where she is Maggie Feller, who we learn very early just doesn't seem able to hold down a job, uses SEX to her advantage, and usually ends up crashing with a friend or relative for as long as they will tolerate her. Toni Collette plays her very different sister Rose Feller, an attorney in Philadelphia who acts and looks a bit homely, and who marvels that she might be able to attract a really nice guy. After one too many screw ups, Rose kicks Maggie out, about the time Maggie finds out that not only is her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) alive, she is living in Florida in a retirement community. (Mom had died when Maggie was very small, and her dad "shielded" her from grandma.)Much of the story is Maggie and Grandma coming to an understanding, and Maggie figuring life out for herself there.SPOILERS. One reason Maggie had problem was her undiagnosed and untreated dyslexia. Grandma found her looking for cash, and made a deal with her. If she got a job, Grandma would match her salary dollar for dollar, so that Maggie could save up $3Grand to go to New York to make it as an actress. Doing hospital duty, Maggie met an older man who insisted she read to him. A retired professor, he helped Maggie face her dyslexia and learn to deal with it.

CHICK FLICK! Chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick fliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick! What else could you possibly expect from a movie about sisters that involves shoes and a search for their grandmother? That's all you need to know. You either like the genre, you don't like the genre, or your girl forces you to watch the genre with her. Accept which one applies to you and go with it. If you're chickflicktose intolerant then this obviously isn't for you.That being sad, I must admit that thanks to good character and relationship development, good acting, and believable characters set within a believable story, I enjoyed it. Granted, Cameron Diaz's long legs might have had something to do with enhancing my enjoyment, but I was entertained nonetheless.Things start off a little slow as the relationship between the sisters is allowed to grow, but once Maggie finds herself in Florida, working at an old folks' home, the story and laughs start to pick up. There's one old woman who is particularly funny. I don't know her name (you'll recognize her by the fact that she's in a wheelchair most of the time), but she reminded me of my grandmother, commenting on how Diaz "puts a postage stamp on her bottom and calls it a swimsuit" and acting shocked that there are now pants that exist with "'juicy' written across the hiney." How can you not be entertained by a crotchety old woman's outlook on how the times have a-changed? If reading comprehension has got you down and you're still struggling with whether or not you want to see this, let me break it down even further. This is a story about the love between sisters. They fight, they drift apart, they find out their grandmother is still alive, and they make their way back to each other. All sorts of lessons on love, self-discovery, romance, and who owns whose heart are explored. There's even some sappy poetry reading thrown in for good measure. I know that this all sounds like a huge shot of estrogen, but thankfully, things never get as syrupy as you might expect.That doesn't mean there's any shortage of attempts to strain a tear out of the female (and non-manly) eyes. I almost missed out on some dialogue thanks to the sniffling of the four ladies sitting in front of me. So gals, bring your tissues. Guys, if your gal brings you along then bring the sewing kit. You'll need to sew 'em back on after this one. All right, everybody knows what to expect now, so enjoy.

"In Her Shoes" is a movie that takes an awfully long time to really get itself going. It almost seems as though there are two movies going on even though they are both from the same book: 1) Rose (Toni Colette) coming to terms with how much being her sister's keeper has saved her from dealing with the fact that she hasn't really allowed herself to develop or find out what she's really about; and 2) Cameron Diaz's shallow and self-absorbed "bad girl", a habitual user, going down to Florida to scam her grandmother and finally discovering that she's not such an unredeemable loser after all.The problem for me is that the latter is such well-worn territory that showing all her episodes of personal failure prior to her grand faux pas of having sex with her sister's boyfriend become increasingly repetitive wastes of time -- especially the sequence with the two guys who take her to the impound lot and the first sequence that lands her in jail. None of this stuff -- in my opinion-- is needed in the film. We all know users like her; aside from the allusion to her dyslexia problem that she later addresses with Norman Lloyd, the other messes she creates are run-of-the-mill. They are treated with importance while shedding no new light on her character. Once we get to Florida and Shirley Maclaine catches onto her, then her ensuing transformation is worth watching, but by then we're halfway through the film. Hanson also seems obsessed with showing us everything he finds interesting about filming a movie that is supposed to take place in Philadelphia.So much for the film's pacing problems. Everything else works quite well. The performances are all excellent. Shirley Maclaine, Norman Lloyd, Jery Adler, and Mark Feuerstein are all terrific in their supporting roles with the last showing a very nice and quirky chemistry with Collette. Maclaine is surprisingly understated and not surprisingly magnificent.

"In Her Shoes" is noteworthy for its crisp dialogue, lively repartee, and multi-dimensional characters, For her novel and for her screenplay, Jennifer Weiner and Susannah Grant, respectively, both deserve an extra curtain call for exemplary work.Because of the careful scripting, all three of the leading characters played by Toni Collette, Cameron Diaz, and Shirley MacLaine were strong roles with no single character dominating the script. The two sisters, Rose and Maggie, shared the focus in the first half of the film, and MacLaine's grandmother Ella provided a strong impetus in the latter portion.While all three performances were superb, the trickiest role was Maggie the tomcat. Cameron Diaz brought depth to the role, and one scene especially stood out when Maggie's learning disability was revealed. As she struggled with her reading of the poem in the hospital room, a new dimension of the character suddenly emerged. The scene was sensitively played by Diaz, and the dialogue was, once again, dynamic, sustaining dramatic interest at a point when the impetus of the film could have been lost.It was impressive as well that the screenplay offered some delectable dialogue for the small parts, especially in the members of the retirement community of Florida. There were many delightful and humorous moments. Yet, the screenplay provided depth and detail in a rich emotional tapestry.One character that deserves special acknowledgment was the Professor, blind and dying in the Florida hospital. The role was played with great understatement by Norman Lloyd, a veteran character actor who performed with Orson Welles' celebrated Mercury Theatre. Prior to his stunning success in "Citizen Kane" and even before his notorious "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast, Welles was a luminary in the New York theatre. One of the great Shakespearean productions in America in the last century was Welles' 1937 production of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" that was part of the Federal Theatre Project. Norman Lloyd played the small but crucial role of Cinna the Poet, and, although Lloyd battled with Welles during the rehearsals, the death scene of Cinna the Poet underscored the theme of fascism that Welles wished to evoke. "In Her Shoes" provides Lloyd with another small, but memorable role. Lloyd's was a riveting performance, and the film would not have been the same without it.Part of the genius of Shakespeare was his ability to individualize and make memorable even the tiniest roles in his plays. This was the strength as well of "In Her Shoes" and an example of some of the finest screen writing in recent years.

A relationship with a video store clerk is an important thing when you like to watch movies. He can let you have Star Wars III the weekend before its due to hit the shelves, or he can waive the late fee, or unofficially give you free rentals because you've rented over 1000 movies from him.Most importantly, when you can't decide what to watch, he can tell you what he thinks, and make a few suggestions. If you have a good relationship, he'll put more thought into it, and you'll know better how your tastes and his intersect. This happened to me last night.So my video go-to guy suggested, in a bold and shocking move, In Her Shoes, which at first glance is nothing but a sappy chick-flick that even my Girlfriend balked at. He insisted, pointing out that the director, Curtis Hanson, had also made Wonderboys (but forgetting to mention L.A. Confidential, for some reason). He described its merits, and eventually convinced me and my Girlfriend.And so I watched In Her Shoes, best described as a character driven drama with some funny moments. It was very good, and my faith in the Video Guy is renewed. This movie is probably the first time I ever liked Cameron Diaz in a movie. Toni Collette is great, as is Shirley MacLaine. The rest of the supporting cast is strong. While there is no real umph behind the visuals, the movie doesn't really suffer from it, in as much as the focus is character, not visual.My only reservation about this movie is that it comes on a little strong by times. It achieves levels of saccharine sweetness that jar the overall mood of the movie. The overt sentimentality, while awfully effective (barely a dry eye in the house), leaves a bad aftertaste. The same, I think can be said of a few comedic moments, that while funny, seem to stand out as maybe not part of the right movie. I'm glad I didn't watch it by myself, but as a couple movie, go for it.I'm planning a overhaul of my rating system, given that I'm not sure about the efficacity of the old one. In the old system, I think this movie would be a 3.75, maybe a 4 at a stretch, outta 5. My Girlfriend loved it.

I love Toni Collette, and I hate how she's so often cast as "the fat girl," when she's not fat at all! She's so talented, so beautiful, and the only way on earth that a director can get away with calling Collette "the fat one" is by putting her next to Cameron Diaz in nothing but underwear. And that's exactly what director Curtis Hanson did. But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that Diaz's character, the beautiful-but-slutty sister Maggie, is supposed to be in her underwear or a bikini for 85% of the story, and that that's exactly what Maggie does in the original book. I'm sure a male director had nothing to do with that decision.So besides leaving Toni Collette off the poster entirely and calling her character "fat," I had no problem with In Her Shoes. There are some honestly endearing scenes (especially between Collette's character, Rose, and her eventual-boyfriend, Simon), and bring your tissues for a couple of poem-readings that will make you cry. The commercials make In Her Shoes look predictable and formulaic, but I think you should see it for yourself. Never judge a film until you've walked a mile in its shoes. (I'm so puny!)

Poor Shirley MacLaine tries hard to lend some gravitas to this mawkish, gag-inducing "feel-good" movie, but she's trampled by the run-away sentimentality of a film that's not the least bit grounded in reality.This was directed by Curtis Hanson? Did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him? Hanson can do effective drama sprinkled with comedy, as evidenced by "Wonder Boys." So I don't know what happened to him here. This is the kind of movie that doesn't want to accept that life is messy and fussy, and that neat, tidy endings (however implausible they might be) might make for a nice closing shot, but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go through.My wife and I made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred -- e.g. "the old man's going to teach her to read and then drop dead." Bingo! This is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches summarizing their emotional problems, making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they're that aware of what's causing them. Toni Collette (a fine actress, by the way, and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here), gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them, spelling out in flashing neon the film's awkward connecting motif. At that moment, I knew what I was in for, and the film was a downward spiral from there.Grade: C-

Don't be too harsh on this film. A chick-flick? Perhaps, but lots more than that! This film is about women relationships with just the right touch of comic relief many of these films normally lack. Hats of for everyone who contributed to this film! A good script, great acting and stellar craftsmanship of director Curtis Hanson make this one hit the bulls-eye, or very close indeed. I expected a decent comedy, which - in part - it certainly is, but the performances are so good and the characters so alive and breathing that I soon forgot about the initial comic aspect of the film. Right from the start, the film sucks you into the story, which just ring true.Two sisters with quite opposite characters, sexy, uneducated party animal Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and the somewhat dull responsible lawyer Rose (Toni Collette), are unwillingly confronted with each other. They learn that they can actually learn something from their deficiencies and combine the strands they have - with help from their grandmother - to improve their lives. Curtis Hanson expertly directs in an appropriately modest fashion He knows his job and manages to focus on character development but doesn't forget to add the occasional comic relief. The cast shines with Cameron Diaz in what might be her best role so far. The still vastly underrated Australian Toni Collette, who shined as the vulnerable ugly duckling in MURIEL'S WEDDING (1994), is just perfect in her role a Rose, and there's Shirley Maclaine as the sister's grandmother with a somewhat low-key part, but she knows how to handle it, expertly. A treat! Perhaps some minor flaws: The story takes some time to get going. A bit too much focus on Cameron Diaz's legs, which is completely unnecessary and Maggie's partial illiteracy and incapability to get a job might have needed somewhat more background or explanation. What beautiful woman, no matter how stupid she might be, could have any difficulty finding a job? Highly unlikely. But these are minor quibbles. Worth your time, even if you are one of three guys in a crowd of three hundred women in the cinema;)Camera Obscura --- 9/10

Maggie and Rose are totally different sisters. While Rose is a serious and hard-working lawyer, Maggie is crazy and spoils her life in a party after another, selling her body to earn money. After a great argument, Rose makes Maggie out of her house and she, having nowhere to go, will travel to Florida, where their Grandma lives. There she will discover the sense of helping the other people and to have a decent job (tahnks to grandma!). Meanwhile, Rose will learn how to be more open to new experiences and she will find love. although it has a typical plot, the movie is not annoying at any time. Sometimes funny, sometimes touching, it is able to tell you a well structured story, with quite well built characters (unusual in this kind of movies). Acting of Tony Collette and Shirley McLane is unexpectedly good (while Cameron Diaz is just correct), which makes the movie more interesting. It is a genre that artistically is not very good, but, probably one of the best movies of this type. It is quite long (130') but it does not seem so, it is no masterpiece, but is perfect to enjoy relaxed an afternoon or a long bus travel.

This story of siblings losing each other and their way latches onto the core strength of both the 2 leading actors. Some light hearted attempts at humour kept the drama in the comedy section but the real tale is a deep and loving display of the need to stay connected to family and to communicate.
Well done.

Cameron Diaz amazes in this delightful little film. ALERT! For all men! "In Her Shoes" is the perfect movie to see with all the important women in your life: Wife or girlfriend(s), daughters, sisters, mother, mother- n-law, aunts, cousins, friends and grandmothers! You've got my 100% guarantee that all of them will love it! So you can please them all and treat yourself to some eye candy, too, because scenes abound with Cameron Diaz romping around in a scant bikini in this rather amusing and interesting story which interweaves a patchwork of unusual family ties.Diaz plays Maggie, the very attractive inveterate party-girl. Rose (Toni Collette), the successful workaholic lawyer, plays counterpoint to her sister, Maggie. When an industrial size faux pas, committed by Maggie, drives a Grand Canyon size wedge between these polar opposite siblings, Maggie tempestuously decides to cut ties with Rose and relocate to Miami in order to seek out her estranged grandmother (Shirley Maclaine) whom she has not seen since she was a little girl. The sisters take advantage of this forced hiatus in their relationship to achieve personal growth and self-improvement.😊😊Fate, as it so often does in real life, plays an important role both in the development of the story and in the lives of its characters.The nuanced on-screen chemistry between the three leading characters is exquisite! "SHOES" shows some rather original and interesting elements. Observing the artistic growth of Cameron Diaz over the years, I now consider her an exceptional actor. Here, Diaz fleshes out her character; converting each action and reaction into world-class natural! In one close-up, her face fills the entire screen,at a moment when Maggie is feeling extremely tired and stressed. She clearly projects a frail, aging fatigue at the precise real-time twilight of her youth! Not many Divas would lend themselves to such a scenario to improve a scene!8.5*....... ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!!!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!

It's not the best romantic comedy in the market but this movie always makes me cry. I have a sister too and even though our relationship is nothing like in the film I understand their love for each other.

Rose Fellow (Toni Collette) is a hard working straight laced lawyer. Her sister Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is a hot drunken mess who can't keep a job. They have a massive fight after Maggie sleeps with Rose's boyfriend. Maggie becomes homeless and starts living with a grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) neither knew. Meanwhile Rose quits her job and starts a dog walking business.This movie is too unnecessarily slow. Toni Collette is great and Cameron Diaz is interesting. They have a great scene together. But the great scenes in this movie are separated by too much filler. Cameron Diaz could be darker. The drama simmers along for far too long. The sisters are great together but the movie's not as explosive separated. The long middle is held back as we wait for the inevitable reunion.

SPOILERS CONTAINEDThat is how long and awful this movie is. Two major rules broken by Curtis Hanson: 1. It is well over 2 hours which immediately breaks first the sacred covenant of chick flicks - KEEP IT SHORT (1.5 hours or less). Yes, you hate your sister and your step-mom. Yes, the cute guy cheated on you with your sister. Yes, the nice guy you overlooked in your sensitive knight in shining armor. Move it along, we've seen it all before 2. 2nd rule- IF YOU DIRECT ONE OF THE BEST ACTION & SUSPENSE MOVIES EVER MADE (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), DON'T LOSE YOUR MIND AND SETTLE FOR THIS GARBAGE.I really can't believe it, Curtis. What happened? I can't believe you are not directing better movies than this.

It's hard to imagine that the same director who gave us "L.A. Confidential" and "Wonder Boys" is the same filmmaker who has now given us a film that makes Rob Reiner look like Ingmar Bergman. Even a silly fantasy romp like "8 Mile" had it's moments of genuine truth but here Curtis Hanson is clearly working with a story that doesn't sustain the edge that he attempts to establish early on. Story is about two sisters, one is a boozy illiterate named Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and the other an intelligent Philadelphia lawyer named Rose (Toni Collette) and the two of them were raised by their father after their mother died when they were young.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Maggie drinks and steals and sleeps around endlessly while Rose who's a few pounds heavier attempts to be the responsible big sister and watch over her but one day Maggie finally crosses the line and is thrown out. Rose finds out that her sister not only has been stealing again but finds her in bed with a potential boyfriend and orders her to get out of her life completely. With nowhere to go Maggie heads to Florida after discovering that she has a long lost grandmother named Ella (Shirley MacLaine) and is allowed to stay with her in her retirement home. Meanwhile, Rose leaves her job and gets engaged to a former co-worker but she has incredible difficulty in telling him about the details of her relationship with her sister. Maggie finds Ella unflappable but supportive and is urged to get a job at the assisted living center and eventually it's here that Maggie starts to find herself and mature.First off, I am recommending this film for others to see and it's primarily because of the good performances that take place despite a script that's aimed strictly for viewers of the Lifetime channel. One can't help but wonder what exactly Curtis Hanson saw in this story that would attract him to the project because the film is about as revolutionary as an episode of "The Gilmore Girls". The best moments (for me anyway) come during the first part of the film where we come to understand Rose's frustration with her immature sister and Collette in her role gives the film it's best performance. In fact, all the actors are fine with MacLaine playing her usual crusty but experienced older woman and even Diaz (whom I'm an admitted non-fan of) plays her character well but the script by Erin Brockovich's Susannah Grant dives head on into sappy predictable material like the scenes where Maggie learns how to read. I guess the reason I'm still recommending this film is because I just don't think it would be fair to all of the actors involved who really do a good job despite the lack of depth with the story. Call me a softy if you have to but I think I would be lying if I didn't say that this still offers enough scenes of emotional turmoil for it's characters to shine and to also give the film whatever heart it has.

This film tells the story of two sisters, one of them has the brains and the other has the looks. Though they are very close, their relationship is severely tested by an indiscretion.You can tell this film is all about Cameron Diaz, as the camera focuses on her various body parts on many occasions. Fortunately, Toni Collette provides a great non superficial contrast to save the film from being too shallow. The story is about family relationships, and it focuses on a bit too many relationships, making it unfocused. I thought it was dragging on a bit, but the version I watched was already a cut version that was ten minutes shorter. I still enjoyed it, especially how Toni Collette finally finds herself and her love. The retirement facility is a good subplot too. I did say the film is a bit too long, but if they could expand just a little on the grandson of the professor, and maybe make him more prominent in the film after he gets introduced, it would have been a great Hollywood ending.

Old wounds, family secrets, screwed up relationships with perfectly logical explanations. A film that starts beautifully and then spends an inordinate amount of time meandering to finally arrive to its soft but beautiful center. Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette have wonderful moments as the star crossed sisters. Their feelings as genuine as they are, never seem to find a common ground until Shirley MacLaine makes her entrance. I must confess I was very moved by her, by her performance. Her most human and real in many, many years. She is the glue that keeps all the elements together and presents them to us with that unmistakable flair of hers for feisty truths and uncompromising tough love. I don't know quite how I feel about Curtis Hanson as a director. Personally, my favorite of his films is "Wonder Boys" and in a way "In Her Shoes" is closer to that one, without being as good, than any of his other movies. However, I'm recommending it wholeheartedly, specially to my sisters.

Maggie Feller is a destructive young woman who has no regards for her sister Rose, or anyone, for that matter, as we meet her. This Maggie is a mess, but what caused her to be that way? One keeps wondering how she could even be related to the meticulous Rose, a lawyer, who seems to be in control of her life. That is, until Maggie appears at Rose's door and disrupts her life, committing the ultimate sin, messing around with her sister's lover! The only thing these sisters have in common is the passion for the fancy shoes Rose loves to buy and Maggie, a penniless girl can't afford.Curtis Hanson directed this film in which the main characters are women. Men only play a small part in this tale about two young sisters, that in spite of loving each other, grow distant because the carelessness of Maggie. Adapted from the Jennifer Weiner novel of the same title, the movie version was adapted by Susannah Grant.The main reason for watching this uneven film is Toni Collette, who as Rose, gives one of her most detailed performances in recent memory. Ms. Collette makes us believe she is this woman whose life unravels because her irresponsible sister. Ms. Collette is perfect as the mousy Rose, who secretly would like to be like her sister, but can't bring herself to do it.Cameron Diaz goes into a transformation in the film. We get a hint of her problems as she auditions for an MTV spot. She has grown into a wild young woman because her mother was not around to supervise, or pay attention to the sisters. But whereas Rose goes to make something of her life, Maggie rebels and does destructive things to herself. It is not until she gets to meet her unknown grandmother that she begins to put her life to good use and in the process discovers what's wrong with her.Shirley MacLaine is seen in one of the most sedate characters of her screen career as the grandmother Ella. Family problems intervened between her and a son in law that didn't want to have her around at any cost and alienated Ella from her granddaughters. Ms. MacLaine disappears into her role and gives an underplayed performance that sets well with her two co-stars.While the film could have used some trimming, the first half has a little more spark than the second part, which turns into a formula picture. Curtis Hanson doesn't break any new ground with this film.

In Philadelphia, the irresponsible and selfish Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is a drunken easy woman having sex with many men. Her sister Rose (Toni Collette) is the opposite, responsible lawyer but needy and having complex, compulsively buying shoes to relief her frustrations. Maggie is expelled from her father home by her stepmother, and Rose lodges her sister in her apartment. When Maggie has one night stand with Rose's boyfriend, Rose sends her sister away. She finds letters and postcards from her missing grandmother Ella Hirsch (Shirley MacLaine) that she believed had died that lives in a retirement compound in Florida hidden in her father's drawer, and without any option, she decides to travel to meet Ella. With Ella, Maggie changes, becoming another woman and improving the relationships in her family."In Her Shoes" is a feel-good comedy with an excellent lead trio of actresses. The story about sisterhood and parenthood is bitter sweet, alternating funny and dramatic moments and with a nice conclusion. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Em Seu Lugar" ("In Your Place")

Enjoyable but slightly flawed, In Her Shoes is definitely deeper than a chick-flick in the handling of the characters. Toni Collette is excellent as usual, as well as Shirley MacLaine, yet I couldn't help thinking while watching that I should read the book it was based on and get a deeper look at these people and their lives. I felt the film could have gone into more detail and I expected it to be longer, as so many plot developments felt somewhat simplified to fit them all in to a 2-hour running time. That's my biggest criticism of the film, but it was enjoyable in general and I had a wonderful time watching. A few other things I enjoyed: the Rocky reference (my favorite), and the opening sequence during the credits. I have to credit this last one to both screenwriter and director for this incredible opening, which in completely visual terms sets up the film's themes. The titles are presented in cuts between the two sisters, highlighting both their conflict and their connection to one another. Generally, it has a nice balance between dead-seriousness and light drama, but I wish there was more of it to comment on.

I had apprehension about "In Her Shoes" because Cameron Diaz has been in so many movies where she plays just a fluff of a character. But not here, where she is Maggie Feller, who we learn very early just doesn't seem able to hold down a job, uses SEX to her advantage, and usually ends up crashing with a friend or relative for as long as they will tolerate her. Toni Collette plays her very different sister Rose Feller, an attorney in Philadelphia who acts and looks a bit homely, and who marvels that she might be able to attract a really nice guy. After one too many screw ups, Rose kicks Maggie out, about the time Maggie finds out that not only is her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) alive, she is living in Florida in a retirement community. (Mom had died when Maggie was very small, and her dad "shielded" her from grandma.)Much of the story is Maggie and Grandma coming to an understanding, and Maggie figuring life out for herself there.SPOILERS. One reason Maggie had problem was her undiagnosed and untreated dyslexia. Grandma found her looking for cash, and made a deal with her. If she got a job, Grandma would match her salary dollar for dollar, so that Maggie could save up $3Grand to go to New York to make it as an actress. Doing hospital duty, Maggie met an older man who insisted she read to him. A retired professor, he helped Maggie face her dyslexia and learn to deal with it.

CHICK FLICK! Chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick fliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick! What else could you possibly expect from a movie about sisters that involves shoes and a search for their grandmother? That's all you need to know. You either like the genre, you don't like the genre, or your girl forces you to watch the genre with her. Accept which one applies to you and go with it. If you're chickflicktose intolerant then this obviously isn't for you.That being sad, I must admit that thanks to good character and relationship development, good acting, and believable characters set within a believable story, I enjoyed it. Granted, Cameron Diaz's long legs might have had something to do with enhancing my enjoyment, but I was entertained nonetheless.Things start off a little slow as the relationship between the sisters is allowed to grow, but once Maggie finds herself in Florida, working at an old folks' home, the story and laughs start to pick up. There's one old woman who is particularly funny. I don't know her name (you'll recognize her by the fact that she's in a wheelchair most of the time), but she reminded me of my grandmother, commenting on how Diaz "puts a postage stamp on her bottom and calls it a swimsuit" and acting shocked that there are now pants that exist with "'juicy' written across the hiney." How can you not be entertained by a crotchety old woman's outlook on how the times have a-changed? If reading comprehension has got you down and you're still struggling with whether or not you want to see this, let me break it down even further. This is a story about the love between sisters. They fight, they drift apart, they find out their grandmother is still alive, and they make their way back to each other. All sorts of lessons on love, self-discovery, romance, and who owns whose heart are explored. There's even some sappy poetry reading thrown in for good measure. I know that this all sounds like a huge shot of estrogen, but thankfully, things never get as syrupy as you might expect.That doesn't mean there's any shortage of attempts to strain a tear out of the female (and non-manly) eyes. I almost missed out on some dialogue thanks to the sniffling of the four ladies sitting in front of me. So gals, bring your tissues. Guys, if your gal brings you along then bring the sewing kit. You'll need to sew 'em back on after this one. All right, everybody knows what to expect now, so enjoy.

"In Her Shoes" is a movie that takes an awfully long time to really get itself going. It almost seems as though there are two movies going on even though they are both from the same book: 1) Rose (Toni Colette) coming to terms with how much being her sister's keeper has saved her from dealing with the fact that she hasn't really allowed herself to develop or find out what she's really about; and 2) Cameron Diaz's shallow and self-absorbed "bad girl", a habitual user, going down to Florida to scam her grandmother and finally discovering that she's not such an unredeemable loser after all.The problem for me is that the latter is such well-worn territory that showing all her episodes of personal failure prior to her grand faux pas of having sex with her sister's boyfriend become increasingly repetitive wastes of time -- especially the sequence with the two guys who take her to the impound lot and the first sequence that lands her in jail. None of this stuff -- in my opinion-- is needed in the film. We all know users like her; aside from the allusion to her dyslexia problem that she later addresses with Norman Lloyd, the other messes she creates are run-of-the-mill. They are treated with importance while shedding no new light on her character. Once we get to Florida and Shirley Maclaine catches onto her, then her ensuing transformation is worth watching, but by then we're halfway through the film. Hanson also seems obsessed with showing us everything he finds interesting about filming a movie that is supposed to take place in Philadelphia.So much for the film's pacing problems. Everything else works quite well. The performances are all excellent. Shirley Maclaine, Norman Lloyd, Jery Adler, and Mark Feuerstein are all terrific in their supporting roles with the last showing a very nice and quirky chemistry with Collette. Maclaine is surprisingly understated and not surprisingly magnificent.

"In Her Shoes" is noteworthy for its crisp dialogue, lively repartee, and multi-dimensional characters, For her novel and for her screenplay, Jennifer Weiner and Susannah Grant, respectively, both deserve an extra curtain call for exemplary work.Because of the careful scripting, all three of the leading characters played by Toni Collette, Cameron Diaz, and Shirley MacLaine were strong roles with no single character dominating the script. The two sisters, Rose and Maggie, shared the focus in the first half of the film, and MacLaine's grandmother Ella provided a strong impetus in the latter portion.While all three performances were superb, the trickiest role was Maggie the tomcat. Cameron Diaz brought depth to the role, and one scene especially stood out when Maggie's learning disability was revealed. As she struggled with her reading of the poem in the hospital room, a new dimension of the character suddenly emerged. The scene was sensitively played by Diaz, and the dialogue was, once again, dynamic, sustaining dramatic interest at a point when the impetus of the film could have been lost.It was impressive as well that the screenplay offered some delectable dialogue for the small parts, especially in the members of the retirement community of Florida. There were many delightful and humorous moments. Yet, the screenplay provided depth and detail in a rich emotional tapestry.One character that deserves special acknowledgment was the Professor, blind and dying in the Florida hospital. The role was played with great understatement by Norman Lloyd, a veteran character actor who performed with Orson Welles' celebrated Mercury Theatre. Prior to his stunning success in "Citizen Kane" and even before his notorious "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast, Welles was a luminary in the New York theatre. One of the great Shakespearean productions in America in the last century was Welles' 1937 production of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" that was part of the Federal Theatre Project. Norman Lloyd played the small but crucial role of Cinna the Poet, and, although Lloyd battled with Welles during the rehearsals, the death scene of Cinna the Poet underscored the theme of fascism that Welles wished to evoke. "In Her Shoes" provides Lloyd with another small, but memorable role. Lloyd's was a riveting performance, and the film would not have been the same without it.Part of the genius of Shakespeare was his ability to individualize and make memorable even the tiniest roles in his plays. This was the strength as well of "In Her Shoes" and an example of some of the finest screen writing in recent years.

A relationship with a video store clerk is an important thing when you like to watch movies. He can let you have Star Wars III the weekend before its due to hit the shelves, or he can waive the late fee, or unofficially give you free rentals because you've rented over 1000 movies from him.Most importantly, when you can't decide what to watch, he can tell you what he thinks, and make a few suggestions. If you have a good relationship, he'll put more thought into it, and you'll know better how your tastes and his intersect. This happened to me last night.So my video go-to guy suggested, in a bold and shocking move, In Her Shoes, which at first glance is nothing but a sappy chick-flick that even my Girlfriend balked at. He insisted, pointing out that the director, Curtis Hanson, had also made Wonderboys (but forgetting to mention L.A. Confidential, for some reason). He described its merits, and eventually convinced me and my Girlfriend.And so I watched In Her Shoes, best described as a character driven drama with some funny moments. It was very good, and my faith in the Video Guy is renewed. This movie is probably the first time I ever liked Cameron Diaz in a movie. Toni Collette is great, as is Shirley MacLaine. The rest of the supporting cast is strong. While there is no real umph behind the visuals, the movie doesn't really suffer from it, in as much as the focus is character, not visual.My only reservation about this movie is that it comes on a little strong by times. It achieves levels of saccharine sweetness that jar the overall mood of the movie. The overt sentimentality, while awfully effective (barely a dry eye in the house), leaves a bad aftertaste. The same, I think can be said of a few comedic moments, that while funny, seem to stand out as maybe not part of the right movie. I'm glad I didn't watch it by myself, but as a couple movie, go for it.I'm planning a overhaul of my rating system, given that I'm not sure about the efficacity of the old one. In the old system, I think this movie would be a 3.75, maybe a 4 at a stretch, outta 5. My Girlfriend loved it.

Positives: An interesting poem, a couple of moments where you actually cared what was happening. Negatives: Film lacked focus and direction - seemed to meander for the most part. Toni Collete's character was so bland, it didn't give her a chance to really act. Cameron Diaz's character was so shallow - probably about what she could handle - but you really didn't care about either of them throughout the movie. The middle is the only part where a couple of interesting things happened - the beginning and ending where completely lame. And there was really no resolution to the title "In Her Shoes" other than Cameron Diaz's character taking and using (and ruining) various pairs of shoes (yawn). While this movie had a couple of moments that were interesting, at the end we just rolled our eyes and regretted wasting the 2 hours.

Having previously tackled a wide range of themes in his films, Director Curtis Hanson delves into the love/hate relationship of two disparate sisters in the film, In Her Shoes. The result is an enjoyably entertaining comedy/drama featuring a number of topflight performances and some hilarious dialogue.Maggie Feller (Cameron Diaz) is an irresponsible, practically illiterate alcoholic who sleeps around and mooches or steals to get by in the world. Her sister, Rose Feller (Toni Collette) is a self conscious, workaholic lawyer who is dating her boss and indulges in her one passion, fashionable dress shoes. (Maggie's obsession with Rose's sexy heels recalls an ongoing theme of television's Sex and the City.) Both sisters lost their psychologically impaired mother to a supposed car accident that affected their family over the years. One day Maggie is thrown out of her house by her step mother and dad. Finding refuge with her sister, Rose, she proceeds to make life miserable with her carefree attitude and interference that ends in embarrassment and anger for both. As Rose's romantic and professional life is turned upside down, Maggie is sent packing and turns to one last hope, her maternal grandmother she never knew, namely Ella Hirsch (Shirley MacLaine). Ella works in a retirement community in Florida, and Maggie's appearance causes quite a stir. When she lost her daughter, Ella lost touch with her granddaughters, and Maggie's 'visit' serves as a catalyst for reconnection. Maggie's visit becomes a reawakening of sorts for herself and a chance for Ella to rediscover her lost family. Meanwhile, Rose is at a crossroads in her life and decides to change course in her job and finds romance from an unlikely source. Anxious to reunite her granddaughters, Ella resorts to extreme measures to bridge an emotional gap as her two girls begin to discover their own identities in unique and unexpected ways.This is a gem of a film. It says something when you realize early on that you are watching something special. Curtis Hanson (L.A.Confidential, Wonder Boys) has struck gold with Susannah Grant's (Erin Brokovich) adaptation of the best seller by Jennifer Weiner. The film is really about the secrets and lies that cripple a family over time and how a strange course of events revisit the relationships or lack thereof. Hanson and the company do a marvelous job of balancing some very funny dialogue with more serious, dramatic scenes. There are some great, memorable lines, some of which are funny and smart without losing sight of the context of the story. A number of scenes are touching and affecting in their sensitive handling of real emotions without becoming clichéd. It's nice to see real people who change over time and how seemingly inconsequential supporting characters gradually come to the forefront.The acting by the entire cast is strong and you appreciate the little nuances in facial expression and inflection of dialogue that enrich each character. This may be Cameron Diaz's best performance. That's saying something as the glamorous model has been more star than actress in her most popular films (Charlie's Angels, There's Something About Mary) and she is given a juicy role with sharp direction. Toni Collette has always been a solid actress in any film (Sixth Sense, The Hours) but she has found a wonderful character in Rose and makes the most of it. Shirley MacLaine (Terms of Endearment, The Turning Point) is terrific in what is a change of pace role where she eschews makeup to look her age and shows a maternal wisdom that is the stuff of Supporting Oscars. You wish there were more of her in the film, but what's there is delicious. It's nice to see an old pro like Norman Lloyd still displaying his acting chops in what is a minor role of a bed-ridden patient who has a profound influence on Diaz's character.The performances are complemented by seamless editing which not only captures the right reactions, but effortlessly switches back and forth between the two sisters especially during key scenes that are thematically linked. Although the running time goes over two hours, the pacing is good, and everything seems integral to the storyline. The musical score by Mark Isham is quite effective in complimenting the emotional moments without ever being intrusive.Despite its strong script, the film never fully explores Maggie's transformation which, while uplifting and remarkable, is never totally convincing given her origins and tendencies. Things get wrapped up in a dreamy sendoff which is perhaps too good to be true, but those same qualities also make for a more upbeat film.Hanson displays a very keen eye in relating what is essentially a woman's film. Yes, this may be considered a woman's film in its theme and target audience, but considering the fact it is also a well made, funny, and heart rending film about love and family, the women ought to bring along the men. In Her Shoes is not just about rival sisters but rather it is about a family yanked apart and slowly brought together again in ways that are not altogether apparent at the start. How these lost souls meld together is the stuff of high entertainment and substance.

I love Toni Collette, and I hate how she's so often cast as "the fat girl," when she's not fat at all! She's so talented, so beautiful, and the only way on earth that a director can get away with calling Collette "the fat one" is by putting her next to Cameron Diaz in nothing but underwear. And that's exactly what director Curtis Hanson did. But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that Diaz's character, the beautiful-but-slutty sister Maggie, is supposed to be in her underwear or a bikini for 85% of the story, and that that's exactly what Maggie does in the original book. I'm sure a male director had nothing to do with that decision.So besides leaving Toni Collette off the poster entirely and calling her character "fat," I had no problem with In Her Shoes. There are some honestly endearing scenes (especially between Collette's character, Rose, and her eventual-boyfriend, Simon), and bring your tissues for a couple of poem-readings that will make you cry. The commercials make In Her Shoes look predictable and formulaic, but I think you should see it for yourself. Never judge a film until you've walked a mile in its shoes. (I'm so puny!)

Poor Shirley MacLaine tries hard to lend some gravitas to this mawkish, gag-inducing "feel-good" movie, but she's trampled by the run-away sentimentality of a film that's not the least bit grounded in reality.This was directed by Curtis Hanson? Did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him? Hanson can do effective drama sprinkled with comedy, as evidenced by "Wonder Boys." So I don't know what happened to him here. This is the kind of movie that doesn't want to accept that life is messy and fussy, and that neat, tidy endings (however implausible they might be) might make for a nice closing shot, but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go through.My wife and I made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred -- e.g. "the old man's going to teach her to read and then drop dead." Bingo! This is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches summarizing their emotional problems, making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they're that aware of what's causing them. Toni Collette (a fine actress, by the way, and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here), gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them, spelling out in flashing neon the film's awkward connecting motif. At that moment, I knew what I was in for, and the film was a downward spiral from there.Grade: C-

Don't be too harsh on this film. A chick-flick? Perhaps, but lots more than that! This film is about women relationships with just the right touch of comic relief many of these films normally lack. Hats of for everyone who contributed to this film! A good script, great acting and stellar craftsmanship of director Curtis Hanson make this one hit the bulls-eye, or very close indeed. I expected a decent comedy, which - in part - it certainly is, but the performances are so good and the characters so alive and breathing that I soon forgot about the initial comic aspect of the film. Right from the start, the film sucks you into the story, which just ring true.Two sisters with quite opposite characters, sexy, uneducated party animal Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and the somewhat dull responsible lawyer Rose (Toni Collette), are unwillingly confronted with each other. They learn that they can actually learn something from their deficiencies and combine the strands they have - with help from their grandmother - to improve their lives. Curtis Hanson expertly directs in an appropriately modest fashion He knows his job and manages to focus on character development but doesn't forget to add the occasional comic relief. The cast shines with Cameron Diaz in what might be her best role so far. The still vastly underrated Australian Toni Collette, who shined as the vulnerable ugly duckling in MURIEL'S WEDDING (1994), is just perfect in her role a Rose, and there's Shirley Maclaine as the sister's grandmother with a somewhat low-key part, but she knows how to handle it, expertly. A treat! Perhaps some minor flaws: The story takes some time to get going. A bit too much focus on Cameron Diaz's legs, which is completely unnecessary and Maggie's partial illiteracy and incapability to get a job might have needed somewhat more background or explanation. What beautiful woman, no matter how stupid she might be, could have any difficulty finding a job? Highly unlikely. But these are minor quibbles. Worth your time, even if you are one of three guys in a crowd of three hundred women in the cinema;)Camera Obscura --- 9/10

I was very surprised by this movie. I try not to expect too much of films my girlfriend can't wait to see. I was surprised this didn't follow the usual 'mills & boon' formula with sisterly love hate peppered loosely. Certain references in particular to the shoe thread throughout kept the interest of the majority of girlie's around, but the evolving relationships of the main characters were finely crafted and kept the interest of non-chick-flicking shoe-loving shopaholic minority. The music was nice backdrop to the lives of Rose and Maggie, but for my money, the use of E.E. Cummings poems took this past the norm and into the quite enjoyable category.If you're not a chick flick fan worth the viewing time.If you are, well worth the entrance fee too.

Cameron Diaz amazes in this delightful little film. ALERT! For all men! "In Her Shoes" is the perfect movie to see with all the important women in your life: Wife or girlfriend(s), daughters, sisters, mother, mother- n-law, aunts, cousins, friends and grandmothers! You've got my 100% guarantee that all of them will love it! So you can please them all and treat yourself to some eye candy, too, because scenes abound with Cameron Diaz romping around in a scant bikini in this rather amusing and interesting story which interweaves a patchwork of unusual family ties.Diaz plays Maggie, the very attractive inveterate party-girl. Rose (Toni Collette), the successful workaholic lawyer, plays counterpoint to her sister, Maggie. When an industrial size faux pas, committed by Maggie, drives a Grand Canyon size wedge between these polar opposite siblings, Maggie tempestuously decides to cut ties with Rose and relocate to Miami in order to seek out her estranged grandmother (Shirley Maclaine) whom she has not seen since she was a little girl. The sisters take advantage of this forced hiatus in their relationship to achieve personal growth and self-improvement.😊😊Fate, as it so often does in real life, plays an important role both in the development of the story and in the lives of its characters.The nuanced on-screen chemistry between the three leading characters is exquisite! "SHOES" shows some rather original and interesting elements. Observing the artistic growth of Cameron Diaz over the years, I now consider her an exceptional actor. Here, Diaz fleshes out her character; converting each action and reaction into world-class natural! In one close-up, her face fills the entire screen,at a moment when Maggie is feeling extremely tired and stressed. She clearly projects a frail, aging fatigue at the precise real-time twilight of her youth! Not many Divas would lend themselves to such a scenario to improve a scene!8.5*....... ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!!!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!

Maggie and Rose are totally different sisters. While Rose is a serious and hard-working lawyer, Maggie is crazy and spoils her life in a party after another, selling her body to earn money. After a great argument, Rose makes Maggie out of her house and she, having nowhere to go, will travel to Florida, where their Grandma lives. There she will discover the sense of helping the other people and to have a decent job (tahnks to grandma!). Meanwhile, Rose will learn how to be more open to new experiences and she will find love. although it has a typical plot, the movie is not annoying at any time. Sometimes funny, sometimes touching, it is able to tell you a well structured story, with quite well built characters (unusual in this kind of movies). Acting of Tony Collette and Shirley McLane is unexpectedly good (while Cameron Diaz is just correct), which makes the movie more interesting. It is a genre that artistically is not very good, but, probably one of the best movies of this type. It is quite long (130') but it does not seem so, it is no masterpiece, but is perfect to enjoy relaxed an afternoon or a long bus travel.

This story of siblings losing each other and their way latches onto the core strength of both the 2 leading actors. Some light hearted attempts at humour kept the drama in the comedy section but the real tale is a deep and loving display of the need to stay connected to family and to communicate.
Well done.

It's not the best romantic comedy in the market but this movie always makes me cry. I have a sister too and even though our relationship is nothing like in the film I understand their love for each other.

Rose Fellow (Toni Collette) is a hard working straight laced lawyer. Her sister Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is a hot drunken mess who can't keep a job. They have a massive fight after Maggie sleeps with Rose's boyfriend. Maggie becomes homeless and starts living with a grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) neither knew. Meanwhile Rose quits her job and starts a dog walking business.This movie is too unnecessarily slow. Toni Collette is great and Cameron Diaz is interesting. They have a great scene together. But the great scenes in this movie are separated by too much filler. Cameron Diaz could be darker. The drama simmers along for far too long. The sisters are great together but the movie's not as explosive separated. The long middle is held back as we wait for the inevitable reunion.

SPOILERS CONTAINEDThat is how long and awful this movie is. Two major rules broken by Curtis Hanson: 1. It is well over 2 hours which immediately breaks first the sacred covenant of chick flicks - KEEP IT SHORT (1.5 hours or less). Yes, you hate your sister and your step-mom. Yes, the cute guy cheated on you with your sister. Yes, the nice guy you overlooked in your sensitive knight in shining armor. Move it along, we've seen it all before 2. 2nd rule- IF YOU DIRECT ONE OF THE BEST ACTION & SUSPENSE MOVIES EVER MADE (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), DON'T LOSE YOUR MIND AND SETTLE FOR THIS GARBAGE.I really can't believe it, Curtis. What happened? I can't believe you are not directing better movies than this.

First things first. I didn't like Cameron Diaz as an actress. 90% of her movies were brainless...but they were delightful indeed. But in "In her shoes" I saw a TOTALLY different Cameron Diaz. I saw a great actress, maybe her best role in her entire life. The movie tells us a story about 2 sisters, Maggie (Diaz) and Rose (Toni Collette). They are totally different from each other. While Rose is an outstanding Lawyer, responsible and VERY shy, Maggie is a lazy, drunk, irresponsible and a troublesome girl, who wants just spend money (stealing or not) on unnecessary stuffs. The way how they fight, blame, and love each other is really impressive. Cameron and Toni REALLY WERE sisters, and that realism was what made me love this movie. You will laugh, you will cry, you will learn about love, and you will learn about forgiveness. This is one of the most beautiful movie that I've ever seen. Watch, rent, BUY it if necessary... You will not regret, I assure you!

"In Her Shoes" is a mostly successful effort at sustaining a bittersweet comedy about imperfect adult family members affecting each other as they learn to live with each other by growing and changing. The film well demonstrates that the way people interact with the world is based on how they learned to interact as children with their immediate family members so that we are still those children inside.Director Curtis Hanson is in his "Wonder Boys" territory, but this time focusing, atypically for him, on the women. His quick back and forth editing on the two sisters' parallel lives keeps the pacing brisk and rooted in some realism. His facility with cityscapes works well to establish the sisters in their separate environs, particularly Cameron Diaz as she lurches, on the titular heels, from one dark disaster to the next, particular with men.The acting makes up for what are on the surface quizzical casting choices. Diaz and Toni Colette are only believable visually as sisters in the sense that they both are females; I expected the Big Family Secret Revelations to be that they had different mothers, especially when family members comment how much Diaz looks like the mother but the photos sure don't reflect that or maybe that she will have inherited another ominous similarity from her mother. But they manage to establish a rapport of once closeness that's fraying apart, though the past intimacy is only implied.I suppose it's intentional that Colette blends more into her scenery, as a literal wallflower, as she likes playing these supposed Plain Janes (as in "Muriel's Wedding," "Clockwatchers" and "About A Boy") and here she has claimed to have gained 28 pounds for the role so that the family can rib her "Rose Feller" about her weight but she looked normal to me and only the scraggly brown hair in her face and clunky glasses telegraphed that this was a movie star playing ugly duckling.I would have liked more evidence that she was not a mouse in her lawyer skills, but we don't really see a demonstration of her competence to contrast with Diaz's floundering but sexy "Maggie Feller" as they gradually cross-over how they each gain confidence to face their pasts and forge a new future together. I suppose there's some sort of feminist message about the advantages of entrepreneurship for women.Beyond the opening voice-over narrative, the relationships are developed very well visually. I particularly liked how Mark Feuerstein's "Simon Stein" is believably introduced and evolved into the story line as a romantic interest. Unlike the cardboard males in most chick flicks, he seems like a real, three-dimensional guy who is endearingly trying to make a connection with a colleague. It is not just due to Grant's adaptation of Weiner's novel that he manages to be not quite hunky but cute and appealing, especially in a charming use of a stereotyped romance novel for seduction (though how his character stays thin when restaurant eating is his #1 hobby is the magic of the movies), and even though wearing glasses he is not a push-over even through to the conclusion -- I really felt for him when "Rose" hurts his feelings. But then unlike most chick flicks, even the guys who do bad things get to explain their own hang-ups.Shirley MacLaine is literally playing her "Terms of Endearment" character 23 years later, with only a slight change in the post-story line. By bringing that past association with her, we believe more about her interactions with her son-in-law and grandchildren than demonstrated in this script. I liked the gradualness of her developing rapport with Diaz. The candy-colored, sterile production design around her Del Ray, FL retirement community is a marvelous contrast to the wintry messy Philly setting, though there are too many easy "Golden Girls"-type jokes. Hanson commendably resists the usual chick flick tendency to string together pop tracks until over halfway through, and here the Jamaican songs thematically refer to a key scene and are even mostly by the original performers (though I was surprised that he didn't use a cover of Jimmy Cliff's "Sitting Here In Limbo" that would have changed the gender.)The other pop culture in jokes are amusing - the gathering around the TV to watch the also Jimmy Choo shoe-obsessed "Sex and the City" (which Feuerstein guested on); Diaz's character not being able to read a line about Eminem, of Hanson's "8 Mile"; and Colette's character setting a "Rocky"-like goal of running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum. The poetry reading is incorporated a bit heavy-handed but at least it's believable that Norman Lloyd is a retired English professor who could patiently introduce the joy of reading poetry to someone who has never read it before.What is jarring was the choice to keep the Jewish context of the novel even with the casting of Ken Howard, MacLaine, Colette and Diaz, who are individually not given any Jewish shtick or personal connection. All the secondary characters are still made explicitly, and unnecessarily, Jewish -- we see "Scott"s bar mitzvah photo, his dad makes a "mazel tov" toast and a key scene is a Jewish ritual; the residents of the retirement community have specifically Jewish names and inflections, particularly the best friend "Mrs. Lefkowitz"; and the evil Step Mother is a caricature of a Jewish Mother bragging about her "My Marsha" daughter who gets a spiteful comeuppance that's odd given that the only way I could absorb the main characters was by assuming that they were gentiles who had married into a Jewish family or children of an inter-faith marriage. The only justification I could think of was to have a warm ethnic family surroundings a la "Big Fat Greek Wedding," but the importance of family and friends could be demonstrated with surroundings that matched the lead actors more credibly.

It's hard to imagine that the same director who gave us "L.A. Confidential" and "Wonder Boys" is the same filmmaker who has now given us a film that makes Rob Reiner look like Ingmar Bergman. Even a silly fantasy romp like "8 Mile" had it's moments of genuine truth but here Curtis Hanson is clearly working with a story that doesn't sustain the edge that he attempts to establish early on. Story is about two sisters, one is a boozy illiterate named Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and the other an intelligent Philadelphia lawyer named Rose (Toni Collette) and the two of them were raised by their father after their mother died when they were young.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Maggie drinks and steals and sleeps around endlessly while Rose who's a few pounds heavier attempts to be the responsible big sister and watch over her but one day Maggie finally crosses the line and is thrown out. Rose finds out that her sister not only has been stealing again but finds her in bed with a potential boyfriend and orders her to get out of her life completely. With nowhere to go Maggie heads to Florida after discovering that she has a long lost grandmother named Ella (Shirley MacLaine) and is allowed to stay with her in her retirement home. Meanwhile, Rose leaves her job and gets engaged to a former co-worker but she has incredible difficulty in telling him about the details of her relationship with her sister. Maggie finds Ella unflappable but supportive and is urged to get a job at the assisted living center and eventually it's here that Maggie starts to find herself and mature.First off, I am recommending this film for others to see and it's primarily because of the good performances that take place despite a script that's aimed strictly for viewers of the Lifetime channel. One can't help but wonder what exactly Curtis Hanson saw in this story that would attract him to the project because the film is about as revolutionary as an episode of "The Gilmore Girls". The best moments (for me anyway) come during the first part of the film where we come to understand Rose's frustration with her immature sister and Collette in her role gives the film it's best performance. In fact, all the actors are fine with MacLaine playing her usual crusty but experienced older woman and even Diaz (whom I'm an admitted non-fan of) plays her character well but the script by Erin Brockovich's Susannah Grant dives head on into sappy predictable material like the scenes where Maggie learns how to read. I guess the reason I'm still recommending this film is because I just don't think it would be fair to all of the actors involved who really do a good job despite the lack of depth with the story. Call me a softy if you have to but I think I would be lying if I didn't say that this still offers enough scenes of emotional turmoil for it's characters to shine and to also give the film whatever heart it has.

This film tells the story of two sisters, one of them has the brains and the other has the looks. Though they are very close, their relationship is severely tested by an indiscretion.You can tell this film is all about Cameron Diaz, as the camera focuses on her various body parts on many occasions. Fortunately, Toni Collette provides a great non superficial contrast to save the film from being too shallow. The story is about family relationships, and it focuses on a bit too many relationships, making it unfocused. I thought it was dragging on a bit, but the version I watched was already a cut version that was ten minutes shorter. I still enjoyed it, especially how Toni Collette finally finds herself and her love. The retirement facility is a good subplot too. I did say the film is a bit too long, but if they could expand just a little on the grandson of the professor, and maybe make him more prominent in the film after he gets introduced, it would have been a great Hollywood ending.
