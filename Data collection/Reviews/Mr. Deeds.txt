Mr. Deeds, the remake of Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town is an old comedy that is personally one of my favorite comedies. It's just a wonderful film that I highly recommend you watch if you get the chance. So Adam Sandler decided to take on that classic and make it into his film, which honestly isn't that bad, just in comparison, believe me then you look at it as a horrendous film. It was just one of those movies that really didn't need a remake. But Adam Sandler did bring his own bite to the film and just updated the story for the younger generation that obviously never heard of the movie.After Preston Blake freezes to death at the summit of Mount Everest with a triumphant smile on his face, a search for his heir for his successful company begins. When it is found that he has a living nephew named Longfellow Deeds who runs a pizzeria in New Hampshire, Deeds is contacted and brought to New York City by attorney & businessman Chuck Cedar. Plans are made for Deeds to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer, but he must remain in New York for a few days as all the legal details are worked out. The story is major news, and reporter Babe Bennett, who works for a tabloid show, has a friend pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds, because their research indicated Deed wanted to meet a girl by saving her, the same way his father had met his mother. Deeds rescues her and she continues to go out with him under the disguise of Pam Dawson, school nurse. Though Pam initially hopes to just get a good story on the new heir, she eventually falls for the kind-hearted Deeds while realizing that all she's done is lie to him and wants to be with him. Chuck is also up to no good in wanting to take over the company from Deeds and doesn't have the best intentions.Mr. Deeds has a few funny moments, even though it was incredibly immature, I do have to admit that I got a kick out of the scene where Longfellow shows off his frostbite foot and tells the servant to hit it with the fire poker, and screams to freak him out, yeah, it's something that most little brothers would do to their older sibling, but it still got a laugh. Wynonia Rider was actually pretty good in the film, she was very adorable, but her chemistry wasn't exactly on key with Sandler, not her fault, just I wasn't feeling it too much in the film. Over all the film is worth the look if you see it on TV, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see the movie.5/10

This, once again, has most of the earmarks of modern-day comedies: tons of sexual innuendos, lots of good laughs but many of them out of questionable lines or behavior, and a stupid, rushed ending that tries to make all the good guys win and the bad guys lose. The latter is fine - I want the good guys to prevail - but they way they go about it is stupid.I did think this movie had a little softer edge than most other blatantly-low class "Something About Mary/American Pie"-type comedies of today however. I guess what I am saying is this isn't as in-your-face type offensive most of the rest are.Of course, Adam Sandler is playing the low-key Gary Cooper role of Mr. Deeds from the 1940s, so he's not the high-strung Happy Gilmore type here, although he does get violent at times. Winona Ryder plays the love interest, a tabloid low-moral reporter who is reformed by the amiable Mr. Deeds. She's not believable at all and one can see one reason she isn't much of star actress anymore. It isn't just her real-life problems. She's pretty and she's okay in the role but something's missing in her acting.The real star of the film is John Turturro, as the Spanish butler. He's funny in about every scene he's in and he's a guy everyone roots for here.In summary, it's a pretty nice film, with a number of laugh-out-loud scenes, but it's still a long way from the Gary Cooper-Barabara Stanwyck classic film version, at least in terms of an aw-shucks wholesome hero. This film just doesn't have the heart and soul of the original, because it's more concerned with cheap laughs than a moral message. Still, it has its funny moments and I found worth watching.

Mr. Deeds is very similar to many other Adam Sandler films. The film follows a basic and predictable formula. Many of the comedian's reliable standards are in effect: abuse of old folks, crude humor, a Rob Schneider appearance, and mentally deficient sidekicks. Some of the stuff works, but there's not much room for originality. This movie even perpetuates Sandler's trend of playing guys who are unexpectedly good at dishing out beatings. Many have considered Mr. Deeds to be one of Adam Sandler's more underrated films, and in several ways it is. However the film is typical but entertaining in some areas. It is a decent comedy, and the humor is what one would expect from a Sandler film.

Nobody goes to see an Adam Sandler movie for spiritual enrichment or intellectual stimulation - let's get that out of the way first. Once you accept you've paid your money to be mildly entertained in a lighthearted, slapstick manner, strap in and enjoy the ride. I keep hearing Sandler is a major Hollywood player these days with an equal footing as producer as he is actor (he has produced a considerable amount with fellow actor Rob Schneider - the similarly inane but funny - mostly in spite of yourself - Hot Chick being the most recent example, in which he has a cameo role and indeed, Schneider helps Sandler out in Mr Deeds) so it's hard to prove that Sandler is now typecast as a lovable fool, because it's fairly likely he chose the part himself, possibly aware that Hamlet might be a little out of his league. Sandler need only check his bank balance to see that the lovable fool is certainly a lucrative one, having made an absolute mint playing countless other characters blessed with naive charm and a heart of gold. The story - we all know it's a remake of the classic depression-era propaganda film starring Gary Cooper, designed to lift spirits and foster a sense of community - centres around a picturesque New England town and its perenially-cheerful, smalltown inhabitants, chiefly Longfellow Deeds (Sandler), who inherits a fortune from an uncle he never knew, finds himself at the helm of a media empire and heads to the Big Apple to find out more. Here Winona Ryder steps in as the ambitious TV reporter determined to get her big scoop and dupes the affable Deeds into falling in love with her. All the time she's wearing a wire and a hidden camera to enable their courtship and his antics, sometimes drunken, sometimes heroic, to be broadcast on the evening news. Typically Deeds is the last to know and is appalled when he makes the connection. By which time Ryder's character has fallen in love herself, resigned from her job and is begging for a second chance. Deeds' only flaw is a short fuse and this is at odds with his generous spirit, who at times could be George Bailey, James Stewart's kindly smalltown character in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946), but this spices things up a little and allows the suspension of disbelief to continue a little longer. The number of disrespectful, foulmouthed city folk he takes out is entertaining, while not always convincing, but then times have changed and these days your average bloke doesn't think of taking a swing at a man for swearing in front of a lady (more's the pity I say). While you could aim criticism at this and jeer at the corny lines and simplistic moral at the film's end, there is something to be cherished here. The moral of course being that money is less important than being true to yourself, and while you're at it, be nice to your neighbour. As Mother Teresa once said, kindly words are heard once but their echoes are heard for ever - Deeds' character and his deeds (pun definitely intended) themselves are echoes of another, lamentably more innocent time and it's uplifting to see this spirit so laboured in the film's remake. It's also refreshing to see this bravely recreated by the producers, who have not shied away from dealing with the film's essence in these cynical times. It's not all sentimental Queen of Hearts stuff though. There are some hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments that counter the film's message perfectly - the helicopter ride to Manhattan where the crew and Deeds are singing 'A Space Oddity' complete with air-guitar springs to mind here - and there is the usual dose of slapstick you'd expect from a Sandler picture. The 7 flying cats rescued from a burning building by our hero is particularly memorable and as I say, I was laughing in spite of myself. This humour compliments the film's slushy message and prevents any actual retching in the theatre - leaving the cinemagoer shuffling out content, with a smile on his face - definitely a feelgood movie. I just hope Sandler doesn't attempt It's A Wonderful Life next, I don't think the world's quite ready yet.

Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) is a small town guy who is taken to the big city when he learns he has an inheritance of $40 billion from a long lost uncle. He has to adjust to life in a Palatial Mansion with a personal butler, and he meets a beautiful school nurse (Winona Ryder); but its not long before the money begins to change everything, and he learns things are not what they seem.This remake is not without plenty of laughs, but it never quite manages to do anything thats truly hilarious or new. For a bit of fun its worth a watch, but it's one of those films that you will forget about pretty quickly.6/10 its just average i'm afraid

I really enjoy Adam Sandler,dont get me wrong, but this has to be his worst movie to date and one of the worst movies i have ever seen. When you go to see an Adam Sandler movie you expect a lot of laughs,however this movie was very,VERY unfunny. In the 40 min. my friend and i watched there was NOTHING funny in the movie at all and nobody laughed. It was so boring my friend started to fall asleep,that was our cue to go. This movie is hideous,save your money.

What an awful movie. I wanted to get up and walk out after the first 15 minutes but my nephew insisted that we stay. If it wasnt for him.....I most certainly would have walked out !!!!!! What a disappointment and a waste of money.

Just watched this movie last night and the final verdict is: I loved it. Idk what all these other people be talking about. The character of Deeds is so incredibly likable and admirable and the film genuinely had me laughing in some points. Don't listen to the others hating on this film. Everyone should go watch it and decide for themselves because in my opinion, he film is genuinely super fun.COMEDY:
The comedy in this film is fair. It could be better for a movie labeled "comedy" however it's not enough to ruin the movie. Beside this, there are three or four moments that had me cracking up.PLOT/SUBSTANCE:
This movie's plot is fairly easy to understand and it works well for the movie. The plot is not bad nor great, it's just enough to push the film along and I think it fits great. When writing this category, I ask myself what would you have left if you took out all the comedic moments and characters and yes, I think the plot would hold up. It may not be very interesting, but luckily we have comedy and characters in the final product.CHARACTERS:
Now, this is the real saving grace of this film. For the most part, Deeds himself. He is one of the most lovable characters I've seen on screen in a long time. He is just a genuinely good guy and tbh I wish I could be more like him and I wish there were more people in the world like him. All the other characters really just make him better. It's seeing how they interact with a character as well done and as purely good as deeds on it's own, that really makes this movie worth watching. And Adam Sandler's performance just drives it home. Perfect casting right there. Y'all are some idiots if you don't like this bro like wth?THEMES:
Man, the movie's got heart. I don't know what else to say. The movie has heart all the way through, usually brought to the screen by Deeds, but throughout the movie and his acts, he makes the characters around him better and this is honestly phenomenally fun to watch and it really makes you feel better as a person and look at what is around you and just be grateful.SEE THIS DAMN MOVIE! I BET YOU WONT REGRET IT!

I wanted to comment on the stupidity of some people. I saw this in the Goofs.Continuity: At the press conference, when Emilio is told he is the sole heir, he is standing on a balcony. In the shot immediately after it, he suddenly appears at the podium.This was listed as a Goof. I don't think the person that wrote this watched the whole movie. If they did, they would not have under estimate the sneakiness of Emilio. He pops-up many time throughout the movie like this. It's what makes him funny in this COMEDY! If you have seen the movie you would know that Emilio is very very sneaky. So this was not a mistake. Duh!

Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) lives in the small town of Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, where he runs the local pizza parlor. His real ambition, however, is to write verse for Hallmark's greeting cards. Yet, so far, every rhyme he has sent them has been rejected. That does not matter to the townies, who love hearing Deeds recite his poems at the restaurant. One day, a billionaire (Howard Keel) dies on top of Mount Everest. He leaves no will, making it necessary for his huge company to seek out any heirs. You guessed it, Deeds is a long-lost nephew who inherits a boatload of dough. The company manager, Chuck (Peter Gallagher) wants to give Deeds 42 billion to sell his stock shares back to him. Deeds agrees at first. But, once he gets to his uncle's posh Manhattan mansion where servant Emilio (John Turturro) waits on him hand and foot, Deeds has second thoughts. Not only that, but he meets a beautiful local lady named Pam (Winona Ryder) and he is enchanted by her. But, beware, Deeds. Pam is really a reporter named Babe who is out to get dirt on him. And, are there indeed secrets to uncover? Who will end up with the money? This is really a sunny film for a rainy day. It is lighthearted fun with an absolutely terrific cast. Sandler is quite funny, of course, but John Turturro steals every one of his scenes with a performance that should have garnered him an Oscar. It's THAT good, yes. Ryder, Steve Buscemi, Gallagher, and many others are true delights as well. Then, too, the film looks amazing, from the costumes to the sets and beyond. It appears that no expense was spared and the result is a lovely-to-look-at film, too. Finally, the script is imaginative and humorous, making the viewer chuckle and grin nonstop. Do you, indeed, want a film to vanquish the blues after a rough day? You could, truly, find no better remedy than this one.

"Mr Deeds" tells the fictional story (although i guess it could happen in real life) of country hick Longfellow Deeds (Sandler, who stretches himself and plays a lovable goofball) who inherits billions of dollars from a distant uncle. To seal the deal he must go to New York to do all the paperwork. While here he discovers some people are mean and try to take advantage of people. Will Deeds be screwed over and left with nothing? See it to find out (or watch another Sandler movie and take a wild guess).Has its moments, and has some great scenes and lines, but it's no Oscar candidate (this was later proved when it wasn't nominated for an Oscar). Some great work by the supporting cast, most notably Steve Buscemi and John Turturro. Not bad, some good quirky laughs to be had.

How they got THAT movie out of the beloved classic "Mr Deeds Goes to Town", I'll never know.  The only similarity is in the name of the lead character.Everybody overacted their role, and acted as stupid as possible.  There wasn't enough relationship development between Winona's character and Deeds. In the *real* Mr Deeds (goes to town), the reporter and Deeds actually do establish a relationship.Just rent or buy the real dvd to the classic movies.  If you're not afraid of real movies that don't have sex, toilet jokes, animal abuse, then you'll love the real thing.  This production of Mr. Deeds is a joke.Check under "Mr Deeds Goes to Town" in imdb.

Since this remake of a classic movie is an Adam Sandler flick, you can pretty much predict most of it, namely the fact that he can get aggressive and that one character eventually reveals something embarrassing about himself. But otherwise, you're sure to have a good time. As an earthy goof-ball inheriting a massive fortune and turning the business world upside down, Sandler makes the most of his role. In supporting roles, Winona Ryder, John Turturro and Steve Buscemi have some great moments. Obviously, "Mr. Deeds" isn't any kind of "Citizen Kane"-style masterpiece, but it doesn't pretend to be; and let's face it, this movie easily beats any Jean-Claude Van Damme movie for smarts. Nice, goofy fun. Also starring Allen Covert, Peter Gallagher and Jared Harris.

...but it felt like torture watching this thing. Now, I admit, I'm not a very big Sandler fan. Honestly, I don't know how he became the cash cow he is in Hollywood. But seeing him on talk shows and having been blown away by Punch Drunk Love, I tend to think there actually is something going on beneath the goofy, lovable frat-boy veneer. But good luck trying to find it in this movie.I don't want to get too critical here--the real reason I had to write this is that the person before me wrote six or seven paragraphs on this movie and I was dumbfounded--this movie isn't even worth that much effort. It is so poorly made, from the acting (Turturro an exception as always)to the flat, lifeless cinematography. I really hate the way both Steven Brill and Peter Segal shoot their movies--completely unimaginative and frustratingly boring.I'm sure they keep a fun and lively set going but come on, the images in front of me need some life too. This movie was at times painful to watch--as I do like Winona Ryder and most all the actors involved in this. But it almost seemed like stunt casting (let's get some great actors from independent movies [inexpensive] and give them nothing to do but act out poorly devised stereotypical roles that are supposed to hark back to Capra films)--none of the actors seemed comfortable, especially Winona... ugh...You have talent Adam, don't be afraid to loosen your creative control and get a decent writer and/or director every once in a while to remind folks.

This is certainly an Adam Sandler movie.  Doesn't stray too far from the formula.This was a funny movie, with many, many laughs.  I must say, John Tuturro (sp) stole the movie.  He was just "on" through his entire part!This is not even close to the original (thank goodness) but still an enjoyable 90+ minutes.

well here is a sweet mischievous film from Adam Sander called Longfellow deed he writes greeting cards that are like poems to people in a place called mandrake falls on known to him his long lost uncle is hanging out on mount Everest but his uncle gets frozen and deeds becomes 40 billion richer or does he so off to the big city with the whole town wishing him well but deeds is simple or something so he not used to mischievous people so he lets people walk over him as the company is a media empire there is reporters everywhere looking to find out who deeds is and mischievous news chief likes to make up stories to get ahead so comes up with a story to find out and deeds finds love of sorts with a nurse or so it seems but accidentally he finds a diary from his uncle past and his mysterious fast footed personal butler is quite the charmer so but with a few sporting legends cameos ruining the deeds public image things aren't what the seem has deeds being fooled or does he have straiten every one out with a bit of common sense or few right hooks with a so called nurse of his 7/10 I taught is was a touching comedy drama with a hint of romance this is my 60 review

"Mr. Deeds" tells of a wacky, naive small town guy, Mr. Deeds (Sandler), with little respect for fame or fortune who inherits $40 billion and has to deal with the responsibilities and media attention which accompanies his inheritance. Ryder plays a tv producer after the inheritance story who happens to fall in love with the Sandler character, something which  pushes this flick from romantic-comedy into the realm of fantasy or sci-fi. In spite of its hard-to-swallow romantic side plot, the film offers nonstop in-your-face silliness and nonsense which should make it a fun watch for fans into Sandler's brand of deadpan kookie comedy. Non-Sandler fans can expect a lukewarm result. (C+)

Sandler fans beware! This movie tries to develop a plot around 40 billion dollars but fails. It is a string of Sandler jokes, sight gags and skits that we've all seen before in one form or another and they don't even work with the story line.Unfortunately the string is frequently broken and we are left with stale comedy. Sandler is not believable as the simple small town guy that does not care about the money. If you want to see a good comedy about a regular Joe who inherits a lot of money go rent Brewster's Millions.

Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) is a small town guy who is taken to the big city when he learns he has an inheritance of $40 billion from a long lost uncle. He has to adjust to life in a Palatial Mansion with a personal butler, and he meets a beautiful school nurse (Winona Ryder); but its not long before the money begins to change everything, and he learns things are not what they seem.This remake is not without plenty of laughs, but it never quite manages to do anything thats truly hilarious or new. For a bit of fun its worth a watch, but it's one of those films that you will forget about pretty quickly.6/10 its just average i'm afraid

Longfellow Deed (Adam Sandler) is an owner of a pizzeria in a tiny American city who inherits a fortune of forty billion dollars from a distant relative. He moves to New York and there he is chased by the press, searching for information about the newest millionaire in USA. A tabloid reporter (Winona Ryder) gets close to him to get inside information and guess what? Fall in love with him. Although being a predictable plot, this movie is a good family entertainment. Adam Sandler performs his usual role of a naive and good boy. Winona Rider is very beautiful in this movie. I am a fan of her, but I do not remember seeing her so gorgeous like in "Mr. Deeds". "Mr. Deeds" is an enjoyable movie that deserves to be watched and with a good and positive message in the end. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Herança de Mr. Deeds" ("The Inheritance of Mr. Deeds")

Spoilers ahead, probably.  The movie is simply awful, diseased and ridden with more fleas than Hennie Youngman's long dead one-liner underpants. Al Sharpton is hilarious to laugh at, except at the mercy of these writers. HOW DO YOU MAKE AL SHARPTON UNFUNNY?  John Turturro, John McEnroe, Steve Buscemi -- all talents (and funny!) drained by this vampiric script. Death reeks from every orifice here, from the greeting card "bits" (what else to call them?) to the hackneyed physical stuff.  Thoughts:--what's with Sandler's dubbed voice over Murph?  when will someone tell this idiot that he can't do "funny voices"?  HE CAN'T EVEN MANAGE HIS OWN RIDICULOUS VOICE.--get 40 billion dollars, toss $25k at a random couple in a restaurant, $40k for used bikes, rent MSG for a night:  the writers didn't even bother to stop drinking long enough to come up with ONE cool thing to do with a massive fortune.  HOW DO YOU MAKE BREWSTERS MILLIONS LOOK LIKE CINEMATIC GENIUS?--since when does nice mean RETARDED?--if smalltownville is so great, why's it full of psychos, dullards and freaks of nature?  (the self-defeating premise of doom)--didn't realize Ryder couldn't act.  Hmmmm.  much like Sandler, has been delivering the same performance again and again since onset of career--trying to show off how much you researched the bumblefunk towns of the northeast?  WICKED lame.--Stephen King is scary jokes?--how tiny do you have to be down under to make yourself into a phony physical tough guy in every movie?  i mean, does anyone actually believe that sandler can "beat the crap" out of anyone else?--on what network do you find a moustachioed limeystralian foreigner hosting an American television show?--sandler and romance::pasta and nuclear chunks. it's (unintentionally) funny that the premise also includes the phony "sandler could get someone if he didn't have money subplot"...can this guy even get dates as a movie star?  THIS is a leading man?--peter gallagher's eyebrows, bald guy's beard, everyone's performance -- SADISM.--french fries and oreo's on pizza?  hooooeeee!   that guy is mad cap. same guy that gives the hero the turning point plot exposition in the end. while you're at it, why don't you land the helicopter at Wendy's?  yeee haw. they're out of control.--OMG the torrent of lost jokes on the JETS.  ye gods, what a real writer could have done with them...--Yes, like any sensible American, I found myself actually rooting for the ice on the lake to win after the egregiously fat woman didn't have the cajones to finish the jobI am making travel arrangements to hollywood to personally get my money back from these thieves.  Time permitting, will torture them for 90-odd minutes by making them watch....well, Little Nicky comes to mind... ;)

I wanted to comment on the stupidity of some people. I saw this in the Goofs.Continuity: At the press conference, when Emilio is told he is the sole heir, he is standing on a balcony. In the shot immediately after it, he suddenly appears at the podium.This was listed as a Goof. I don't think the person that wrote this watched the whole movie. If they did, they would not have under estimate the sneakiness of Emilio. He pops-up many time throughout the movie like this. It's what makes him funny in this COMEDY! If you have seen the movie you would know that Emilio is very very sneaky. So this was not a mistake. Duh!

Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) lives in the small town of Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, where he runs the local pizza parlor. His real ambition, however, is to write verse for Hallmark's greeting cards. Yet, so far, every rhyme he has sent them has been rejected. That does not matter to the townies, who love hearing Deeds recite his poems at the restaurant. One day, a billionaire (Howard Keel) dies on top of Mount Everest. He leaves no will, making it necessary for his huge company to seek out any heirs. You guessed it, Deeds is a long-lost nephew who inherits a boatload of dough. The company manager, Chuck (Peter Gallagher) wants to give Deeds 42 billion to sell his stock shares back to him. Deeds agrees at first. But, once he gets to his uncle's posh Manhattan mansion where servant Emilio (John Turturro) waits on him hand and foot, Deeds has second thoughts. Not only that, but he meets a beautiful local lady named Pam (Winona Ryder) and he is enchanted by her. But, beware, Deeds. Pam is really a reporter named Babe who is out to get dirt on him. And, are there indeed secrets to uncover? Who will end up with the money? This is really a sunny film for a rainy day. It is lighthearted fun with an absolutely terrific cast. Sandler is quite funny, of course, but John Turturro steals every one of his scenes with a performance that should have garnered him an Oscar. It's THAT good, yes. Ryder, Steve Buscemi, Gallagher, and many others are true delights as well. Then, too, the film looks amazing, from the costumes to the sets and beyond. It appears that no expense was spared and the result is a lovely-to-look-at film, too. Finally, the script is imaginative and humorous, making the viewer chuckle and grin nonstop. Do you, indeed, want a film to vanquish the blues after a rough day? You could, truly, find no better remedy than this one.

While Most Adam Sandler films have annoyed me, he is once again trying to portray an actual character as opposed to himself. While he does accomplish this somewhat, one has a hard time believing that he is trying to be an actor instead of being something he has portrayed many times over. To say the least, I liked the film. There was a down home feel to the film, one which brought some nice sensibilities to it, but also had the slap stick comedy that doesn't necessarily have to be vulgar. While this film isn't necessarily the best film Adam Sandler has ever done (which is the Waterboy), it certainly isn't the worst.

It was definitely a bad deed making this movie. Yes, put everyone associated with film on the naughty list.I was gravely disappointed in this Sandler film. It was faintly funny with a sub par plot. Sandler and Ryder do not make a good duo at all, they both looked uninspired. You already know what you are going to get from Sandler, sometimes he is funnier than others. Please tell me what memorable film Ryder ever did in which she was a significant contributor? In fact, whenever I think of Winona Ryder (besides thinking klepto), I think of Beetle Juice and Edward Scissorhands: two movies from the 80's, and two movies in which she was just a subsidiary role player.Mr. Deeds just didn't have it. It seemed like it was more to fill the Sandler one-movie-a-year quota rather than be a decent film.

"Mr Deeds" tells the fictional story (although i guess it could happen in real life) of country hick Longfellow Deeds (Sandler, who stretches himself and plays a lovable goofball) who inherits billions of dollars from a distant uncle. To seal the deal he must go to New York to do all the paperwork. While here he discovers some people are mean and try to take advantage of people. Will Deeds be screwed over and left with nothing? See it to find out (or watch another Sandler movie and take a wild guess).Has its moments, and has some great scenes and lines, but it's no Oscar candidate (this was later proved when it wasn't nominated for an Oscar). Some great work by the supporting cast, most notably Steve Buscemi and John Turturro. Not bad, some good quirky laughs to be had.

How they got THAT movie out of the beloved classic "Mr Deeds Goes to Town", I'll never know.  The only similarity is in the name of the lead character.Everybody overacted their role, and acted as stupid as possible.  There wasn't enough relationship development between Winona's character and Deeds. In the *real* Mr Deeds (goes to town), the reporter and Deeds actually do establish a relationship.Just rent or buy the real dvd to the classic movies.  If you're not afraid of real movies that don't have sex, toilet jokes, animal abuse, then you'll love the real thing.  This production of Mr. Deeds is a joke.Check under "Mr Deeds Goes to Town" in imdb.

Since this remake of a classic movie is an Adam Sandler flick, you can pretty much predict most of it, namely the fact that he can get aggressive and that one character eventually reveals something embarrassing about himself. But otherwise, you're sure to have a good time. As an earthy goof-ball inheriting a massive fortune and turning the business world upside down, Sandler makes the most of his role. In supporting roles, Winona Ryder, John Turturro and Steve Buscemi have some great moments. Obviously, "Mr. Deeds" isn't any kind of "Citizen Kane"-style masterpiece, but it doesn't pretend to be; and let's face it, this movie easily beats any Jean-Claude Van Damme movie for smarts. Nice, goofy fun. Also starring Allen Covert, Peter Gallagher and Jared Harris.

...but it felt like torture watching this thing. Now, I admit, I'm not a very big Sandler fan. Honestly, I don't know how he became the cash cow he is in Hollywood. But seeing him on talk shows and having been blown away by Punch Drunk Love, I tend to think there actually is something going on beneath the goofy, lovable frat-boy veneer. But good luck trying to find it in this movie.I don't want to get too critical here--the real reason I had to write this is that the person before me wrote six or seven paragraphs on this movie and I was dumbfounded--this movie isn't even worth that much effort. It is so poorly made, from the acting (Turturro an exception as always)to the flat, lifeless cinematography. I really hate the way both Steven Brill and Peter Segal shoot their movies--completely unimaginative and frustratingly boring.I'm sure they keep a fun and lively set going but come on, the images in front of me need some life too. This movie was at times painful to watch--as I do like Winona Ryder and most all the actors involved in this. But it almost seemed like stunt casting (let's get some great actors from independent movies [inexpensive] and give them nothing to do but act out poorly devised stereotypical roles that are supposed to hark back to Capra films)--none of the actors seemed comfortable, especially Winona... ugh...You have talent Adam, don't be afraid to loosen your creative control and get a decent writer and/or director every once in a while to remind folks.

This is certainly an Adam Sandler movie.  Doesn't stray too far from the formula.This was a funny movie, with many, many laughs.  I must say, John Tuturro (sp) stole the movie.  He was just "on" through his entire part!This is not even close to the original (thank goodness) but still an enjoyable 90+ minutes.

When Longfellow Deeds, a small-town pizzeria owner and poet, inherits $40 billion from his deceased uncle, he quickly begins rolling in a different kind of dough.Moving to the big city, Deeds finds himself besieged by opportunists all gunning for their pie.Babe, a television tabloid reporter, poses as an innocent small-town girl to do an exposé on Deeds. Of course, Deeds' sincere naiveté has Babe falling in love with him instead.Ultimately, Deeds comes to find that money truly has the power to change things, but it doesn't necessarily need to change him....So the thing is about this film, is that it's been done time and time again by Sandler. He plays the nice guy against the odds, who meets a nice girl, but has a lot of obstacles to overcome, usually in the shape of very rich people.But these films work on so many levels. Not because of the story or the flow of the narrative, it's the random characters and their traits, that distract the viewer from the story, and just deliver the big laughs.There is nothing original in the story, but the fact that a tennis player can jump 15 or so feet in the air, an opera singer sings as he is being beaten up, John Tuturro being sneaky, just makes for the film to so silly, you cannot help but laugh.And laugh I did. It's one of Sandlers best films, and despite the fact his movies are gradually diminishing in quality, you cannot help but smile.It's a big fat sunshine movie, full of joy, and guaranteed to make you laugh.Don't be a snob, let yourself go....

Mr. Deeds  doesn't suck it just could have been funnier. All the reviews have said the funny parts are in the trailer which is true. Adam Sandler is normally funny when he plays an avergae joe but I dunno what happened here. I guess the main problem is the script.
