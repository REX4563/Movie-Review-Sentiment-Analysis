Had I not been forced to see this film because of my occupation (and the fact I have two young daughters), I would have avoided this particular production like Richard Simmons avoids women.However, no such luck came my way on this night, and I was subjected to one of the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly-acted movies of the year.Or in ANY year, for that matter."Bratz, The Movie" is supposedly based on those slutty-looking dolls with huge eyes, full lips and no noses; figures which many parents feel imbues their daughters with an overinflated infatuation with clothes, shoes and make-up. Unfortunately, this movie is live action (but still concentrates on the whole "appearance is the most important" thing).And while the film tries to touch on friendships being key, the main message here is that only thin, good-looking people are worth anything; and the only way to make a difference in the world is to wear the latest, most expensive fashions.As if any of this makes any difference, here's the basic plot outline: Four adolescent girls (all beautiful with perfect bodies), Yasmin (Natalie Ramos), Jade (Janel Parish), Sasha (Logan Browning) and Chloe (Skyler Shaye) enter high school. It's also needless to mention that none of these young women has even the most remote acting talents, whatsoever.In fact, I've seen better acting in a morgue. Friends, the combined talent of the entire cast and crew of "Bratz" could be put in a thimble and there would still be room for Rosie O'Donnell's butt.But I digress ...Anyway, these four vapid souls enter Carrie A. Nation High School (which is more than appropriate since I wanted to take a hatchet to the projection room during this preview) and immediately clash with uptight beauty queen, Meredith (Chelsea Staub) and her group of "Heathers" wannabes.Meredith - even though a freshman - has divided the entire academy into clicks (emo's, skaters, geeks, potheads, jocks, tree-huggers and other assorted losers). Why anyone accepts this pigeon-holing is beyond me, but wondering about this isn't worth the time it takes for a synapse to fire, so ...And while it's easy to see the above-mentioned no-names populating this production, it's quite disheartening to watch a veteran actor such as Jon Voight, who plays Meredith's father and school principal. He not only embarrasses himself in the movie, but has put a stamp of incompetence on what was once a stellar career.Oh, there's also a deaf kid, Dylan (Ian Nelson) who somehow has the power to hear Yasmin singing (oh, and he can spin turntables, as well).The picture's witless conclusion consists of a huge birthday bash for Meredith (see enters on an elephant) and a loud and irritating musical number (it's amazing what passes for entertainment in today's world).My little girls liked this film, but then again they are 3 and 7-years old. Unless you fit into this particular gender or age group - or are in a coma - you will see this entire enterprise as shallow as a saucer and empty-headed as Paris Hilton.Truly one of the worst movie-going experiences since "Are We Done Yet?"

Aaaaaaauuuugh!!!! This movie was so awful it makes me wish I had been struck blind and deaf as a child! I watched it with 2 friends, to try for an MST3K style viewing but.... it doesn't work!!! One of my friends became very still, and started attracting flies halfway through the film, and another one became temporarily quadriplegic from watching this! I'm 20... I haven't cried for any reason since I was 12, and this movie brought me to tears. Not from laughter, not sadness... it was SO bad, I had no emotions that could be connected to this film, and I just started crying because nothing else quite fit. If these people tried to perform like this two thousand years ago, they would have been stoned to death. The acting was so terrible, I think I lost my faith in mankind. The materialism in this movie was so... I can't even think of an adequate adjective to describe it... No wonder there are countries that want to see our way of life crumble... after seeing this movie, I almost agree with them. The MST3K guys would be speechless, watching this. It's so awful, no one could possibly lampoon this movie. It's too terrible to properly mock and satirize. I feel really terrible for the companies that sponsored this. They really lost out on this investment. The attempts at throwing in messages about individualism and inner strength would have worked, if there hadn't been the "be yourself, but dress fashionably to be accepted" message splayed across this film like roadkill. It's a good thing I didn't have any forks, or acetylene torches nearby... or I would have tried to stab/burn my brain out. I seriously considered gnawing my own leg off several times, to escape watching this film. I actually lost the ability to breathe after about 40 minutes of this film... I eventually remembered how, but it took a while. Not good... My roommate has completely lost his mind... he asks questions like, if Darth Vader showed up at our door, should we hang out with him, and some remarks about hollowed out breasts and orange juice... he's completely lost his mind. Don't watch this movie if you value your sanity!!!

Ugh. The first words that came out of my mouth when I found out my friend's sister wanted to see this for her birthday. First off, I have never bothered to play with Bratz dolls once in my life, nor will I ever. This movie has got to have some of the worst dialog in a movie ever. (Note to script writers: If you really have to put "OMG" as an actual spoken line, then I think it's time to rethink your career) After this monstrosity finally ended, I looked to my friend and we looked to her sister, who then informed us that the movie was horrible. In the words of the Bratz Girls: "Like OMG! No way!" Seriously, if you want to ruin someone's birthday, then I recommend Bratz: The Movie.

Well...first off..just why. If the intention of writing this film was simply because the last time a movie has been this cringe-worthy was Britney Spears' Crossroads, then the idea was a nail hit directly on the head.If you feel any emotion, be it happiness, joy, elation or even sadness (in context to the film, as opposed to its existence) during the running time of this film, you are unfortunately a biased person...or are 2 years old, in which case you would not have the mental capacity to read this or form opinion throughout the film...except for when to soil yourself during its run time.The sad truth is that this film was surely doomed from the start. No-one would in their right mind would write, direct and produce this film, under the impression that anyone would actually enjoy it except for toddlers...and, unfortunately, that peculiar clique...young girls who actually assume that they and there friends are actually Bratz."Oh, that film was totally written about us," they say.Unfortunately...it probably was.

My youngest two will not be seeing "Bratz" as I could not find anything about it worth merit in the preview. I do not allow the collagen-laced plastic ladies in my home, thinking it would be better to invite professional women of the evening to my home to play with the girls than the molded mini-ho variety. At least they would learn some class and depth. My girls will not grace the movie in the theaters (I am sorry I did), and it will NOT come to our home when in DVD.But I digress. Obviously, those veteran actors of rich talent, Lanie Kazan and Jon Voight, have some sort of money troubles. For both of them to appear in this, they must have reached dire straits indeed! I cannot begin to imagine what financial crisis both of them face, but appeal to the Industry: Please- You all take up causes and collections for everything from flood victims to stray presidential candidates. Can't you once help your own, and start the Kazan-Voight Foundation? They will appreciate your assistance, and not have to stoop to such menial prostitution of their talent!

Worst movie ever. Luckily, I didn't go to it with high hopes. The acting was horrific, the entire way through I had a strong urge to strangle every actor/actress who participated in it, as they could simply NOT act. The four main characters were so plastered in makeup, I couldn't make out what they actually looked like. The plot, lines and scenes were so cringeworthy, I had to look down and pretend I was somewhere else.This is coming from a twelve year old girl, so don't think it's biased. I have never, ever willed a movie to end before, but I found myself considering walking out of the theatre. I sincerely hope someone realizes what a mistake this movie was, and destroys all proof of its existence. No one, not even children, should ever have to set eyes on this abomination.The person who let this crap be released does not deserve to be involved with the movie industry.

So, my friends and I were searching on demand forever and couldn't find anything to watch. I see this film on the list, no idea what this movie is, but knowing well of the dolls. Thought it might be an animated movie or something else to keep us entertained. So I say "F*** it we're watching Bratz." and we did. It's a Saturday night and we are juniors in high school - our expectations aren't high.To start off, let me say that I know for a fact that this film was obviously in no way meant to be taken so seriously. I literally made this IMDb account just now simply to write this review for this movie. I see reviews of other members saying things like (a-hem), "No-one would in their right mind would write, direct and produce this film, under the impression that anyone would actually enjoy it except for toddlers...and, unfortunately, that peculiar clique...young girls who actually assume that they and there friends are actually Bratz.", or "If you really have to put "OMG" as an actual spoken line, then I think it's time to rethink your career", or even, "It makes high school seem like a horrible place full of cliques and a mean, prissy, "boss" figure that runs the whole school"My God. You people need to relax.We were all laughing hysterically the entire duration of this movie. This is literally one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen. But from the intentional overuse of predictable stereotypes of teen behavior/society in general, mixed with a good helping of cliché 'heartfelt' moments, we couldn't help from being amused.The budget was incredibly high. It is undeniably a very quality-made/high-end film (cinematography-wise). So in that sense its also pleasing to the eye. Very colorful. Lot's to look at.In comparison to a movie like Clueless, of course this film doesn't compare. But it is completely different. This is a movie about BRATZ DOLLS we are talking about. Bratz. As in, the child's toy. Expecting a Bratz movie to accurately depict high school life or common social interaction or whatever else you think it should have, is mad.However I do know that this is a film I will never forget.I will always have these fond memories of watching this astonishing film with my friends on a Saturday night. Being blown away by how outlandish it was, but enjoying it thoroughly as a fun movie night with friends.So let's chill out.

Pretty much all the reviews were negative so I'm here to shed some light. This movie was made with a 9-12 year old girl audience in mind. Bratz dolls were my favourite when I was little so of course, I bought this movie when it came out. I re-watched it last summer. I still love it. It has the same kind of ridiculousness you'd find in Mean Girls. It's cheesy but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I found the tunes really catchy (It's All About Me being my favourite). Many people are complaining but so what if they're all conventionally pretty, and like make-up and clothes? This is just a cute movie about friendship and standing out and being yourself. How could there be anything wrong with that? I agree many parts were unrealistic (adult freshmen and the whole seating chart thing), but with a young audience in mind (and a nostalgic teen audience), this movie is pretty good. There's really nothing much that's problematic in it. It's already a lot more racially diverse than other teen movie casts.

Okay, it looks like this film was created to do two things; Obviously, the first one is to give little girls another movie to add to their collection of princess/bubblegum memorabilia. The second one was likely to keep some of those girls off the street for at least two hours. For about a week, they (the makers) seemed to have accomplished both of those. On top of that, some parents decided to tag along because of the perception that is was good for the entire family... They couldn't have been more WRONG, because it seemed like a dumbed-down version of 'The O-C', written in a day care center. On top of that, girls who DO watch this film will be(or have been) convinced that they must be hip and cool to survive. In its time, the Bratz enterprise has killed more brain cells than a MILLION Coca-Colas. And there's NO upside to this film! It was long, stupid, slow, boring, obnoxious and incapable of keeping anyone's attention without using a weapon of some sort! I ask all you fine people, "WHAT DID ANYBODY SEE IN IT?!?!"

Bratz is not a good movie. It has a lot of stereotypes. It was trying to be one of those chick flicks but did not achieve. The deaf representation is not good. Deaf people are not just all the way deaf. Deafness is a spectrum. Plus nobody would ever read lips that far lol. If you want to watch Bratz, I recommend watching the cartoon version (the superior)

Well, let me start off by saying this was the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. My friends and I went to see this movie BECAUSE this movie had been awarded a full zero stars in the Chicago Tribune (and several other places).The good things about this movie, is perhaps that the producers must have spent a lot of money hiring people and buying a lot of clothes. Some of the clothes were sure pretty cool, and if I were a girl, I'd probably wear them. One thing, is that I never understood when the phrase "Brat" ever became a good thing and how a high school teenager hitting on a 11 year old was ever a good thing.The movie included such insensitive material, and the idea is very unoriginal. This is not to mention that the other Bratz movie that came out on the 8th of August now number 1 on the bottom 100 of the IMDb list. I don't understand how the Asian girl, becomes the mathlete/science team superstar; the Latino bratz girl has tons of Latino people in her house all the time, INCLUDING a Mariachi band and she and her mom start singing that very popular song that... "la coucou-ra-cha"... you know what I mean... song. Oh, also the girl who is awarded the scholarship at the end of the movie... because she "needs it"... can afford to go shopping all the time and has a big house as well? I actually only enjoyed it BECAUSE it was so bad, and because some of the scenes in the movie were just so awkward and hilarious. negative 3 stars for being that awful.

Actually, almost everything. I normally don't comment on films I haven't seen all the way through, but since I currently work in a cinema and have had to endure snippets of this rubbish for the last couple of days I feel I have seen more than enough to comment on it.First off...walking through the auditorium doors at any point during this "movie" is like being battered repeatedly about the head by a deranged thug wielding a piece of two-by-four. You can literally feel your conscious mind sagging in defeat as the dreadful mindlessness of it washes over you. It really is a palpable thing.At no point that I saw did any of the lead girls display anything remotely like acting ability. They can't even be referred to as wooden, since the term "wooden actor" at least implies some ability, however dismal.All that this movie offers is the most pitifully superficial gratification for the absolute youngest girls. And all the movie seems to teach is that being superficial and shallow is the best way to "get on" in life.And what the heck is John Voight doing in here? At what point was he convinced that doing a teen movie based on a set of ugly, under-dressed and over made-up dolls was a good career move? I really pity people with small daughters...this movie must be the worst kind of hell for them. Parents....you have my commiserations.SUMMARY: Plot - Ronald McDonald, Acting - None, Entertainment - You'll be REAL happy when its over.

I don't know why everyone says this is a bad movie but they clearly have no taste. I've been watching this since I was a kid and it has a great story line and the actors are awesome as well!! I love it!

OK, so everyone's on here slating this movie and I just have to say, it's not that bad. It wasn't exactly my choice to go see this, but I thought I'd save my parents the pain and offer to take my little sister to go watch it. This film was actually surprisingly popular. MY friends wanted to see this (despite being sixteen) and my 14 year old MALE cousin went to watch this, with his girlfriend and friends of course. Well the start, despite these girls having a 'passion for fashion' they didn't half look a state, but the thought was there - I supposed. At times theplot seemed a little trivial and the singing, well lets leave it to the HSM lot next time. Despite this the heart of the film was in the right place. It had a strong message about sticking with your friends and showed the value of friendship. To be fair, this movie could have been Oscar worthy and still been slated, just for having the 'Bratz' tag. So despite what everyone seems to be saying by watching this film (and playing with the dolls) your children are not going to be brainwashed and filled with messages that they must dress like a hooker. If you watch this expecting it to be what it is, a movie for young girls about fun and friendship, then you won't be disappointed and neither will the young girlies in question.

This movie..... Was a cornucopia, an easter egg basket even, a bucket full o' American Stereotypes! Particularly with the characters. You could literally point every stereotype out within say 7 minutes of the movie. Let's start with....Yasmin: Your typical, American written "Mexican". One house, one family, 500 people.Sasha: Apart of your typical "African Anerican" family. Divorced parents, jumping between living at both parents houses. Parents wont speak to each otherCloe: Simple. Typical dumb, sporty, clumsy and ditzy, but amazingly gorgeous blonde.Meredith: Typical Blonde, Rich little "daddy's girl" who always has to have her way. And of course, leader of the Popular Group at school, with her brunette and ginger sidekicks. Oh yeah, also undeserving Student Body President. Yup, Daddy's the principal of the school.Jade: Typical Asian-American girl with strict mother who over burdens her with academic work, Jade has to act like she loves all of it, but has a secret rebellious side.If that doesn't scream American cultural movie character stereotypes, I don't know what does. And I found all of this out within I kid you not, less than 7 minutes of watching this movie.

If you missed the ridiculously shallow ego-trip of Hilary Duff "Material Girls" last year, don't worry, here's another shallow teen movie for you that steals so much from Mean Girls that it hurts. The movie is based on the ugly dolls with the same name with perfect bodies and lots of money - only in the movie, the blond girl doesn't have any money at all. But don't worry, when she really needs it (for a dress), her friends have gift certificates.Sure enough, no one would like to see a movie with a bunch of fat teens running around acting silly but did the movie have to star four slender girls with attitude problems? Because let's face it, these girls think that appearance is the most important thing in the world. They're seriously not much better than their enemy - Meredith. And by the way - how did the word 'brat' become a positive word? For me it's still a very negative word meaning that your parents have spoiled you.Bratz doesn't want to give its core audience (small girls) a good message. It wants them to realize how important fashion and appearance is - and if you have an ugly outfit on - always make sure to keep a fashion emergency kit with you. Ugh.

Let me be clear here first of all: I'm in my twenties, and I saw Bratz, but not for any kind of simple lewd intentions at gawking at sexy teens in gobs of make-up and slutty clothes. My intentions were a little more pure, on a movie-geek level. Or rather, I went in with the expectation that it *would* be a bad movie, and even one that would go to such ridiculous lengths as to be awesomely bad, to the level of something like Ghost Rider, where taking it seriously would provide brain damage, and by not would give some form of entertainment (especially if you have friends to make jokes with during the movie, which for something like Bratz isn't inappropriate to 'ruin' for the rest of the audience). It's a staggering, warped view of high school life, the connections made in 'cliques' and social order, and about the bonding between girls who can't get enough of talking to each other through their web-cams. It also has enough montages to kill a few horses, Jon Voight with not only a prosthetic nose but a statue of his head with the same fake nose, a fluffy dog who gets beauty treatment along with her owner, a mariachi band that lives at the house of the Hispanic girl of the Bratz (and, for some reason, this doesn't seem too out of place, especially when they show up at talent shows), and...Jesus, did I mention the montages?But for all of this, if one is in the right frame of mind, it's hilarious, even achingly and hysterically, funny material, whether it was intentional or not. Frankly, I'm sure that the filmmakers didn't quite know what they were doing outside of making a big long commercial with the intellectual value of Tropicana fruit punch. But on those levels it almost works at times at looking like an unintentional satire; what is one to make of the symbolism of the heightened security at the high school envisioned by the school emblem and trophies: a hand holding an ax, with little figures holding the axes all over the school in one form or another? It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer-leading, one science, and one journalism/singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one-note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16.Maybe if you're already quite a young girl, seeing this movie might not matter too much in the grand scheme of things as far as real psychological impact. But at the same time if one were to look objectively, Bratz's message is a little scrambled and quite off in any positive aspect. Does one stick with friends or act individualist or, um, like, go into another clique or another table? How about staying fashionable, in the glammed up style that the girls go to lengths to do- leading up to, of course, the Bratz mobile that they walk out of to the climactic talent show- even in the face of peril? It really doesn't serve any artistic integral purpose whatsoever either. So, in the end, it works best as a so-bad-it's-still-bad-but-uproarious treat for those who gorge on works that slip by in pop culture that are so sapped with the vigor of commercialism that to read through the mixed messages would take a pot of coffee and a fine-toothed comb. But along the way, it's got montages, and songs, LOTS of songs- which are, as one might imagine who doesn't listen to Radio Disney, the worst trash possible right now. Brattitude!!

i went to go see this movie with my friend when we were bored (it just so happened to be the movie's opening night). even though we're in high school, we were expecting to find something that we'd be able to watch, but instead we found ourselves laughing hysterically at every single word that came out of each character's mouth. we certainly enjoyed it, but not in the way i believe the film makers were intending.neither of us went into the movie with high expectations, knowing that it was a film based on hideous dolls that neither of us had played with in years, but we were at least expecting some sort of plot line! the storyline jumped all over the place, beginning with the girls entering their freshman years, then all of a sudden it flashes "two years later", and we're supposed to believe they're juniors, even though they look exactly the same and have no physical change whatsoever.also, there were too many things going on at once, from a sweet sixteen party from a girl who has already had one, to a talent show, to a deaf boy who can happen to hear a girl sing.the girls in the movie, although beautiful, seemed to lack something that would make their performances believable. we were giggling at the dialoge and trying to gasp what message the movie was trying to send to young girls. we came to no conclusion, and i believe that we never will.

Had I not been forced to see this film because of my occupation (and the fact I have two young daughters), I would have avoided this particular production like Richard Simmons avoids women.However, no such luck came my way on this night, and I was subjected to one of the single most shallow, insignificant, poorly-directed, badly-acted movies of the year.Or in ANY year, for that matter."Bratz, The Movie" is supposedly based on those slutty-looking dolls with huge eyes, full lips and no noses; figures which many parents feel imbues their daughters with an overinflated infatuation with clothes, shoes and make-up.

Aaaaaaauuuugh!!!! This movie was so awful it makes me wish I had been struck blind and deaf as a child! I watched it with 2 friends, to try for an MST3K style viewing but.... it doesn't work!!!

I was just reading some comment before i decided to make my own, this guy honestly believes this film deserves a 10/10 rating. Yes that's right, according to this guy the film Bratz is a perfect masterpiece with impeccable acting, dialogue and story, backed up by Oscar worthy directing and screenplay. At least that's what a film with a 10/10 rating should be. Bratz is not. This is possibly the *worst* film i have ever seen. This film does not even deserve a 1/10 it is that bad. Im not trying to spite this film, i am honestly speaking my feelings for this film here, i have never felt more insulted, never have i cringed so much in a film and i actually felt embarrassed by some of the scenes i have had the misfortune of watching.Stay away from this film at all costs. It will scar your brain forever.

Well...first off..just why. If the intention of writing this film was simply because the last time a movie has been this cringe-worthy was Britney Spears' Crossroads, then the idea was a nail hit directly on the head.If you feel any emotion, be it happiness, joy, elation or even sadness (in context to the film, as opposed to its existence) during the running time of this film, you are unfortunately a biased person...or are 2 years old, in which case you would not have the mental capacity to read this or form opinion throughout the film...except for when to soil yourself during its run time.The sad truth is that this film was surely doomed from the start.

No one, not even children, should ever have to set eyes on this abomination.The person who let this crap be released does not deserve to be involved with the movie industry.

So, my friends and I were searching on demand forever and couldn't find anything to watch. I see this film on the list, no idea what this movie is, but knowing well of the dolls. Thought it might be an animated movie or something else to keep us entertained. So I say "F*** it we're watching Bratz." and we did. It's a Saturday night and we are juniors in high school - our expectations aren't high.To start off, let me say that I know for a fact that this film was obviously in no way meant to be taken so seriously. I literally made this IMDb account just now simply to write this review for this movie. I see reviews of other members saying things like (a-hem), "No-one would in their right mind would write, direct and produce this film, under the impression that anyone would actually enjoy it except for toddlers...and, unfortunately, that peculiar clique...young girls who actually assume that they and there friends are actually Bratz.", or "If you really have to put "OMG" as an actual spoken line, then I think it's time to rethink your career", or even, "It makes high school seem like a horrible place full of cliques and a mean, prissy, "boss" figure that runs the whole school"My God. You people need to relax.We were all laughing hysterically the entire duration of this movie. This is literally one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen. But from the intentional overuse of predictable stereotypes of teen behavior/society in general, mixed with a good helping of cliché 'heartfelt' moments, we couldn't help from being amused.The budget was incredibly high. It is undeniably a very quality-made/high-end film (cinematography-wise). So in that sense its also pleasing to the eye. Very colorful. Lot's to look at.In comparison to a movie like Clueless, of course this film doesn't compare. But it is completely different. This is a movie about BRATZ DOLLS we are talking about. Bratz. As in, the child's toy. Expecting a Bratz movie to accurately depict high school life or common social interaction or whatever else you think it should have, is mad.However I do know that this is a film I will never forget.I will always have these fond memories of watching this astonishing film with my friends on a Saturday night. Being blown away by how outlandish it was, but enjoying it thoroughly as a fun movie night with friends.So let's chill out.

Pretty much all the reviews were negative so I'm here to shed some light. This movie was made with a 9-12 year old girl audience in mind. Bratz dolls were my favourite when I was little so of course, I bought this movie when it came out. I re-watched it last summer. I still love it. It has the same kind of ridiculousness you'd find in Mean Girls. It's cheesy but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I found the tunes really catchy (It's All About Me being my favourite). Many people are complaining but so what if they're all conventionally pretty, and like make-up and clothes? This is just a cute movie about friendship and standing out and being yourself. How could there be anything wrong with that? I agree many parts were unrealistic (adult freshmen and the whole seating chart thing), but with a young audience in mind (and a nostalgic teen audience), this movie is pretty good. There's really nothing much that's problematic in it. It's already a lot more racially diverse than other teen movie casts.

Okay, it looks like this film was created to do two things; Obviously, the first one is to give little girls another movie to add to their collection of princess/bubblegum memorabilia. The second one was likely to keep some of those girls off the street for at least two hours. For about a week, they (the makers) seemed to have accomplished both of those. On top of that, some parents decided to tag along because of the perception that is was good for the entire family... They couldn't have been more WRONG, because it seemed like a dumbed-down version of 'The O-C', written in a day care center. On top of that, girls who DO watch this film will be(or have been) convinced that they must be hip and cool to survive. In its time, the Bratz enterprise has killed more brain cells than a MILLION Coca-Colas. And there's NO upside to this film! It was long, stupid, slow, boring, obnoxious and incapable of keeping anyone's attention without using a weapon of some sort! I ask all you fine people, "WHAT DID ANYBODY SEE IN IT?!?!"

Bratz, based off the wildly popular line of dolls, is actually a much more tolerable film than the one I was expecting to be greeted with. Rather than a shallow, frothy, candy-colored stroll through ditzy women, inappropriate fashion, and immature circumstances, I received a mildly-entertaining, high-energy romp filled with attractive leads, all of whom at least carry their part with some semblance of conviction, acceptable, if scatter-plotted themes and ideas, and a pleasantly fun diversion through the world that sort of mimics our reality but still finds itself wholly trapped in cinema's, family-friendly kind of reality.Make no mistake, Bratz isn't really a good film and it wouldn't be the first thing I recommend your daughters see. However, for a film that concerns three teen girls who are obsessed with fashion and self-expression, we could've been handed a much more harmful piece of cinema. Even as a male child, I always wondered why so much outrage and hate was directed at Barbie, who predicated herself off of being a good-natured sweetheart, was always the subject of vehement feminist controversy while the Bratz doll-line went under the radar, with their skimpy attire, makeup-heavy faces, and distracting artificiality. You want to talk about giving young girls the false sense of beauty and exercising the gender roles? The Bratz essentially were telling them not to leave the house without a tube-top, eyeliner, and eyeshadow.Bratz follows four lifelong best-friends - Cloe (Skyler Shaye), Yasmin (Nathalia Ramos), Sasha (Logan Browning), and Jade (Janel Parrish) - as they enter high school with an attitude to keep each other as close as possible. However, they are heavily burdened by the idea that the self-indulgent, wildly narcissistic class president Meredith Baxter Dimly (Chelsea Kane) wants to identify every student by what clique they should belong to, forcing nothing but social segregation in the already ominous halls of high school. Of course, Meredith finds the free-spirited girls disgusting and offsetting to her plan, but finds little to worry after two years of high school.Yes, by junior year, the lifelong friends have become nothing but faces in crowded hallways to each other, drifting towards their own sort of cliques, falling victim to Meredith's plan to keep all students part of their own little class of people. Cloe becomes invested in soccer, Sasha becomes a gifted and determined cheerleader, Jade embraces her inner-scientist with the chemistry club, and Yasmin sort of watches it all happen, while quietly participating in journalism. Yet the girls are brought together by four colossal, incredulous misunderstands at lunchtime, which reminds them that they have fallen prey to Meredith's system. Upon reuniting the group to prove that they can still be inseparable and devoted to each other, Meredith sets out to destroy the girls by recreating the party she threw for her sweet sixteen, making it even bigger and better, which she hopes will propel herself to the known voice of the school while the four girls wallow in their shame.I laud Bratz for at least doing what I never thought would be done in one of the most ostensibly shallow teen films of the last decade, which is etch some solid, vital commentary about high school into its material. While many films have addressed the abundance of cliques and groups in high school, Bratz recognizes the problem with it, which is that kids get the idea that they shouldn't be seen with kids of different cliques, which stunts their emotional and mental growth all the more. Yes, Bratz would be better if it didn't make the cliques so overblown and farcical that they tread the line of being part of a high school satire, but its acknowledgment of a real problem in a pleasantly real way is actually heartwarming to say the least.Then there's the abundance of singing, dancing, and just hanging out these girls do, which is surprisingly fun and enjoyable, given how shallow it sounds. These are teen girls being teen girls, minus the sarcastic and childish lingo utilized on contemporary kids shows like iCarly and Victorious, but also without the biting wit and commentary of something like Mean Girls, one of this particular's decades smartest teen films.Bratz essentially wants to be a flashier, more stylistically-potent Mean Girls, but its reliance on scenes that are too goofy and ridiculous to be taken seriously and its repetitive nature are what hinder it from living up to what it could be. The visuals are eye-popping, the music is catchy, if existing from the often forgettable subgenre of bubblegum pop that expires quickly, and the four leads are all charming with their smiley charisma and micro-mini fashionista sense, but the film simply has too much going on to really settle on a focus and it bogged down by scenes that are either not funny or heavy-handed in their moralizing. But the fact that there's moralizing in a film called Bratz, taken from the line of dolls that look the way they do, is surprising enough, giving the film much more leverage and likability than I could've ever imagined.Starring: Skyler Shaye, Nathalia Ramos, Logan Browning, Janel Parrish, and Chelsea Kane. Directed by: Sean McNamara.

Bratz is not a good movie. It has a lot of stereotypes. It was trying to be one of those chick flicks but did not achieve. The deaf representation is not good. Deaf people are not just all the way deaf. Deafness is a spectrum. Plus nobody would ever read lips that far lol. If you want to watch Bratz, I recommend watching the cartoon version (the superior)

Well, let me start off by saying this was the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. My friends and I went to see this movie BECAUSE this movie had been awarded a full zero stars in the Chicago Tribune (and several other places).The good things about this movie, is perhaps that the producers must have spent a lot of money hiring people and buying a lot of clothes. Some of the clothes were sure pretty cool, and if I were a girl, I'd probably wear them. One thing, is that I never understood when the phrase "Brat" ever became a good thing and how a high school teenager hitting on a 11 year old was ever a good thing.The movie included such insensitive material, and the idea is very unoriginal. This is not to mention that the other Bratz movie that came out on the 8th of August now number 1 on the bottom 100 of the IMDb list. I don't understand how the Asian girl, becomes the mathlete/science team superstar; the Latino bratz girl has tons of Latino people in her house all the time, INCLUDING a Mariachi band and she and her mom start singing that very popular song that... "la coucou-ra-cha"... you know what I mean... song. Oh, also the girl who is awarded the scholarship at the end of the movie... because she "needs it"... can afford to go shopping all the time and has a big house as well? I actually only enjoyed it BECAUSE it was so bad, and because some of the scenes in the movie were just so awkward and hilarious. negative 3 stars for being that awful.

Actually, almost everything. I normally don't comment on films I haven't seen all the way through, but since I currently work in a cinema and have had to endure snippets of this rubbish for the last couple of days I feel I have seen more than enough to comment on it.First off...walking through the auditorium doors at any point during this "movie" is like being battered repeatedly about the head by a deranged thug wielding a piece of two-by-four. You can literally feel your conscious mind sagging in defeat as the dreadful mindlessness of it washes over you. It really is a palpable thing.At no point that I saw did any of the lead girls display anything remotely like acting ability. They can't even be referred to as wooden, since the term "wooden actor" at least implies some ability, however dismal.All that this movie offers is the most pitifully superficial gratification for the absolute youngest girls. And all the movie seems to teach is that being superficial and shallow is the best way to "get on" in life.And what the heck is John Voight doing in here? At what point was he convinced that doing a teen movie based on a set of ugly, under-dressed and over made-up dolls was a good career move? I really pity people with small daughters...this movie must be the worst kind of hell for them. Parents....you have my commiserations.SUMMARY: Plot - Ronald McDonald, Acting - None, Entertainment - You'll be REAL happy when its over.

Rainer255 shot himself after 5 minutes of viewing Bratz.1st: The acting was horrible ranks of the girls Chloe being the worst every time something sad or embarrassing happens all she does is look down but not all the way. Who ever wrote the script should die it was completely cliché and horrible. No one says Dilio anymore!Why did it skip two years ahead? Yasmin I did not believe for a second she was Spanish everything she said in Spanish was common words my dog knows! What was her little brother who was like 14 hitting on that 11 year old.I was deeply disturbed that they all woke up at the same time looking "beautiful"(lesbians). Even more by the fact that they stop being friends so quickly than became again so easily. Ummm that deaf kid wasn't even deaf...when he first appeared I thought hey an interesting subplot...but I was wrong. The movie seemed to drag on forever there was like a 100 random montages/music videos going on I was so confused. This movie reassures me that future teens are going to be dumb pretty fashionable sluts.

As a teenager- I enjoy cheesy pre-teen films- just for the laugh. However, after I saw this- I felt violated. Girls at that age never say 'OMG' or 'BFF'. There is cheesy and just stupid! I also think it sends out a really bad message to pre-teens or younger girls; all these girls are too pretty and no one can be so popular and likable and it happens that they all get guys. I can't think of a worse film I've seen, and I've seen a lot of crappy films. The acting was rubbish and the actresses who are supposed to be 16 or 17 actually look like they are 30! And what I hated most of all was how unrealistic it was; it just happened that they could all sing, dance, and bake! And it so happens that they are all pretty. Whoever would watch this film more than once should be shot! Don't watch it unless you want to waste two hours of your life...

I don't know why everyone says this is a bad movie but they clearly have no taste. I've been watching this since I was a kid and it has a great story line and the actors are awesome as well!! I love it!

I genuinely think it's a good movie, it's got a below average plot and the acting is from about E-list actors, but there's something really nice about it, it's really quite nostalgic for me and the fact I could relate with this when I was younger, idk but generally it's really appealing and although it's got shitty reviews, it's on Netflix and Lovefilm, won't cost you any extra but I do recommend it. The film in itself is about 4 girls who are completely different however, they still have a close bond, but as they go through school they get split apart by the things they like and within two years, they've almost forgotten each other. They vow to change however it's difficult and that's all I'm really gonna say, it's pretty corny but it's not bad once every so often, eh?

OK, so everyone's on here slating this movie and I just have to say, it's not that bad. It wasn't exactly my choice to go see this, but I thought I'd save my parents the pain and offer to take my little sister to go watch it. This film was actually surprisingly popular. MY friends wanted to see this (despite being sixteen) and my 14 year old MALE cousin went to watch this, with his girlfriend and friends of course. Well the start, despite these girls having a 'passion for fashion' they didn't half look a state, but the thought was there - I supposed. At times theplot seemed a little trivial and the singing, well lets leave it to the HSM lot next time. Despite this the heart of the film was in the right place. It had a strong message about sticking with your friends and showed the value of friendship. To be fair, this movie could have been Oscar worthy and still been slated, just for having the 'Bratz' tag. So despite what everyone seems to be saying by watching this film (and playing with the dolls) your children are not going to be brainwashed and filled with messages that they must dress like a hooker. If you watch this expecting it to be what it is, a movie for young girls about fun and friendship, then you won't be disappointed and neither will the young girlies in question.

This movie..... Was a cornucopia, an easter egg basket even, a bucket full o' American Stereotypes! Particularly with the characters. You could literally point every stereotype out within say 7 minutes of the movie. Let's start with....Yasmin: Your typical, American written "Mexican". One house, one family, 500 people.Sasha: Apart of your typical "African Anerican" family. Divorced parents, jumping between living at both parents houses. Parents wont speak to each otherCloe: Simple. Typical dumb, sporty, clumsy and ditzy, but amazingly gorgeous blonde.Meredith: Typical Blonde, Rich little "daddy's girl" who always has to have her way. And of course, leader of the Popular Group at school, with her brunette and ginger sidekicks. Oh yeah, also undeserving Student Body President. Yup, Daddy's the principal of the school.Jade: Typical Asian-American girl with strict mother who over burdens her with academic work, Jade has to act like she loves all of it, but has a secret rebellious side.If that doesn't scream American cultural movie character stereotypes, I don't know what does. And I found all of this out within I kid you not, less than 7 minutes of watching this movie.

Firstly, not sure if there are spoilers here (or even if anyone will care), but better to be safe. Of course this is assuming that anyone else would actually pay good money to see this - and that I seriously doubt.My daughter aged 9 adored it; I (aged 42) merely sat open mouthed in disbelieving horror. I am a mother; and let me tell you if I was as straight laced as the mother of (I think her name was) Jade, then I would NOT smile and laugh as a 2 year deception of my daughter dressing like a tart the minute she reached school was revealed to me in an auditorium full of hundreds of people. Grounding until she died and then grounding of her ghost would be more my style.I have to say with hindsight it was so bad it was good if you see what I mean; I laughed most of the way through it - even at bits I don't think I was meant to. The emergency make up and sewing kits, not to mention the baking bit was a scream and I laughed hysterically. They had dress making skills that the likes of Vera Wang would kill for, make up skills that would win them an Oscar (and the only way they're ever likely to see one in this lifetime) and finally cooking skills that would make Gordon Ramsey weep (though I doubt it would be with pride).The overall message ( if there was one, and I'm clutching at straws here to ensure I haven't wasted 2 hours of my life that I won't get back) is that you should stay true to your real friends and not any cliques (although in the end they became their own 'bratz' clique surely?) Still its over - I came out alive and with my brain (relatively) intact, and the sure and certain knowledge that 'bimbo' is a word the four girls playing the main roles should really get used to hearing (particularly after watching an interview with the four 'actresses' - trust me, they were NOT acting in the movie!) The saddest part of the whole experience for me is that I witnessed three girls taking each other's pictures with the cardboard advertising stand in the foyer as we left - what was creepy is that they seemed like the English versions........

This film was doomed to fail from the start. I mean, c'mon, a film based on little sexualized urban "Barbies"?!?! Its just amazing what Hollywood would do to make a quick buck out of this derivative piece of uninspired pretentious "image conscious" POS. The main "characters" are just clones of those from yesteryear of film. Put simply, this film just plain sucks. IT SUCKS!!! John Voight, has, up to this point, belittled himself to the detriment of himself...literally. What actor would star in this? Is it for the money or to push up against these "beampoles"? The main idea of this film is image, just what perception of image as laid out in this film is anyone's judgement.Little kids or fans of these "Urban Barbies" may like this film for its "merit" but only from a kid's point of view. Adults, please take heed and do your best to try and wipe this film's existence from your mind. Like Morpheus said to Neo in the Matrix: Free your mind.
