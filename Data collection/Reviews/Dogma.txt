I can understand how this film would offend a lot of folks, Catholics in particular. I'm Catholic myself, and I think you almost need that perspective to be 'in' on some of the characters and humor in the story. Though I do find the excessive use of the 'F' word to be off-putting and tasteless, I think there was the germ of a good idea presented here with the suggestion that God can be appreciated better as a thoughtful and loving Deity than a harsh and demanding one. I mean, even George Burns thought so when he took on the role. That business about the plenary indulgence loophole was kind of a brilliant stroke, but I don't think God would allow himself to be taken in that easily by the kind of argument posited by the story's main premise. But hey, nice try on the part of writer and director Kevin Smith, who's role as Silent Bob can be appreciated for the fact that he actually does say something from time to time. If there's a major downside to the picture it would be that hideous excremental creature concocted for the lowest common denominator movie fans. That could have been left out and the picture wouldn't have suffered a bit. As for the choice of Alanis Morrisette as 'God', well, by that time in the story I think there was a point to be made about the whole concept of God and religion, and that the question of the Infinite is just a bit too much for any individual to contemplate and understand, so go with an interpretation you can be at peace with. After that, just say a prayer.

It is not often that you get to see a group of stars that you like in a funny movie that also makes some interesting points.Matt Damon (The Bourne Ultimatum ), Linda Fiorentino (Unforgettable). Severus Snape, Jay and Silent Bob, Salma Hayek (Frida), George Carlin, and, of course, God (Alanis Morissette), all join to make this irreverent and funny movie.The premise is so interesting, and the fact that it is set in New Jersey is so appropriate, whether intentional or not. As a recovering Catholic, I remember the teaching of the church that I could basically sin all I want, but if I repent at the end, I will be saved and go to heaven. New Jersey is reputedly the home of many undesirable criminals with vowels on the ends of their names - maybe some of them even relatives of mine - and I know they are predominately Catholic. I am sure they are counting on this "escape clause," just as Loki and Bartleby were counting on the same thing.Yes, while I was laughing, I was also carefully looking at the images {the golden calf (money) we worship} and listening to the lines. There is a wealth of material in this movie and it was thoroughly enjoyable.One to see again and again.

In Kevin Smith's world there are Angels among us, they blaspheme, kill and covet – by my reckoning three of the Big Ten – perhaps Kevin thought 7 outta 10 ain't bad? They also look like the guys from Good Will Hunting! These two angels, Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) were cast from Heaven for things un-Angel-ly, though they believe they have discovered a loophole that will allow them access back to heaven, and they have 4 days to get to New Jersey to exploit it.The problem there is that existence itself is based upon the principle that God is infallible, and proving him wrong in any way disproves that, meaning existence itself won't exist.So every man and his Dog(ma) from both "sides" (you know up above and down below) are intent to either allow these two misguided Angels passage in order to create chaos or prevent them from f*cking up the nice gig we humans have down here.The finer points of the plot don't matter here – suffice to say that the Church trying to get hipper and more accessible is a factor – what really drives the film is that the theological backdrop provides Kevin Smith's many characters with a setting where his dialogue sounds more plausible, even with all the unnecessary and extraneous formal touches that no-one aside from he and his characters use in everyday life. But Angels, Demons and Apostles probably do (not sure if I need capitals there but I'd hate to p*ss off the Church!).With the big G-(wo)Man being laid up and unable to step in it is up to his staff to prevent this unholy act.Bethanie (Linda Fiorentino) is the initially unwilling human charged with the ultimate responsibility by the Metatron AKA voice of God (Alan Rickman), Rufus is the formerly unknown 13th Apostle (who proves his authenticity by stating that Jesus "still owes me twelve bucks!"), and Smith faves Jay and Silent Bob are essentially escorts along for the rise – and to provide much of the potty humour.On the "Red" team are Azrael the demon (Jason Lee) and a few teenaged minions.The ludicrous and way out setting is perfect for Kevin Smith to work with, being a pet project he obviously spent a great deal of time coming up with a plot that while far-fetched hangs together and is plausible in an impossible way. The script is often clever, the dialogue better than anything he has written since and there is lots of detail along the way that shows the time spend fine tuning the small things.But with the good comes the not so good – though Smith thankfully keeps his indulgences minor – there are still various comic book references, a myriad of 80s references and wink-wink cameos, but it must be said they do all work or at least not detract from the good stuff.And finally what other film can say that they have Salma Hayek as a stripper (I could give you 20 paragraphs on that 90 second scene alone!), a Sh*t-Demon, and who could forget the mass murder of fast food chain senior management topped off with the slaughter of hundreds of New Jersey-ites? (Unfortunately this was made before Jersey Shore so they weren't able to kill off the unbearably untalented Snooki – that might be a job for a Terminator in the future.) I think Clerks remains Kevin Smith's best film and Chasing Amy is his most accomplished, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was the film he was most satisfied with, after all he managed to tick most of the "Kevin Smith Bingo TM" categories off (potty humour, 80s references, cameos, a cast of his familiars, drug references, Jay and Silent Bob, comic book parables etc) AND deal with his own religious questions at the same time, in a film that works quite well as a straight comedy – albeit of the dreaded controversial type – but even without the dick jokes (or lack thereof where Angels are concerned) the script is interesting enough that Dogma would be worth watching.Of course if you are reading this and want me to address the film from a religious perspective – you're wasting your time. It's just a movie, a good movie dealing with religious themes, but still JUST A MOVIE! Final Rating – 8 / 10. Smith should go back to writing his own stuff about things that matter to him, anything else could be perceived as a Cop Out, which wouldn't be good.

"Dogma" isn't the kind of comedy that most people will find themselves holding onto their guts during. It's more the second-long "ha!" kind of comedy.That simply means Kevin Smith's writing is clever enough to the point where you will be pleasantly shocked by some of the conversations and events of the film and think it all rather amusing and humorous. It's not hilarious, it's just clever and a bit funny.The premise is rather interesting and surprisingly from a more fantasy-esquire genre than Smith traditionally dabbles with. Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are more or less fallen angels that have found a way back into heaven. They must be stopped or the world will come to a screeching halt, so a seemingly random protagonist named Bethany gets charged by God to stop them. Simple, but the slick, nonchalant approach to religion keeps the satire rampant.The film does spend a lot of its time explaining itself, which isn't too bad considering Smith keeps the explanations to-the-point and allows the characters to stay interesting in the process. Chris Rock, who plays an apostle, and Alan Rickman, who plays God's messenger/ voice are two of these characters that are both good in the film and Smith has allowed to maintain their character's edge despite lines upon lines of explanation.Getting from point A to point B and so on is not the film's strength. The physical events that take place are ultimately boring and unexciting. It's the moments along the way, the conversations and the philosophy that come about, that make it successful. Affleck's character raises a lot of interesting religious questions about humanity and his conversation with the protagonist on the train is rather insightful. In general, Smith has used Bethany as a way to keep the viewers skepticism of the plot active in the film. She keeps it from getting preposterous. In general, the whole cast is very talented and their characters well written, which keeps the film interesting.It's not the funniest or most interesting comedy in terms of plot and the sequence of events, but "Dogma" is a smart concept that ultimately results in a sharp satire and some great thoughts that scrutinize religion in a way that never seems too out of line.

I always thought the phrase, "I laughed until I cried," was just an oxymoron. Until it happened to me. I watched Dogma: the funniest movie I have ever seen. The movie seemed designed specifically for my warped sense of humor. It was an incredible mesh of the high-brow and the low-brow.It had one character who was extremely foul-mouthed, and kept making up hilarious obscene phrases. It also had a lot of perceptive, biting (and very funny) theological and social commentary.For me, it was sort of like being tickled hard in the ribs for about an hour. When I reached the breath-taking climax of the film, the resolution was such a shock and was so unexpectedly emotional and I was so sore from all the laughing, I actually burst into tears. Now, dammit I am a grown man. I never do that. Not even for anything real, much less a movie. But it happened.

This is a cleverly constructed movie with wits to it. I like some Kevin Smith movies, some of them I just don't I however enjoyed this one. I didn't particularly found this movie to hilarious or anything like that, but like I said it does have wits. It might offend certain Christians that take things way to hard, but for others they might find the movie to have close to the right amount of balance to it (what I mean is, it didn't really seem like it tried to step over the line). The cast were all great and each of them brings something to the table. This is more than a journey movie about getting from point A to point B to accomplish a mission. But more so on the interaction between the characters that adds to it's humor and wits. It just seemed like Kevin Smith put a lot of his own thoughts and philosophies about Christianity into this. Which he does in a lot of his movies, excluding the Christianity part. It's a intriguing movie that some Christians may agree with and others will disagree with but most will at least will be intrigued with. It's a movie with cleverly constructed satire that takes on more of the modern street angle to Christianity. This had potential to be better if it had more exploration on intellectual parts and how to expand on that. Even if the overall plot doesn't make much sense when it comes to God. But maybe I am just being a bit nit-picky. Overall this is a movie that the audiences could have a entertaining time with, even the Christian audiences if not taken way too hard. It might offend the Catholics though.7.3/10

I was fairly unsure about watching this because religion used to be a big part of my life. But not five minutes into it, my worries were nullified and I couldn't stop laughing. The plot is wholly original and pretty gutsy, but Kevin Smith is a good director and did a wonderful job with it. The entire cast is perfect, with Alan Rickman being my personal favorite. The things brought up in the movie were really interesting and a lot of fun, and even the parts that should have offended me were clever. While it wasn't that "complete" in terms of explaining things, it was still definitely worth watching. I would even go so far as to call it the religious version of "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Honestly, the only parts I didn't like were the Golgotha and the crappy CGI wings. (The CGI gets a pass because this was made in 1999, but I'd love to see it get remastered.)

I was fully expecting Alan Rickman to walk away with "Dogma", even with such an impressive cast. And he comes close. But what I absolutely did not see coming was just how funny Jay is in this movie. I've always preferred Silent Bob, but Mewes is a riot. This isn't my favorite of the View Askewniverse. It's long-winded and the incessant conversations on scripture mythology get old. You can tell Kevin Smith was exorcising some self-doubt here, but by the time the gang gets trapped in the bar, I'd mostly checked out. I can't hate on a movie that's given the world Buddy Christ, but at a certain point, I was missing that first half pretty hard.6/10

While both funny and frightening, this film is more than just a comedy with gratuitous violence and (bad)-language.  It's a theological reflection...and a call to the Church to focus on things that matter (like living life to the fullest, helping those in need, honoring and respecting all, expecting respect in return) rather than those that don't (like...well, dogma [doctrines/church laws] or any belief that causes us to "draw a line in the sand," condemning to hell or perdition any who disagree with us).  As I watched it (the first and all subsequent times), I felt sure that the movie was written by someone who really loves his church -- but is smart and aware enough to recognize its shortcomings, its blindspots, even its failures and hypocrisies.  Rather than simply leaving or ignoring or dismissing it, Smith chooses to enter into dialogue with it, using the potent medium of film to do so.  One can only hope that the church--not just Roman Catholic but all branches of it-- takes him up on his call to conversation.
Not to be missed in the film, on a lighter note, are the introductory disclaimer and the "Thank Yous" at the end.  Smith thanks Elaine Pagels, for God's sake -- who knew anyone in Hollywood read contemporary, feminist theology?  What a welcome revelation....

For a comedy with a little action and suspense, this show rocked. I had a great time with this film and enjoyed the well thought out characters and ideas explored. Strange to think that people actually "picketed" the show. Though, if you check out the news of the time this show was released, then you will find an America that protested at the drop of a hat over many various issues from the monumental to the mundane. Protesting was akin to joining a health club or starting a new diet. Regardless, this show still pierced through the murky haze of blind aggression with its following in the DVD release. Check out the flick that continues to march with its unintentional status, and reminds us all how silly people can be when mob justice rules.

I have always loved Kevin Smith's style of directing and this film has re-affirmed my belief that he is one of the top directors in the film industry at the moment. Dogma's topic was a very sensitive one and could have been misused but Kevin Smith has dealt with the subject perfectly. Anyone who has critisized Dogma for being offensive has really not understood the film. Dogma is full of excellent moments, not least Alanis Morissette who I thought was fabulous in her small but important role as 'God'. All the performances were excellent and the actors complimented each other superbly. Overall this film has a mixture of everything and its underlying message is one which should reach everyone.

"Dogma" is a 1999 adventure comedy directed by Kevin Smith starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.
⚪
All in all, Kevin Smith's fourth directorial work ascends to comically celestial heights with hilariously decorated wings by combining doctrinal theology and dark humour to a weird yet fascinating road trip comedy that, despite its general silliness and a predictable plot, displays an extreme intelligence and knowledge about its sophisticated subject matter, and thanks to likable characters, effective side-blows and a script with love for detail, it becomes a strangely enjoyable and meticulous twist on the biblical movie genre that knows to mock as well as respect the themes it deals with.
⚪
After the previous film has been nothing short of a total catastrophe, I really hoped that Kevin Smith's next film would be much less offensive, insulting and uncomfortable to watch. Well, it is in fact much less awkward to watch, but I cannot really deny that it is less insulting to some, for it is an absolutely dark comedy about religion, Christian teaching and Armageddon. However, unlike his last feature, this one surprisingly displays a lot of intelligence, knowledge and, most importantly, respect towards the subject matter it deals with. What is this film even? Well, I cannot fully describe what it actually is supposed to be, but if I had to summarize it, I would say that this is the result of what would happen if you combined biblical spectacularity and comic book extravaganza to weird genre mix. Given that the writer-director is a professed fan of comics and was apparently raised a Catholic, it is no wonder that he seems to have comprehension about both aspects - unlike with his previous project. The result of this experimental undertaking is a naughty but nonetheless fascinating road trip movie that entertains with its basic premise as well as its dark humour. It displays a lot of respect towards religion and biblical values, but at the same time doesn't hesitate to point out the stupidity of some other aspects. Like, the main character, who turns out to be the last descendant of Jesus Christ is working at an abortion clinic that is constantly besieged by devout Catholics, and in another scene, it is revealed by one character that Jesus Christ himself was black and not white as everybody says. What makes it all so effective is that it exactly hits a sore point of many believers, and reportedly, it was successful, as the movie was later on protested against by the same people. However, since I am not really religious and can take dark humour, I had no problem at all with what is shown in here, quite the contrary, it was extremely fascinating. As mentioned above, Smith seems to know a lot about doctrine theology and hence knows to invent as well as to stage characters from the matter like superheroes. Next to the previously mentioned descendant of Christ, Bethany, we have the angel Metatron (brilliantly portrayed by Alan Rickman), the thirteenth apostle Rufus (who was never mentioned because he was black), a muse living on earth as a stripper, the mischievous Azrael, the two renegade angles Loki and Bartleby and, last but not least, two prophets - Jay and Silent Bob. Wait, what? Yes, exactly! Next to all the bible inspired characters you have your two favourite drug-dealing stoners accompanying the group with their abilities. Seriously, never ever have fictional characters been totally out of place and right were they belong at the same time. Together, they embark on an adventure to stop the boys from "Good Will Hunting", I mean, the two fallen angels from experiencing indulgence, thus proving that God is not infallible and inadvertently destroying existence itself. In the course of the film, Smith doesn't hesitate from calling attention to some valid points about the bible, for example why angels have no free will and humans do despite being his first creation, or that God in fact might be female or even that Jesus was no only child. There are so many ideas and legitimate discussions about it, that it is downright thought provoking, but even if it is mostly a great idea and a well-executed film, there is still one thing about it that bugs me a little. Most of the time, it shows the characters having sophisticated conversations about the total hilariousness of it, and once again it is so wittily written that it downright amazes me, but at the same time it affects the experience tremendously. Kevin Smith's love for detail and intention to satirize the whole subject results in a certain kind of uneventfulness. Like, the importance of each character is thoroughly explained and they are well-designed from start to finish, but considering how they are introduced, they all do comparatively little. They travel from Chicago to Jersey, arrive there and stop the angles - there isn't actually happening much more. It is kind of predictable, straightforward and proceeds without any major complications. I am not going to deny the ingeniousness behind it all, because it is seriously impressive, but at the same time the plot comes up short. In the end, it however tuns out to be an extremely enjoyable and intelligent experience. The characters are loveable, the cast is probably the most outstanding Smith was ever able to assemble, and the satire is wonderfully constructed. Also, Alanis Morissette plays God herself. How can you not love that idea? Weird, yet meticulously crafted and strangely fascinating.

Initially promising start with an interesting premise and a bit of inspired casting, DOGMA wanes immensely after the first thirty minutes. DOGMA commits the Hollywood version of mortal sin by taking itself way too seriously. Once the screenplay takes to this convoluted path, the humor screeches to an abrupt stop. For a motion picture that is supposed to take a farcical approach towards organized religion (namely Catholicism), it surely revels in its own inflated sermonizing. For a look at humorous takes on religion that's been done better, check out THE LOVED ONE (1965) or LIFE OF BRIAN (1979).

Another vote from a cradle Catholic who was not remotely offended by this movie. Not that some of the negatives mentioned by other posters here aren't true -- yes, a lot of the humor is gross, yes, the F-word is overused, yes, its criticism of organized religion is less stinging that you'd expect (though that in itself is a slightly foolish expectation, given that the writer/director is himself an active member of an organized religion). And yes, if you're not Catholic, much of the movie is a little foggy, under-explained, and not very engaging. That last one I definitely agree with; I seriously doubt whether I'd recommend the film to a non-Catholic at all.But, oh, God, I LOVED it, serious flaws and all!  It's a huge chaotic mess with about sixty different trains of thought and philosophy, from the ecstatic to the scatological, slugging it out for dominance, and in its very sloppiness there's a sense of anarchic, exultant wonder I've never seen in a movie before. The only two things like it that I can think of are Thornton Wilder's play "Skin of Our Teeth" and G.K. Chesterton's amazing joyous fever dream of a novel "The Man Who Was Thursday", both of which are works by people who may or may not have faith but who definitely have a good idea. Or several dozen of them, and who just run with them wherever they go. These works are big chaotic messes, but in that way they are mirrors of Creation, the mother of all big chaotic messes. In all these works, just as in the real world, love and joy and beauty and filth and cruelty and despair are constantly tumbling over and bleeding into each other; the one universal rule is that everything is absurd, that the human race is the most absurd thing of all, and that this absurdity can be the catalyst to either suffocating grief or a kind of hilarious wonder.If you go into "Dogma" expecting a trim and tidy theological comedy of manners, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for something with the same filthy gorgeous lunacy of existence itself, this is it.

I go to church and I find this movie very religious. I show it to children at my church's annual vacation bible school.

Bring back Matt Damon from the old days. Such a great film - I watch it once a year. The satire is totally on point here.

This is a clever, funny and thought provoking movie which needs to be seen by every person on the planet that has a sense of humour.
Alan Rickman steals the show (as to be expected) but all of the characters are incredibly well cast - almost like they were born to play the part.
Thanks Kevin Smith for writing such an outstanding movie which I can constantly recommend to others!!

This is not Kevin Smith's best piece of work. His script was not quite up to his usual standard, most likely because it wasn't based on the everyday life of normal people. Even so I still had plenty of laughs and loved the performance of God. If you like Smith's movies, your sure to get a laugh from this one.

I am a huge Kevin Smith fan and after seeing this film I can say that it was everything I hoped it would be, and a little bit more. It's extremely well written and directed. The film has the same great comedy we're used to from Kevin Smith, but he shows that he has another dimension that I don't think many people thought was there.Jay and Silent Bob have their biggest role so far. Jay has some of his laugh out loud funniest one liners yet. But what really makes this a great film is that it is genuinely thought provoking.There are religious people out there who will criticize this film as being anti religion, anti Catholicism, when it is anything but (well, a little anti Cathlic maybe). The central theme to the film is that there is a God, but not the God that most people know (or think they know) or believe in. The characters in the film are trying to get the message across that people have changed the original God, man has made God into the image they want him/her to be, made their own religious rules, rules that God never intended. From a strictly biblical standpoint, Smith is right on, which is not something that can be said about many films dealing with religion. And isn't that the entire point to Christianity, that it's based on the bible.

I can see a lot of Catholics triggering and I love it.

Linda Fiorentino, the star of this film, put on one of the very worst performances I have ever witnessed in any large budget American film I have seen.I also think Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, and Jason Lee were all pretty awful. Even Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith were no good in this one.The script is just terrible. I'm a big Kevin Smith fan, but almost every line in this one is cringe-worthy, and especially those said by Linda Fiorentino.The whole story is just a jumbled mess--it seemed very much made up on the fly as they went along.And wow is it long. And boring. And not even a little funny.This film seems to be trying to be a critique of organized religion on some level, and so, I want to make it clear that I am not saying negative things out of some loyalty to some religion. I'm not a religious nut--just the opposite. I'm completely nonreligious. Religion is the single strangest thing about humanity, to me.I have no understanding of any positive thing that's been said about this film. It is one of the very few films I have given a 1 rating to. I can't believe one of my favorite directors made something this awful.

SpoilersThis movie should have been a roaring success. To begin with, it had an inventive script.  From angels banished to Wisconsin, to a modern idol in the form of a golden calf cartoon character, to God's voice being to powerful for human ears and using a cynical intermediary angel, this plot has religious knowledge and wit to spare.  The swearing is overdone, but even them some intelligence shines through.It had an excellent cast, perfectly chosen and in general good at their parts.  Affleck, Lee, and Rickman are the best, but the others are more than passable.I blame the director's childish approach to his own material.  Rather than focusing on the available intellectual possibilities, he prefers to insert childish, profane, and sex obsessed supporting characters who detract from rather than add to the comic relief.  Additionally the pacing comes in jarring starts and stops.Still worth a look, but should have been an excellent film, not a so-so romp.

I can understand how this film would offend a lot of folks, Catholics in particular. I'm Catholic myself, and I think you almost need that perspective to be 'in' on some of the characters and humor in the story. Though I do find the excessive use of the 'F' word to be off-putting and tasteless, I think there was the germ of a good idea presented here with the suggestion that God can be appreciated better as a thoughtful and loving Deity than a harsh and demanding one. I mean, even George Burns thought so when he took on the role. That business about the plenary indulgence loophole was kind of a brilliant stroke, but I don't think God would allow himself to be taken in that easily by the kind of argument posited by the story's main premise. But hey, nice try on the part of writer and director Kevin Smith, who's role as Silent Bob can be appreciated for the fact that he actually does say something from time to time. If there's a major downside to the picture it would be that hideous excremental creature concocted for the lowest common denominator movie fans. That could have been left out and the picture wouldn't have suffered a bit. As for the choice of Alanis Morrisette as 'God', well, by that time in the story I think there was a point to be made about the whole concept of God and religion, and that the question of the Infinite is just a bit too much for any individual to contemplate and understand, so go with an interpretation you can be at peace with. After that, just say a prayer.

Simple, but the slick, nonchalant approach to religion keeps the satire rampant.The film does spend a lot of its time explaining itself, which isn't too bad considering Smith keeps the explanations to-the-point and allows the characters to stay interesting in the process. Chris Rock, who plays an apostle, and Alan Rickman, who plays God's messenger/ voice are two of these characters that are both good in the film and Smith has allowed to maintain their character's edge despite lines upon lines of explanation.Getting from point A to point B and so on is not the film's strength. The physical events that take place are ultimately boring and unexciting. It's the moments along the way, the conversations and the philosophy that come about, that make it successful. Affleck's character raises a lot of interesting religious questions about humanity and his conversation with the protagonist on the train is rather insightful. In general, Smith has used Bethany as a way to keep the viewers skepticism of the plot active in the film. She keeps it from getting preposterous. In general, the whole cast is very talented and their characters well written, which keeps the film interesting.It's not the funniest or most interesting comedy in terms of plot and the sequence of events, but "Dogma" is a smart concept that ultimately results in a sharp satire and some great thoughts that scrutinize religion in a way that never seems too out of line.

I always thought the phrase, "I laughed until I cried," was just an oxymoron. Until it happened to me. I watched Dogma: the funniest movie I have ever seen. The movie seemed designed specifically for my warped sense of humor. It was an incredible mesh of the high-brow and the low-brow.It had one character who was extremely foul-mouthed, and kept making up hilarious obscene phrases. It also had a lot of perceptive, biting (and very funny) theological and social commentary.For me, it was sort of like being tickled hard in the ribs for about an hour. When I reached the breath-taking climax of the film, the resolution was such a shock and was so unexpectedly emotional and I was so sore from all the laughing, I actually burst into tears. Now, dammit I am a grown man. I never do that. Not even for anything real, much less a movie. But it happened.

This is a cleverly constructed movie with wits to it. I like some Kevin Smith movies, some of them I just don't I however enjoyed this one. I didn't particularly found this movie to hilarious or anything like that, but like I said it does have wits. It might offend certain Christians that take things way to hard, but for others they might find the movie to have close to the right amount of balance to it (what I mean is, it didn't really seem like it tried to step over the line). The cast were all great and each of them brings something to the table. This is more than a journey movie about getting from point A to point B to accomplish a mission. But more so on the interaction between the characters that adds to it's humor and wits. It just seemed like Kevin Smith put a lot of his own thoughts and philosophies about Christianity into this. Which he does in a lot of his movies, excluding the Christianity part. It's a intriguing movie that some Christians may agree with and others will disagree with but most will at least will be intrigued with. It's a movie with cleverly constructed satire that takes on more of the modern street angle to Christianity. This had potential to be better if it had more exploration on intellectual parts and how to expand on that. Even if the overall plot doesn't make much sense when it comes to God. But maybe I am just being a bit nit-picky. Overall this is a movie that the audiences could have a entertaining time with, even the Christian audiences if not taken way too hard. It might offend the Catholics though.7.3/10

I was fairly unsure about watching this because religion used to be a big part of my life. But not five minutes into it, my worries were nullified and I couldn't stop laughing. The plot is wholly original and pretty gutsy, but Kevin Smith is a good director and did a wonderful job with it. The entire cast is perfect, with Alan Rickman being my personal favorite. The things brought up in the movie were really interesting and a lot of fun, and even the parts that should have offended me were clever. While it wasn't that "complete" in terms of explaining things, it was still definitely worth watching. I would even go so far as to call it the religious version of "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Honestly, the only parts I didn't like were the Golgotha and the crappy CGI wings. (The CGI gets a pass because this was made in 1999, but I'd love to see it get remastered.)

I was fully expecting Alan Rickman to walk away with "Dogma", even with such an impressive cast. And he comes close. But what I absolutely did not see coming was just how funny Jay is in this movie. I've always preferred Silent Bob, but Mewes is a riot. This isn't my favorite of the View Askewniverse. It's long-winded and the incessant conversations on scripture mythology get old. You can tell Kevin Smith was exorcising some self-doubt here, but by the time the gang gets trapped in the bar, I'd mostly checked out. I can't hate on a movie that's given the world Buddy Christ, but at a certain point, I was missing that first half pretty hard.6/10

I have always loved Kevin Smith's style of directing and this film has re-affirmed my belief that he is one of the top directors in the film industry at the moment. Dogma's topic was a very sensitive one and could have been misused but Kevin Smith has dealt with the subject perfectly. Anyone who has critisized Dogma for being offensive has really not understood the film. Dogma is full of excellent moments, not least Alanis Morissette who I thought was fabulous in her small but important role as 'God'. All the performances were excellent and the actors complimented each other superbly. Overall this film has a mixture of everything and its underlying message is one which should reach everyone.

For a comedy with a little action and suspense, this show rocked. I had a great time with this film and enjoyed the well thought out characters and ideas explored. Strange to think that people actually "picketed" the show. Though, if you check out the news of the time this show was released, then you will find an America that protested at the drop of a hat over many various issues from the monumental to the mundane. Protesting was akin to joining a health club or starting a new diet. Regardless, this show still pierced through the murky haze of blind aggression with its following in the DVD release. Check out the flick that continues to march with its unintentional status, and reminds us all how silly people can be when mob justice rules.

While both funny and frightening, this film is more than just a comedy with gratuitous violence and (bad)-language.  It's a theological reflection...and a call to the Church to focus on things that matter (like living life to the fullest, helping those in need, honoring and respecting all, expecting respect in return) rather than those that don't (like...well, dogma [doctrines/church laws] or any belief that causes us to "draw a line in the sand," condemning to hell or perdition any who disagree with us).  As I watched it (the first and all subsequent times), I felt sure that the movie was written by someone who really loves his church -- but is smart and aware enough to recognize its shortcomings, its blindspots, even its failures and hypocrisies.  Rather than simply leaving or ignoring or dismissing it, Smith chooses to enter into dialogue with it, using the potent medium of film to do so.  One can only hope that the church--not just Roman Catholic but all branches of it-- takes him up on his call to conversation.
Not to be missed in the film, on a lighter note, are the introductory disclaimer and the "Thank Yous" at the end.  Smith thanks Elaine Pagels, for God's sake -- who knew anyone in Hollywood read contemporary, feminist theology?  What a welcome revelation....

"Dogma" is a 1999 adventure comedy directed by Kevin Smith starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.
⚪
All in all, Kevin Smith's fourth directorial work ascends to comically celestial heights with hilariously decorated wings by combining doctrinal theology and dark humour to a weird yet fascinating road trip comedy that, despite its general silliness and a predictable plot, displays an extreme intelligence and knowledge about its sophisticated subject matter, and thanks to likable characters, effective side-blows and a script with love for detail, it becomes a strangely enjoyable and meticulous twist on the biblical movie genre that knows to mock as well as respect the themes it deals with.

After the previous film has been nothing short of a total catastrophe, I really hoped that Kevin Smith's next film would be much less offensive, insulting and uncomfortable to watch. Well, it is in fact much less awkward to watch, but I cannot really deny that it is less insulting to some, for it is an absolutely dark comedy about religion, Christian teaching and Armageddon. However, unlike his last feature, this one surprisingly displays a lot of intelligence, knowledge and, most importantly, respect towards the subject matter it deals with. What is this film even? Well, I cannot fully describe what it actually is supposed to be, but if I had to summarize it, I would say that this is the result of what would happen if you combined biblical spectacularity and comic book extravaganza to weird genre mix. Given that the writer-director is a professed fan of comics and was apparently raised a Catholic, it is no wonder that he seems to have comprehension about both aspects - unlike with his previous project. The result of this experimental undertaking is a naughty but nonetheless fascinating road trip movie that entertains with its basic premise as well as its dark humour. It displays a lot of respect towards religion and biblical values, but at the same time doesn't hesitate to point out the stupidity of some other aspects. Like, the main character, who turns out to be the last descendant of Jesus Christ is working at an abortion clinic that is constantly besieged by devout Catholics, and in another scene, it is revealed by one character that Jesus Christ himself was black and not white as everybody says. What makes it all so effective is that it exactly hits a sore point of many believers, and reportedly, it was successful, as the movie was later on protested against by the same people. However, since I am not really religious and can take dark humour, I had no problem at all with what is shown in here, quite the contrary, it was extremely fascinating. As mentioned above, Smith seems to know a lot about doctrine theology and hence knows to invent as well as to stage characters from the matter like superheroes. Next to the previously mentioned descendant of Christ, Bethany, we have the angel Metatron (brilliantly portrayed by Alan Rickman), the thirteenth apostle Rufus (who was never mentioned because he was black), a muse living on earth as a stripper, the mischievous Azrael, the two renegade angles Loki and Bartleby and, last but not least, two prophets - Jay and Silent Bob. Wait, what? Yes, exactly! Next to all the bible inspired characters you have your two favourite drug-dealing stoners accompanying the group with their abilities. Seriously, never ever have fictional characters been totally out of place and right were they belong at the same time. Together, they embark on an adventure to stop the boys from "Good Will Hunting", I mean, the two fallen angels from experiencing indulgence, thus proving that God is not infallible and inadvertently destroying existence itself. In the course of the film, Smith doesn't hesitate from calling attention to some valid points about the bible, for example why angels have no free will and humans do despite being his first creation, or that God in fact might be female or even that Jesus was no only child. There are so many ideas and legitimate discussions about it, that it is downright thought provoking, but even if it is mostly a great idea and a well-executed film, there is still one thing about it that bugs me a little. Most of the time, it shows the characters having sophisticated conversations about the total hilariousness of it, and once again it is so wittily written that it downright amazes me, but at the same time it affects the experience tremendously. Kevin Smith's love for detail and intention to satirize the whole subject results in a certain kind of uneventfulness. Like, the importance of each character is thoroughly explained and they are well-designed from start to finish, but considering how they are introduced, they all do comparatively little. They travel from Chicago to Jersey, arrive there and stop the angles - there isn't actually happening much more. It is kind of predictable, straightforward and proceeds without any major complications. I am not going to deny the ingeniousness behind it all, because it is seriously impressive, but at the same time the plot comes up short. In the end, it however tuns out to be an extremely enjoyable and intelligent experience. The characters are loveable, the cast is probably the most outstanding Smith was ever able to assemble, and the satire is wonderfully constructed. Also, Alanis Morissette plays God herself. How can you not love that idea? Weird, yet meticulously crafted and strangely fascinating.

Initially promising start with an interesting premise and a bit of inspired casting, DOGMA wanes immensely after the first thirty minutes. DOGMA commits the Hollywood version of mortal sin by taking itself way too seriously. Once the screenplay takes to this convoluted path, the humor screeches to an abrupt stop. For a motion picture that is supposed to take a farcical approach towards organized religion (namely Catholicism), it surely revels in its own inflated sermonizing. For a look at humorous takes on religion that's been done better, check out THE LOVED ONE (1965) or LIFE OF BRIAN (1979).

One of director Kevin Smith's better films, "Dogma" stars Linda Fiorentino as an abortion clinic worker who finds herself locked in a bizarre adventure featuring Jesus Christ's black disciple (Chris Rock) and two renegade angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon). The always disgruntled Alan Rickman co-stars as an always disgruntled henchman of Christ.Like Quentin Tarantino, Smith's films are packed with monologues, rambling conversations and incessant nods to pop-culture. Unlike Tarantino, Smith's films languish in the warm memory of teenage adventures, college humour and bizarre penis jokes. In "Dogma" these traits are elevated by some superficial but heartfelt attempts to grapple with theological issues (Smith is a devout Catholic). If the film ultimately fails as satire, it nevertheless works well as an odd slacker-movie. Affleck and Damon are devilishly riveting as a couple of murderous supernatural beings, and Smith regular Jason Mewes, a real life stoner, is hilarious as a foul mouthed dope-fiend. As Christian mythology is inherently nonsensical, "Dogma" can't help but be anything but reactionary. Smith's Christ may be a woman (Alanis Morisette) whose principles are antithetical to the corrupt organisations set up in her name, but her "mysterious ways" are still totally nuts.8/10 - Like him or loathe him, Kevin Smith was one of the more distinct voices of 1990s popcorn cinema.

An abortion clinic worker with a special heritage is called upon to save the existence of humanity from being negated by two renegade angels trying to exploit a loop-hole and reenter Heaven.This is a much-loved part of Kevin Smith's universe, with many people considering it his best film. For me, I always thought it was his worst. After the strongly-scripted trilogy of "Clerks", "Mallrats" and "Chasing Amy", suddenly we start getting some strange things like a giant poop monster. Really? That right there negates all the clever ideas you tried to add to the script.This is also the point in Smith's career where the budget was getting too big. The films got bigger than they needed to be and the casts got more famous. And why? This did nothing to improve the core of Smith's work, which does not succeed on larger scales.

Another vote from a cradle Catholic who was not remotely offended by this movie. Not that some of the negatives mentioned by other posters here aren't true -- yes, a lot of the humor is gross, yes, the F-word is overused, yes, its criticism of organized religion is less stinging that you'd expect (though that in itself is a slightly foolish expectation, given that the writer/director is himself an active member of an organized religion). And yes, if you're not Catholic, much of the movie is a little foggy, under-explained, and not very engaging. That last one I definitely agree with; I seriously doubt whether I'd recommend the film to a non-Catholic at all.But, oh, God, I LOVED it, serious flaws and all!  It's a huge chaotic mess with about sixty different trains of thought and philosophy, from the ecstatic to the scatological, slugging it out for dominance, and in its very sloppiness there's a sense of anarchic, exultant wonder I've never seen in a movie before. The only two things like it that I can think of are Thornton Wilder's play "Skin of Our Teeth" and G.K. Chesterton's amazing joyous fever dream of a novel "The Man Who Was Thursday", both of which are works by people who may or may not have faith but who definitely have a good idea. Or several dozen of them, and who just run with them wherever they go. These works are big chaotic messes, but in that way they are mirrors of Creation, the mother of all big chaotic messes. In all these works, just as in the real world, love and joy and beauty and filth and cruelty and despair are constantly tumbling over and bleeding into each other; the one universal rule is that everything is absurd, that the human race is the most absurd thing of all, and that this absurdity can be the catalyst to either suffocating grief or a kind of hilarious wonder.If you go into "Dogma" expecting a trim and tidy theological comedy of manners, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for something with the same filthy gorgeous lunacy of existence itself, this is it.

I go to church and I find this movie very religious. I show it to children at my church's annual vacation bible school.

This is a clever, funny and thought provoking movie which needs to be seen by every person on the planet that has a sense of humour.
Alan Rickman steals the show (as to be expected) but all of the characters are incredibly well cast - almost like they were born to play the part.
Thanks Kevin Smith for writing such an outstanding movie which I can constantly recommend to others!!

Bring back Matt Damon from the old days. Such a great film - I watch it once a year. The satire is totally on point here.

Dogma is firmly rooted in Kevin Smith's View Askew world so fans of his other films will not be disappointed. However, it also expands on the direction he took in Chasing Amy by dealing with subject matter and concepts that are personal and thought provoking. Dogma goes beyond the "dick and fart jokes", which are reassuringly present, and gives the viewer something to think about.The film deals with thoughts on religion, Catholicism mainly, in a way that pokes fun at the institution but does not deride it. Dogma is by no stretch of the imagination an anti-Catholic movie. It embraces religion and points out the potential and actual problems that can occur within any religious institution. The film's comments and contents are definitely meant to be taken with a grain of salt.The cast is great and there are many instances of hilarious viewing, usually Jay and Silent Bob, as well as very sensitive and expressive moments from the various actors.In the end, Dogma is a thoroughly fun and thoughtful viewing experience that both old and new fans will enjoy. A movie outside the typical fare that is worth spending your money on seeing.

This is not Kevin Smith's best piece of work. His script was not quite up to his usual standard, most likely because it wasn't based on the everyday life of normal people. Even so I still had plenty of laughs and loved the performance of God. If you like Smith's movies, your sure to get a laugh from this one.

I am a huge Kevin Smith fan and after seeing this film I can say that it was everything I hoped it would be, and a little bit more. It's extremely well written and directed. The film has the same great comedy we're used to from Kevin Smith, but he shows that he has another dimension that I don't think many people thought was there.Jay and Silent Bob have their biggest role so far. Jay has some of his laugh out loud funniest one liners yet. But what really makes this a great film is that it is genuinely thought provoking.There are religious people out there who will criticize this film as being anti religion, anti Catholicism, when it is anything but (well, a little anti Cathlic maybe). The central theme to the film is that there is a God, but not the God that most people know (or think they know) or believe in. The characters in the film are trying to get the message across that people have changed the original God, man has made God into the image they want him/her to be, made their own religious rules, rules that God never intended. From a strictly biblical standpoint, Smith is right on, which is not something that can be said about many films dealing with religion. And isn't that the entire point to Christianity, that it's based on the bible.

I can see a lot of Catholics triggering and I love it.

Linda Fiorentino, the star of this film, put on one of the very worst performances I have ever witnessed in any large budget American film I have seen.I also think Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, and Jason Lee were all pretty awful. Even Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith were no good in this one.The script is just terrible. I'm a big Kevin Smith fan, but almost every line in this one is cringe-worthy, and especially those said by Linda Fiorentino.The whole story is just a jumbled mess--it seemed very much made up on the fly as they went along.And wow is it long. And boring. And not even a little funny.This film seems to be trying to be a critique of organized religion on some level, and so, I want to make it clear that I am not saying negative things out of some loyalty to some religion. I'm not a religious nut--just the opposite. I'm completely nonreligious. Religion is the single strangest thing about humanity, to me.I have no understanding of any positive thing that's been said about this film. It is one of the very few films I have given a 1 rating to. I can't believe one of my favorite directors made something this awful.

SpoilersThis movie should have been a roaring success. To begin with, it had an inventive script.  From angels banished to Wisconsin, to a modern idol in the form of a golden calf cartoon character, to God's voice being to powerful for human ears and using a cynical intermediary angel, this plot has religious knowledge and wit to spare.  The swearing is overdone, but even them some intelligence shines through.It had an excellent cast, perfectly chosen and in general good at their parts.  Affleck, Lee, and Rickman are the best, but the others are more than passable.I blame the director's childish approach to his own material.  Rather than focusing on the available intellectual possibilities, he prefers to insert childish, profane, and sex obsessed supporting characters who detract from rather than add to the comic relief.  Additionally the pacing comes in jarring starts and stops.Still worth a look, but should have been an excellent film, not a so-so romp.
