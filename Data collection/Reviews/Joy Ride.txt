After Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) buys a car to pick up would-be girlfriend Venna (Leelee Sobieski) from college in Colorado, he learns that his brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn), was jailed on a misdemeanor charge in Salt Lake City. So he decides to pick up his brother first. During a pit stop, Fuller has a mechanic install a CB radio. They joke around with truckers, going so far as posing as a woman and setting up a false date with one. When the prank turns to tragedy, the trucker seeks revenge.For the most part, Joy Ride is an enjoyable horror/thriller. It is loaded with tension and it's easy for viewers to picture themselves in the scenario, as it's relatively realistic. The horror is formed from everyday situations, where just a couple bad decisions can lead one into the sights of a madman.However, I had to subtract two points for something I very rarely subtract points for--"stupid decisions" on the part of protagonists. Of course, some people think that horror films are primarily based on characters making stupid decisions, but in my view of the genre, even if such actions are clichéd, filmmakers generally justify such decisions at least in the context of the film. Too often in Joy Ride, writers Clay Tarver and J.J. Abrams, along with director John Dahl, make little attempt at justification. Why don't they just turn the CB off? Why don't they just ignore the villain? Why don't they call the police? Why don't they stay in places that are more populated (like the truckstop)? Why do they keep trusting the villain? While there are some cursory answers to a few of these questions, taken together, you keep wondering, "In the film's world, how can someone so stupid be in college?" One possible answer is suggested by the Joy Ride DVD. It contains a 29-minute alternate ending that thankfully has a bit of commentary from both the director and the writer. The alternate ending is just is good as the theatrical version, in my opinion, and tries to put a slightly more logical spin on the film. Our heroes do end up at a police station, with some police cooperation. However, it was apparently felt that this alternate (actually the original) ending "didn't work" and "didn't maintain tension". Abrams felt that involving the police more directly in the plot removed too much of the focus from our heroes. Dahl also states that he thought there was too much character development in the original ending. I beg to differ on all of those points. Although the revised ending has many positive aspects not found in the original--especially a Rube Goldberg-like scenario involving maximum, immediate risk and creating maximum tension, the original ending may have worked better overall in my opinion.But Joy Ride is good enough overall to transcend stupid decisions on the part of the characters. If seen as a sequence of high-tension scenarios, where logical plot connectors are only secondary to creating thrilling rides, Joy Ride almost deserves an A (a 9 in my rating system). There isn't a scenario in the film that's not smart and inventive in some way. The three principles--Walker, Zahn and Sobieski--give good performances, and the villain is masterfully done by Matthew Kimbrough (who provided the body), Ted Levine (who provided the bizarre, creepy voice), and Dahl, who wisely shows glimpses of him, but only glimpses. The villain is almost supernatural in his cleverness, strength and obsession. It's just too bad that we haven't had a sequel yet.

"Joy Ride" is an extremely entertaining road-set horror/thriller that was surprisingly quite good. The film is about Lewis (Paul Walker), a college coed who decides to buy himself a car and take off across the desert to pick up a would-be-girlfriend, Venna (Leelee Sobieski) in Colorado for a road trip together. He then learns that his older troubled brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn) has been arrested in Salt Lake City, so he picks him up on the way. After having a CB radio installed into the car, the two take off to pick up Venna, but end up pulling a prank on an anonymous trucker who goes by the name of "Rusty Nail" (excellently voiced by Ted Levine) on the CB radio. After the trucker learns about the prank, he attacks the brothers with his large semi, but they manage to escape. But soon after they pick up Venna, the menacing truck driver begins harassing them again, seeking revenge for the joke they decided to play on him - he'll stop at nothing to get it, and he's looking for more than an apology.Reminiscent of "The Hitcher" in quite a few ways, but also a much different film, "Joy Ride" was a surprise for me. I was expecting something along the lines of your typical teenage-horror fare, and I was pleasantly surprised with this intelligent and heart-pounding little thriller of a film. To start off, the story in itself is very nicely written and manages to avoid clichés. The characters in this film are smart, and the audience is rooting for them the entire way through. There are some excellently orchestrated thrill sequences, one of them being the really intense chase through the cornfield, among others, and these scenes are sure to get you on the edge of your seat.Tension builds slowly during the first 40 minutes or so, and from there it just goes rampant. The cast is led by Paul Walker, who hasn't accomplished anything too amazing, but manages to lead the film well and play his character believably. Steve Zahn in his quirky and funny older brother, and plays the part suitably. Leelee Sobieski plays the intuitive girl-next-door friend who ends up along for the ride, and she also gives a worthy performance. The psycho-trucker villain of the film is very scary, never really seen - we get to know him through the frightening conversations on the CB radio, where he makes numerous threats and has many disturbing confrontations with the group of friends. Ted Levine, who played the notorious Buffalo Bill in "The Silence of the Lambs" voices the psychopath, and his voice itself is creepy enough, and adds to the villain's overall demeanor. The ending was excellent, and I loved how ominous it was. I really didn't see it coming, and it concluded on a very unnerving note.Overall, "Joy Ride" is a superior action-filled horror/thriller that came as a big surprise to me. It was intelligent, tense, scary, and very well-written, which was nice because of my semi-low (no pun intended) expectations going into it. People who enjoyed "The Hitcher" will more than likely also enjoy this road trip from hell. Very well done and worth seeing for both horror and thriller fans alike. 8/10.

The idea of this movie is actually pretty good; two teenagers do a prank call on a CB radio, but the prank turns on them. Most teenagers have probably been in a situation where they themselves made a prank call. At the very least, everyone knows about it. The film has some excellent shocks throughout the movie, and all of the 'thrilling' sequences are very intense, sometimes bordering on the extreme. The plot is pretty good, even pretty original, as far as I know. The acting is good enough. The characters are believable and their actions are understandable, most of the time. The movie has some very good cinematography and some pretty good cinematic effects. The ending, though a bit far-fetched, was the perfect way to end it, in my opinion. I couldn't have imagined a better way to end it. I recommend this to pretty much any teen who enjoys thrillers, especially the ones who like to relate to the theme and plot. Nearly every teenager in the world can in some way relate to at least one of the main characters in this film. 7/10

Relatively a lesser known film which apparently spawned a few straight to video sequels. Joy Ride is a decent thriller with some suspense, although quite predictable at times.The film moves at a reasonable pace and doesn't drag on too much.The violence isn't gory or graphic and is quite tame for a film of this genre.One of the highlights of the film is most definitely the character of the villain trucker "Rusty Nail". Although we don't necessarily see him much (only briefly near the end and for a quick few seconds), it's his voice which strengthens the performance.Questionable scenes are regarding Rusty are how well he knew the friends. How he knew the roommate and was able to kidnap her. How he was able to pick back up the radio device and put it in their trunk. Nothing was exactly explained in the end.Paul Walker and Steve Zahn bring in solid performance showing a fun level of chemistry.Overall Joy Ride is a solid early 2000's teen/young adult type mystery thriller type. Yet expected a little more. It is relatively simplistic and somewhat forgettable.

This turned out to be one the few movies I liked that was geared toward a teen audience. Steve Zahn and Paul Walker weren't natural in the roles as brothers, which embodied the very nature of their relationship. While the story became rather convoluted near the end, Rusty Nail's voice and detached presence brought some actual fear to the heart of the viewer. While the sound editing made this film, the relatively simple yet complex plot really turned this film into a satisfying movie experience.

In "Joy Ride", two brothers (Zhan & Walker) get involved with a big rig driver over the CB radio while on the open road. They set him up as a practical joke and unleash all hell on themselves as the unseen subject of their prank,  known only as "Rusty Nail",  turns out to be a maniacal killer. "Joy Ride" is a well crafted thriller which methodically builds suspense while avoiding the usual gore and guts of horror flicks. With only a few plot holes, this thriller should keep most on the edge of their seats. Worth a look especially for those who enjoyed "Duel" (circa 1971) which is now circulating on cable.

After KILL ME AGAIN and RED ROCK WEST director Dahl has again made a nice good-looking, really thrilling little B-movie! He must have watched DUEL (which is still better, maybe the best S. Spielberg movie ever, and rates 10/10) and has added something here and there. The Trauma Spielberg handled in his movie is not to be found in here, but it's still and nevertheless a highly enjoyable, also well photographed movie with believable actors and a nice twisted ending (improbable, yes, but still nice). Whereas in DUEL one just had the man (Dennis Weaver is his best movie) and a truck (without the driver ever to be seen), Dahl added more characters and a more visible (actually audible) driver + police, etc, but the basic plot, people running away from mad truck/driver, is left intact. I just wish more such movies would still be made today ...

Joy Ride is a helluva movie. Basically an homage to Stephen Spielberg's 1971 made-for-TV classic Duel, it's the story of three young people being terrorized by a malevolent trucker.On his way to pick up his girlfriend from college, Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) stops to bail his loser brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) out of jail. They pass the time by taunting a trucker on their CB radio. Of course the trucker turns out to be a psycho who terrorizes them until they finally think they've appeased him by offering him their abject apologies. But once Lewis and Fuller pick up Lewis' girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski), things start right up again with increased intensity, and the realization that this isn't just any trucker. A sense of the uncanny and possibly the supernatural starts to pervade the film. The tension is cranked up until by the end I was literally gritting my teeth and squirming in my seat.This movie is smart, well directed, and scary as hell. My only complaint is that I really wanted Steve Zahn's character to die. Highly recommended. ***1/4/****

It is crazy how underrated this movie is. It is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. It is an excellent movie. I highly recommend it. I feel nervous every time I watch the movie.Paul Walker picks up his brother Steve Zahn from jail and they end up pranking a truck driver named Rusty Nail, he finds out, they reveal it was a prank, he doesn't take it too well, and mayhem ensues.The performances are great across the board but my guy Ted Levine's voice role is terrifying. He makes this movie terrifying. The tension is crazy throughout.Check this movie out. I'm a little mixed on the ending, but I will let you all decide for yourselves. Be well.

It is not a bad movie. It has enough excitement to make you sit it out. It's just another copy of same old, same old. The dialogues are pretty poor in my opinion, I can't remember enjoying one line in particular. The idea is old, done routinely. Guys pull a prank on some dude, a trucker in this flick, and the prankee is 'not amused'. The entire film is about the main characters being chased. No great special effects, no great acting, no great music score, no great nothin'. The sideline about the brother in prison is useless in my opinion, it serves no purpose. Television stuff. And yes, there is a possibility Joy Ride II will see the light.

This movie lacks of a crucial element one might call logic. The character development itself is fundamentally flawed, seeing as how there is simply none. The omniscient and omnipotent "psycho guy" is never quite explained. His motives are never clear, other than the "I'll make you guys pay!" The means of which he accomplishes his acts are never explicitly (or implicitly) stated either. Rather, everything must be assumed. This in itself would not be so bad, since the antagonist can stay hazy for the purposes of the plot. However, the protagonist (played by Paul Walker) is not much better in terms of getting a sense of the character. The opening scene depicts a dorm room with books haphazardly spread about. It is later revealed that he is at Berkeley on a full scholarship. This is what I have the most problem believing. Then why the hell is he such a dumbass? In fact, his brother and his friend are much of the same. For the most part of the movie, they run away screaming, nevermind the fact that they outnumber the bad guy three to one. They never think of picking up a weapon. And yes, they even meet the bad guy in a dark corn field in the middle of nowhere alone.For the greater part of the movie, I wanted the bad guy to catch them and torture them, resulting in slow, painful death. Whoever said the characters are real is either very stupid, or very stupid. I don't see how anyone can relate to the characters, unless the people they know have an IQ that rivals most rocks. Put aside the lack of character development and unbelievable plot devices, the director was quite effective at creating tension and conveying the fear of the characters. There were also some funny moments, most brought on by the hilarious Steve Zahn. The movie is really quite fun to watch, and the action (though brainless) delivers the appropriate thrills.

I went to "Joy Ride" with high expectations -- having enjoyed the work of Steve Zahn and John Dahl immensely in the past. But what I got was a poorly done by-the-numbers thriller with several numbers missing. "Joy Ride" is typical of movies these days that present a few good set-piece scenes but don't make them come together into a satisfying whole.The problem here is almost exclusively in the script. The villain is a chillingly evil, faceless trucker who is apparently omniscient. He knows everything about his victims -- who they are, where they are at all times, even where their friends are. But how? This omniscience is never even remotely explained and makes no sense. Without even this semblance of logic, the events in the film have little context and carry little punch. If the kids in the film were dealing with a maniac who, bad as he is, has to play by the same rules of reality as everyone else, and thus can be outsmarted, the film would have some point. As it is, it's just a series of scares that quickly becomes ho-hum.What a disappointing misuse of a great cast and a talented director.  Who green lights things like this?  I guess audiences are still going to see it, but they deserve much more.

Who does not think of this movie every time they pass a roadhog on the highway? How could you possibly not think of this? Like the woman from T2 who asks them if they want fries with their burgers. The tail light scene is priceless. Great chases, great suspense, only until the chick shows up does it start to lull and get boring but Rusty Nail is never far behind with his pink champagne. And of course, Ted Levine as the trucker's voice is unique as we all know. Dad used to watch it when he was alive. He loved it. Sad about Paul Walker. But yeah, nothing to really say except its a good movie and you think of it without fail every time you pass or a roadhog passes you.

This was a very good movie, full of suspense, but I hated the ending.. Maybe if they would show the bad guy's face it might have been better. I hope there is a part 2 so we can find out what happens in the end.. I gave the movie a seven but it could have received a nine if it would have ended with part one.

An intense action/horror/thriller directed by John Dahl that stars Steve Zahn (Stuart Little 2, Sahara), Paul Walker (2 Fast 2 Furious, Into the Blue), and Leelee Sobieski (The Glass House, Eyes Wide Shut).This movie is one of the most intense and most psychologically frightening movies ever made, that includes a shocking surprise ending. I'm surprised Wes Craven didn't direct this film, it would have been twice as scary. But John Dahl did a very good job. It is so freaky and so intensely strong that my heart kept racing. Each action/horror sequence kept eclipsing the last. Each thrill gets more thrilling and more shocking as time goes on. Joy Ride is a film everyone that's over the age of 12 will enjoy. I say 12 because it is extremely intense and there is some nasty violence in this film that might not be suitable for people under the age of 12.Without giving too much away, I can only say never buy a crappy forty dollar C.B. and prank call anyone you don't know. Bad things could happen. And believe me, this guy is very dangerous and does not like to be messed with, little do Lewis (Walker) and Fuller (Zahn) Thomas, and Lewis's girlfriend, Venna (Sobieski) know. Mwahahahahahahahaha!My tip...NEVER EVER PRANK SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW! Joy Ride is a weirdly named title, and yet it isn't. I think it partly isn't because I can't think of a better name for it, so, yet, I think it's a pretty good title.**** out of **** stars.10/10 Original MPAA rating: R: Violence/Terror and LanguageMy MPAA rating: R: Intense Sequences of Violence and Terror, Strong Language, and Male Nudity.My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes, Nudity

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Simple premise, very straightforward story that had lots of Intense suspenseful scenes that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Something that started off as benign joke between two brothers turns in a nightmare quick. I think the two leads did pretty good job & it's a distance amount of character development where you get invested just enough to genuinely care about what happens to them.(Lewis) is the younger brother but yet more mature & level headed as the older brother (fuller) inferior irrational one who seems like he's struggling to get his life together. The common misconception is that with age comes a level of maturity but that's not the case, But I love his enthusiasm through out the whole film & he had some non-intentional funny moments.I think the movies does a great job at not fully revealing the man identity in the truck, pretty much keeping it a mystery which adds to the eeriness .With that being said I do have some negatives to express about the film. Some directions they took wasn't logical like how was this man able to follow them around in the this era where we didn't have technology?? Was trying my hardest to make sense of it & the first conclusion I came up with was that he was able to trace them through the radio but at one point fuller threw the radio out the car 😭 so that left me puzzled. Or after the near death experience the first time why they ain't report it to the cops like this movie could've really been over in 46 minutes but of course they gotta figure out a way to keep the story going .

I loved watching Joyride. That's my kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend watching it, especially at night.

This was a dumb movie.  That the plot springs from a CB radio should have been a tip-off.  Do you know anybody who uses a CB radio these days?  You probably won't know anybody as dumb as the guys in this movie, either, because if you ever came across anybody like them, you would have run. They do dumb things, and then dumber things.  You're just saying, "Oh, no," all the way through it.The movie IS suspenseful so if that is what you are after, it won't disappoint there.  Just don't ask too many questions like, "How did she get here, or how would he have known that."  Suspend logic.

It would be very easy to overlook 'Roadkill' (the title 'Joy Ride' is known by here in Australia), especially considering the leads are mainly known for asinine teen movies. But dig a little deeper and you will see that it is directed by the underrated John Dahl, also responsible for the crackerjack thriller 'Red Rock West' a decade ago. Paul Walker ('The Skulls') is very effective as your average joe college kid, and Steve Zahn ('Out Of Sight') is even better as his smart ass older brother. Zahn is a talented comic often better than the movies he appears in, and he is in fine form here. The chemistry between the two is believable and amusing without becoming tired. Leelee Sobieski ('Eyes Wide Shut') has yet to make much of an impact on me, and there's very little to change that here. She is passable but little more than eye candy as Walker's potential love interest. The real star of the movie is the mysterious and frightening trucker Rusty Nail ('The Silence Of The Lambs' Ted Levine). Of course the whole scenario is hugely indebted to Spielberg's suspense classic 'Duel', but Dahl and co. manage to put a fresh and exiting spin on familiar material. 'Roadkill' won't change your life, but it is a genuinely exciting and effective thriller, a real rarity in Hollywood these days. Hitchcock it ain't but it's a very entertaining popcorn movie with plenty of thrills and twists. Recommended.

What's the point if all 3 leads survive?! Heck, even the minor character who was kidnapped by Rusty Nail survived without a scratch. In the end it's just a tense After School Special where the kids learn a lesson on playing practical jokes on strangers.The least they could've done was have Leelee's head get blown off when the motel room door opened. It's supposed to be a horror movie! Someone has to die! 6 stars for the suspense.

First, we have to assume that there's a psycho trucker out there who would stop at nothing to avenge a cruel prank.  OK, I guess I can buy that. But...(Possible spoilers follow!!) ... how did he keep finding them, wherever they went? ... how did he learn their names? ... how did he find their CB radio, and hide it in their car without being detected? ... how did he know they were listening from the next room? ... oh boy, this is a big one -- how did he know about Venna's roommate, and how did he find her? ... how did he know which road they'd take when he left a spray-painted message on road signs, and when did he find the time to be leaving personalized graffiti along with all the other torment he was causing? ... and above all, if he was really intent on killing them, why didn't he do it when he easily had the chance (while their car was wedged between his truck and a tree)??I know a lot of people liked this film, but to me, there were too many unbelievable or unexplainable moments to make it into the thriller it could have been.Leelee Sobieski and Steve Zahn were very good.  Even though I didn't like the movie, they deserve credit for doing a fine job.

It is crazy how underrated this movie is. It is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. It is an excellent movie. I highly recommend it. I feel nervous every time I watch the movie.Paul Walker picks up his brother Steve Zahn from jail and they end up pranking a truck driver named Rusty Nail, he finds out, they reveal it was a prank, he doesn't take it too well, and mayhem ensues.The performances are great across the board but my guy Ted Levine's voice role is terrifying. He makes this movie terrifying. The tension is crazy throughout.Check this movie out. I'm a little mixed on the ending, but I will let you all decide for yourselves. Be well.

It is not a bad movie. It has enough excitement to make you sit it out. It's just another copy of same old, same old. The dialogues are pretty poor in my opinion, I can't remember enjoying one line in particular. The idea is old, done routinely. Guys pull a prank on some dude, a trucker in this flick, and the prankee is 'not amused'. The entire film is about the main characters being chased. No great special effects, no great acting, no great music score, no great nothin'. The sideline about the brother in prison is useless in my opinion, it serves no purpose. Television stuff. And yes, there is a possibility Joy Ride II will see the light.

This movie lacks of a crucial element one might call logic. The character development itself is fundamentally flawed, seeing as how there is simply none. The omniscient and omnipotent "psycho guy" is never quite explained. His motives are never clear, other than the "I'll make you guys pay!" The means of which he accomplishes his acts are never explicitly (or implicitly) stated either. Rather, everything must be assumed. This in itself would not be so bad, since the antagonist can stay hazy for the purposes of the plot. However, the protagonist (played by Paul Walker) is not much better in terms of getting a sense of the character. The opening scene depicts a dorm room with books haphazardly spread about. It is later revealed that he is at Berkeley on a full scholarship. This is what I have the most problem believing. Then why the hell is he such a dumbass? In fact, his brother and his friend are much of the same. For the most part of the movie, they run away screaming, nevermind the fact that they outnumber the bad guy three to one. They never think of picking up a weapon. And yes, they even meet the bad guy in a dark corn field in the middle of nowhere alone.For the greater part of the movie, I wanted the bad guy to catch them and torture them, resulting in slow, painful death. Whoever said the characters are real is either very stupid, or very stupid. I don't see how anyone can relate to the characters, unless the people they know have an IQ that rivals most rocks. Put aside the lack of character development and unbelievable plot devices, the director was quite effective at creating tension and conveying the fear of the characters. There were also some funny moments, most brought on by the hilarious Steve Zahn. The movie is really quite fun to watch, and the action (though brainless) delivers the appropriate thrills.

I went to "Joy Ride" with high expectations -- having enjoyed the work of Steve Zahn and John Dahl immensely in the past. But what I got was a poorly done by-the-numbers thriller with several numbers missing. "Joy Ride" is typical of movies these days that present a few good set-piece scenes but don't make them come together into a satisfying whole.The problem here is almost exclusively in the script. The villain is a chillingly evil, faceless trucker who is apparently omniscient. He knows everything about his victims -- who they are, where they are at all times, even where their friends are. But how? This omniscience is never even remotely explained and makes no sense. Without even this semblance of logic, the events in the film have little context and carry little punch. If the kids in the film were dealing with a maniac who, bad as he is, has to play by the same rules of reality as everyone else, and thus can be outsmarted, the film would have some point. As it is, it's just a series of scares that quickly becomes ho-hum.What a disappointing misuse of a great cast and a talented director.  Who green lights things like this?  I guess audiences are still going to see it, but they deserve much more.

Stephen Spielberg's debut film 'Duel', about a man who inadvertently offends a truck driver, is still one his best, leaner than most of his subsequent work and none the worse for it. More than thirty years later comes John Dahl's 'Rodakill', a film occupying very similar territory, but in no way superior to its predecessor. Dahl is actually quite good at handling the action scenes, but his film is a bit cruder, a bit more over-the-top, and a considerably less plausible than Spielberg's masterpiece (the truck, for example, seems to have a tighter turning circle than a running human!) 'Roadkill' is still possessed of a certain gut power; but less, in the case of this comparison, is definitely more.

With a friend's recommendation, I was invited to see this film.  Granted, it looked like another silly horror/stalker flick from the previews way back when, but I kept an open mind as I sat down to watch this latest suspense/thriller.While it wasn't spectacular, I did have some fun with it.I think that came from the fact that the leads were enjoyable, and there were some entertaining and funny moments throughout all of "Rusty Nail's" stalking.  It's the timeless story of two kids driving cross-country, and why it's not a good idea to mess with people too much.  It's also a good lesson in that when one gets busted for something like this, it's not a good idea to tell the recipient of the practical joke what an idiot they are for falling for the gag.What we're left with is an angry truck driver who remarkably has more leads and connections on these kids that the Psychic Friends Network could only dream of having.  Therein lay the problem for me.  "Rusty Nail" knew remarkably too much about these characters, and I kept wondering why is it that he never had to report in to anybody, like his bosses for example. Don't truck drivers have to keep a schedule, and aren't some trucker agencies going to be more than a little unhappy if these schedules aren't met?  I don't know of too many truck drivers who have the luxury of postponing their deliveries to go chase a few practical joking kids all over the country for a few days.  Maybe that's a benefits package I simply haven't heard of.Regardless, some of the scenes were entertaining (the fate of the ice truck early in the film comes to mind), there were funny moments, a decent tense spot or two, and given the circumstances and how far one is willing to just sit back and relax with the movie, some of the situations concocted managed to work.  I'm just very glad they chose not to use some of the DVD's alternate endings.  They had "Rusty Nail" come off as more of the Terminator in terms of endurance.It's a fun movie to sit around with friends and talk about.  Take that as such, and don't try to figure out the plot holes.

This was a very good movie, full of suspense, but I hated the ending.. Maybe if they would show the bad guy's face it might have been better. I hope there is a part 2 so we can find out what happens in the end.. I gave the movie a seven but it could have received a nine if it would have ended with part one.

Who does not think of this movie every time they pass a roadhog on the highway? How could you possibly not think of this? Like the woman from T2 who asks them if they want fries with their burgers. The tail light scene is priceless. Great chases, great suspense, only until the chick shows up does it start to lull and get boring but Rusty Nail is never far behind with his pink champagne. And of course, Ted Levine as the trucker's voice is unique as we all know. Dad used to watch it when he was alive. He loved it. Sad about Paul Walker. But yeah, nothing to really say except its a good movie and you think of it without fail every time you pass or a roadhog passes you.

An intense action/horror/thriller directed by John Dahl that stars Steve Zahn (Stuart Little 2, Sahara), Paul Walker (2 Fast 2 Furious, Into the Blue), and Leelee Sobieski (The Glass House, Eyes Wide Shut).This movie is one of the most intense and most psychologically frightening movies ever made, that includes a shocking surprise ending. I'm surprised Wes Craven didn't direct this film, it would have been twice as scary. But John Dahl did a very good job. It is so freaky and so intensely strong that my heart kept racing. Each action/horror sequence kept eclipsing the last. Each thrill gets more thrilling and more shocking as time goes on. Joy Ride is a film everyone that's over the age of 12 will enjoy. I say 12 because it is extremely intense and there is some nasty violence in this film that might not be suitable for people under the age of 12.Without giving too much away, I can only say never buy a crappy forty dollar C.B. and prank call anyone you don't know. Bad things could happen. And believe me, this guy is very dangerous and does not like to be messed with, little do Lewis (Walker) and Fuller (Zahn) Thomas, and Lewis's girlfriend, Venna (Sobieski) know. Mwahahahahahahahaha!My tip...NEVER EVER PRANK SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW! Joy Ride is a weirdly named title, and yet it isn't. I think it partly isn't because I can't think of a better name for it, so, yet, I think it's a pretty good title.**** out of **** stars.10/10 Original MPAA rating: R: Violence/Terror and LanguageMy MPAA rating: R: Intense Sequences of Violence and Terror, Strong Language, and Male Nudity.My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes, Nudity

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Simple premise, very straightforward story that had lots of Intense suspenseful scenes that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Something that started off as benign joke between two brothers turns in a nightmare quick. I think the two leads did pretty good job & it's a distance amount of character development where you get invested just enough to genuinely care about what happens to them.(Lewis) is the younger brother but yet more mature & level headed as the older brother (fuller) inferior irrational one who seems like he's struggling to get his life together. The common misconception is that with age comes a level of maturity but that's not the case, But I love his enthusiasm through out the whole film & he had some non-intentional funny moments.I think the movies does a great job at not fully revealing the man identity in the truck, pretty much keeping it a mystery which adds to the eeriness .With that being said I do have some negatives to express about the film. Some directions they took wasn't logical like how was this man able to follow them around in the this era where we didn't have technology?? Was trying my hardest to make sense of it & the first conclusion I came up with was that he was able to trace them through the radio but at one point fuller threw the radio out the car 😭 so that left me puzzled. Or after the near death experience the first time why they ain't report it to the cops like this movie could've really been over in 46 minutes but of course they gotta figure out a way to keep the story going .

Half movie is dull, second half is better. This is Paul Walker's movie from his earlier days, he looks teenager ( 18 years ago now in 2019). Two brothers gone on ride and making some kind of joke that pretending voice of a girl to unknown driver on car radio while highway run, but unfortunately joke is turned into a psycho killers' trap. Along with them their girlfriends also being involved in. Climax is interesting but end is not perfect. It seems uncompleted or having another sequel. Acting side is just okay. Steve Zahn is better than Paul Walker. If you are road rash or car/truck chasing lovers the you must see 'Duel' movie (1971) directed by Steven Spielberg. It is best movie on same subject. Must watch it for get real highway thrill and avoid this one.

I loved watching Joyride. That's my kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend watching it, especially at night.

A couple of punk kids use a CB to prank off the wrong guy in this above average teen thriller. I say above average, but as far as teen thrillers go, with "I know what you did last summer", "Urban Legends", and their ilk cluttering up the sub-genre, a movie like this is frigging' Macbeth.Not to say this film is without flaws, Leelee Sobieski is pretty wooden in her role as Venna and there are plot holes that you can even drive Rusty Nail's truck through. However it does create some good tension, so I'm willing to overlook that.My Grade: B- Fox DVD Extras: Commentary by Director John Dahl; 2nd commentary by Writes Clay Tarver and J.J. Abrams; 3rd Commentary by Steve Zahn and Leelee Sobrieski; Making-of; Deleted scenes; 4 alternate endings; Voice auditions for Rusty Nail; White Rabbit type Branching option; Theatrical trailer

This was a dumb movie.  That the plot springs from a CB radio should have been a tip-off.  Do you know anybody who uses a CB radio these days?  You probably won't know anybody as dumb as the guys in this movie, either, because if you ever came across anybody like them, you would have run. They do dumb things, and then dumber things.  You're just saying, "Oh, no," all the way through it.The movie IS suspenseful so if that is what you are after, it won't disappoint there.  Just don't ask too many questions like, "How did she get here, or how would he have known that."  Suspend logic.
