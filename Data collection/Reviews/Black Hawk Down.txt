I've been watching this movie and its accompanying extras on DVD this week for the first time and I thought is ironic that this very American war story should be directed and produced by an Englishman (Ridley Scott) and have a large number of British actors cast as the American servicemen (Ewan McGregor, Jasson Issacs, Hugh Dancy, Euan Bremner, Orlando Bloom.) I suppose it's the equivalent of Steven Spielberg directing a film about the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War and casting Americans as members of the Parachute Regiment.Scott's movie is quite brave in that it has no major stars and no central character (unlike, say Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or Mel Gibson in WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS). It's also largely free of the clichés of the genre: no soaring John Williams score accompanying shots of the flag fluttering in the sunlight; no scenes of the families back home. Instead its all about the logistics and the absolute horror of battle. This is the best combat footage since ZULU way back in 1964, a film which it resembles. In Scott's commentary description words, it is 'Anti-War but pro-military'.

I vividly remembered the news reports in October 1993 of the body of an American serviceman being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu following the battle there . A couple of years later my interest of the battle was rekindled by an edition of the BBC`s excellent history show TIMEWATCH  that spoke to the survivors of " The biggest firefight involving American troops since Vietnam " , so when Mark Bowden released his book BLACK HAWK DOWN I opened the first page and found myself unable to put it down , and when I heard Ridley Scott was going to bring Bowden`s book to the big screen I was looking forward to seeing it I did enjoy the movie and have to take issue with some of the comments raised . First of all people complain about events and incidents being changed , I know how you feel but with any adaptation there`s bound to be bits condensed , the only real criticisms that can justified is that this film version totally negates the Somali point of view ( For those of you who haven`t read the book Mark Bowden writes his account in a similar subjective manner Corneilus Ryan wrote his trilogy - two of which THE LONGEST DAY and A BRIDGE TOO FAR were made into blockbuster movies - dealing with the last months of the war in Europe ) but Bowden`s book is an account of the battle of Mogadishu , that`s what it is - An account that doesn`t really concern itself with wider issues like politics or anti-war sentiment , so it seems churlish to complain about concepts like character development because that`s not what the story is about . I`ve also heard teenage girls complain that Orlando Bloom doesn`t get enough screen time and that they found it too violent . I`m sorry to hear that girls , hopefully next time you go to the cinema you might like to find out what you`re letting yourself in for . As for the rest of the screenplay it is accurate right down to the friction between the Deltas and the Rangers and the fact the Americans were actually rescued by a UN force composed of Malaysians and Pakistanis
Ridley Scott rightly deserved an Oscar nomination with BHD . It`s his movie and he surpasses anything Spielberg achieved with the overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN . War is hell and this is a film of stark and haunting imagery of victims of famine , of mutilated soldiers and civilians . Both editing and cinematography are superb with many great scenes like the small stream of American soldiers walking up the street while on the other side of the houses a massive torrent of armed militiamen are walking in the same direction . My only real complaints of what`s on screen is Ewan McGregor`s awful American accent ( It`s especially so when you stop to consider that most of the cast aren`t played by American actors )and Hans Zimmer score resembles that of most of his other movies , but I shouldn`t nitpick because I found this Scott`s best film alongside GLADIATOR

Unlike most of the war movies of our time, Black Hawk Down sticks to the facts about what happened in Mogadishu and doesn't romanticize the story. To support this observation, the viewer will notice that there is not really one main character. This shows that the film focuses more on what happened in Somalia instead of on the characters personality and/or struggles. Another important aspect of the film that makes it so great is the cinematography. Not only was the setting of the film accurate to the real thing, but the way that the movie was filmed is great because it seems like someone is running along the battle scene getting everything on tape. In addition, the film contains small aspects that one may not notice that are important to the situation in Mogadishu. For instance, the bullet shells that fell from the firing helicopter fell into one of the soldiers' vests, and he scrambled to get it out because of how hot it was. This small detail makes the movie that much more realistic. To conclude, Black Hawk Down is a great movie that is both an eye opener that sticks to the facts as well as a quality film. I recommend this movie to any war-film fan, as well as anyone that likes watching movies in general.

Black Hawk Down is first and foremost an immensely effective war film, but beyond that, its one of the most subtly differently made war films ever. Most war films usually either have a single hero through whom we see everything (i.e. Platoon), or present us with a squad of soldiers, all of whom are identifiable "types" (i.e. Saving Private Ryan). Black Hawk Down takes a different approach, instead giving us a very wide array of characters, none clearly singled out as a hero or type to command the audience's attention. The general effect is to create that feeling of a team army that George C. Scott so ardently expounded to us at the start of Patton. Furthering this feel of military professionalism, the film never cheapens itself by putting too much emotional weight into one moment. The plot moves ahead at a constant pace, cutting from location to location, without slowing down to focus too much on individual soldiers. The effect is of watching documentary footage of a real military operation gone wrong. While the effect of this scripting approach may produce some detachment among viewers on the first viewing, it makes the film all the better on subsequent viewings.And you'd better believe there will be subsequent viewings, because Ridley Scott has created one of cinema's all-time great pieces of eye candy here. The editing, cinematography, grading, scoring and visual effects all combine to leave a viewer just as drained upon leaving the theatre as these soldiers were on leaving Mogadishu. The intensity of this film's combat is easily equal to Saving Private Ryan, and leaves such pretenders as We Were Soldiers behind in the dust. Black Hawk Down lacks the former's emotional resonance, but unlike the latter, it thrives on the fact, creating a final product as mind-challenging in its construction as it is mind-blowing its visualization.

When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.For whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After "stirring up the hornet's nest", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, "Leave No Man Behind".Needless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells "RPG's!" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.While the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn't take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you're not sure which side is more disorganized. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.It's pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can't imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play "Dead Somali with a Gun #354".Although characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn't have the problem of some war movies, where it's sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best lines in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.As expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood. He also uses animals and non-military personnel well in some of the shots to show that this firefight is happening in the middle of a populated market district.A big deal has been made out of the blood and gore in Black Hawk Down, but what is any true war movie without it? Though most of the graphic violence on display is not far beyond Saving Private Ryan, there is at least one visceral sequence that will make most people squeamish, unless they watch those operation shows on The Learning Channel for entertainment. Black Hawk Down is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.In a genre that has brought out some of the best in directors and actors, Black Hawk Down is easily the best war movie ever made, and it has replaced A Beautiful Mind as my candidate for Best Picture and Director.Rating: 10 out of 10

Black Hawk is quite simply the best movie of the year (2001) and the best war movie I have seen.  It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.Ahh emotions, a subject of much debate where this movie is concerned, at least among some critics. While the reviews for Black Hawk Down have on average ranged from "Good to Excellent," there has been persistent and growing criticism over the lack of clearly drawn out characters that the audience could connect with, the lack of historical context,  and the fact that movie is all action, with no heart, with no point-of-view. Well I think those who criticize the movie on these grounds, have completely missed the point of the movie, and are flat-out wrong. It is a movie told from the soldiers point-of-view, pure and simple. This is not a political movie, this is not a movie that needs cheap sentimentality or conventional emotional "hooks" for the characters.  As much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, the overly sentimental framing device used by Spielberg, really annoyed me. It felt like he was pandering to the audience just a little bit, and it wasn't necessary. Well, there's no pandering here, no cheap sentimentality in Black Hawk Down, just the horrible, gruesome, disorienting reality of modern combat. I didn't know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center, but I was moved to tears by what happened to them on Sept. 11 and that's the way I felt today in the movie.As far as I am concerned there was plenty of emotion in Black Hawk Down, plenty of "choke-up" moments, or moments when I was moved by the unbelievable courage shown by the soldiers as they faced an almost hopeless situation. I'm not sure how anyone could not be moved by seeing these 18-25 year-old men trapped in the horror of a Civil War that had no bearing on U.S. National Security. As portrayed by the amazing ensemble cast, these men (really boys in many cases) showed the full range of emotions that our soldiers must have gone through, not to mention the fear and confusion of their situation. To me the cast standouts were Josh Hartnett (boy has he got BIG FUTURE STAR written all over him) as Staff Sgt Eversmann and Australian actor Eric Bana as Sgt 1st Class "Hoot."Black Hawk Down is a great movie, and it is an important movie. It is the story of courage and heroism against nearly insurmountable odds. What happened in Somalia was a foreign policy failure for the U.S., but the actions of the soldiers sent into battle that October day were anything but failure. That there were not more casualties is a credit to them and ultimately a credit to all of us.

This film has a massive ensemble cast, and every actor played their part well. The action sequences are superbly choreographed with realistic fight/bullet wounds, and practical effects such as explosions. The score by Hans Zimmer adds tensity in the action that's taking place. The cinematography and color choices are good for the film's setting and story. However, I had a hard wanting to care for the characters. They are barely developed and indistinguishable. It's hard keeping track of who's who. The story is simplistic and one-sided. A bit insight into the Somali's point of view of the event would have help the movie to be much more intriguing. Overall, a well-made movie with great production value and good performances but that aren't enough to redeem the trite plot.

I've just got this movie on DVD - I did see it on the big screen and it blew my mind.  Being from Australia we had practically no idea of what was going on in Somalia, and after seeing this movie and then reading the book - it is an eye opener.Now that I've watched it a few more times, I've noticed one thing with this movie.  The music.  Aside from the story and the cinematography and the editing which all are so well done that you feel like you are there with them; the music is a big contributor to the feel of the movie, and in my opinion, more so than in a lot of films.It is very subtle, it has taken me 10 viewings to even notice there was music there.  It really helps create the atmosphere, going from lighthearted, almost fun in the beginning with various rock/pop tracks into deep and moving operatic styles as the story progesses into the war and further.It is the top of my list of favourites for many reasons, but I think mostly it is the way the whole package comes together to tell the story of what happened that makes it so good.Well worth viewing many times over.

If you read other reviews of Black Hawk Down, people praise the realism of the conflict in Somalia, along with the accurate portrayals of the American forces against the rebelling usurpers. However, these people seem to 1) have no idea what the conflict in Somalia was actually like, and 2) be completely blinded by the film's huge budget allowing a lot of dramatic set pieces.Without a doubt this is a good war film: a cast ahead of its time (such as relative unknowns Orlando Bloom and Ewan McGregor) dropped into a war zone very different to those often portrayed on the big screen. Beyond this, however, not a lot more is on show - the fight scenes are predictable and simplistic, and a script isn't really required in between the bursts of gunfire. Black Hawk Down also leans fairly heavily on the trope of "down but not out", as every squad seems to be afflicted by someone who is a magnet for shrapnel and bullets, but continues to push through the swathes of war.The production value salvages a lot for this movie, creating an atmosphere of legitimate danger often missing from action films. Furthermore, the use of aerial combat shows a degree of confidence from the producers (often avoided when budgets are slightly more restrictive). Black Hawk Down doesn't quite exceed the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but certaininly is above average on the merits of its hectic battle scenes.

Gripping, exciting and downright dramatic, this war drama from Ridley Scott is another notch in the director's blossoming career (following on from the disappointing HANNIBAL). Scott handles both the drama and action with flair and skill and the result is an epic-feeling movie which, following on from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, shows you what war is really all about. Forget the long-gone days of cinema where soldiers never got dirty and war was glamourised to the extreme; this is a film that puts you right into the thick of the action, making you feel like you're actually taking part in the battle. The realism is thick and at the end of the film you feel exhausted so you know the work has paid off.Technically, the film is excellent, with fine action choreography and some great camera angles that are up close and personal. The various CGI effects are used to heighten the realism of the drama, but the main thing is that you never feel like you're watching CGI, so they are effective in the utmost. The film is bleak, violent and also extremely gory in places, so only strong stomachs need apply. A cast loaded with faces fill out their roles respectively and make you feel for the various characters – in particular William Fichter, Jason Isaacs, Kim Coates, Tom Sizemore and Ewen Bremner give fine performances, as well as the more famous leads. BLACK HAWK DOWN is a classic and exciting war film, utilising state-of-the-art technology to make it even more intense than before. Check this one out.

Black Hawk Down(2001) is truly a great war movie. Filmed extroirdinarally with gritty action scenes, this movie is (one of) the best war movies I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. The movie is based(noticed BASED, which the director admitted they filled in A LOT of gaps they had no info on)on true events of a small force of soldiers going into an african town to take out a leader and his men, whom are blocking all food from a close town. Even food America sends over, we learn, they take as theirs. So one bad thing leads to another, and the ride they came in on, crashes, hence the name Black Hawk Down. While I thought the film was a little of a copy off of SPR, with the camera movements, to the filming style itself, did not hinder this movie's effect on audiences at all. The pain, and whole torturous hours those soldiers were without help was shocking. It leaves you sitting in your seat after it's over, thinking what it must of been like, every second they were in theiir, always fighting. Getting this movie will pay off. I guarantee it-moviecritic2003

I have seen many War movies and I am myself a very die hard Military Technology Enthusiast but I have hardly seen any movie which is as correct as this one. This movie simply gives you the feel of the actual action which went on during this battle. Everything from the way the soldiers moved, took their position, fired from covered positions, gave covering fire to each other, the use of Explosives including grenade and the way they captured strategic places even without much help from Air Force gave a true and absolutely realistic view of Real Time Urban Combat. It shows that Humvees are not impenetrable and the Soldier manning the machine gun post is extremely vulnerable from Roof Top Fire. Again the way Small Arms like the LMG & UMG were used were impressive and the tactics used by Special Forces to fend off attackers and secure the perimeter was true to all my knowledge. I appreciate the Director and actors to carry out this War Movie with such accuracy. If you are a Defence Enthusist this movie is must watch and if not then too one must watch it to understand is WAR is nothing less then HELL. Since this based on true incident let's pay respect to those who sacrificed their lives and salute those who have lived another day to fight.

Black Hawk Down, co-produced and directed by Ridley Scott, is based on a true story taking place in Somalia, Mogadishu in the early '90s. Elite forces were sent there to participate in a UN peacekeeping action and the task was to abduct two of Farrah Aidids, a Somalian warlord, lieutenants. But it proves more difficult than they previously had thought after two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and in turn led to a fiasco, a failure that has devastating consequences. Starring as Eversmann is the well-known actor Josh Hartnett, from Lucky Number Slevin. Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan) plays Danny, a tough and fearless sergeant, and as the comic relief is Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting).The actual script is based from a book by Mark Bowden, a soldier who wrote it while he was in Somalia and it explains partly of why we get to see the U.S. point of view, which to me tend to be somewhat patriotic in these cases. When the bullets whiz past helmets, and the grenades explodes in the battlefield, you feel very much that you are there without getting hit. Elite units stood side by side when hell broke loose, and together achieve their goal - to overthrow the dictator. The idea to leave someone on the battlefield did not exist, it was one for all - all for one.From a realistic way the film works very well, like when guts and body parts fly off from bodies, but I am slightly hesitant about the way Somalis was portrayed. Were they really a faceless evil enemy through and through? I got the impression that Somalia was ruled by criminals, drug addicts, drug dealers and murderers. In one scene the Somalis attacks one of the helicopters and they looked like a horde of ants looking for their prey. If it was a Somali film instead, it would probably look quite different compared to this American bias. Sure, all the historical facts is not always easy to get in a reality-based film and I accept that. Some scenes are very daring and are nicely assembled. The color has a mostly somber gray tone, and the barren, cold realism that the film shows is great executed. The war "only" lasted in hellish 15 hours resulting in 18 dead and 73 injured U.S. soldiers and hundreds of dead Somalis.

I read Bowden's book by the same title. All of those who claim that this movie follows the book closely clearly lack in reading comprehension. The book took a balanced approach to the conflict. We learn about the events leading up to the Battle of Mogadishu. Bowden interviews both Somalis and US soldiers and we learn about their motivations.In the Scott's work all of the characters are flat. They're cookie-cutter "American heroes" who are completely indistinguishable from one another. The Somalis are depicted as crazed hordes who are inexplicably hell-bent on US blood.I could go on, but the opening "background" text says enough. It suggests that US soldiers were merely there on a humanitarian mission to rescue the population from a genocidal warlord. What they don't tell you is that shortly before the events in BHD, the Habr Gedir clan elders had met to discuss the peace proposal put forth by Admiral Howe the previous day. Due to lack of intelligence Cobra helicopters armed with TOW missiles attacked massacred 54 people. With this act they succeeded in making enemies of the entire Somali people. Note that military advisers were with the film crew and able to veto every decision.Read Bowden's book or google the Battle of Mogadishu for more. Propaganda that is thinly dressed as entertainment gets 0 stars from me. The only difference between this and old Soviet propaganda is production value.

I'm not a fan of war movies usually,but when i sat down to watch Black Hawk Down,i couldn't turn it off.Heres a war movie which doesn't sugar coat.There is no crappy dialogue,no soppy love story tie ins,just the real deal,brutal battle scenes,the gruesome reality of war.Black Hawk Down is based on a true story,the bloody battle at Somalia and it leaves one drained.Its confronting,and exposes war in its true light-there's nothing glamorous to see.In two hours and a bit the viewer is able to imagine being there at the horrible battleground,and suffering like the soldiers did.It really makes you appreciate how lucky we are to be in a free country,relatively peaceful,and not having our lives threatened every second of the day.Everything about BHD is right; the setting of the film,the Somalians,the American soldiers going through hell,the brutality,the battle,thefatalities.Not for the faint hearted,or weak stomached,but a truly powerful,compelling motion picture.Ridley Scott takes the viewer on an imaginative journey through Black Hawk Down and appeals to our emotions.A brutal,yet bearable war film.

While the theatrical cut still resulted in a meaningful film, it irked me originally in the theater and then again recently upon seeing it again that very significant moments from the original Philadelphia Inquirer articles were left out. It was as if someone hadn't just forced Ridley Scott to cut the film down for time, but to de-emphasize the disparity in training and personalities between the Tier One units and everyone else. Was it because they wanted the Rangers to do interviews and go on the talk circuit to help publicize the film? Regardless, the Extended Edition adds back footage I had no idea they bothered to even shoot. The only big thing missing is that Delta medic Earl Fillmore isn't a character, but I assume his family wasn't interested in him being portrayed at all, which is unfortunate. In the Extended Edition, Wolcott instead serves the Fillmore role of reassuring someone and then himself becoming an early KIA. In fact, Fillmore was killed while moving to Wolcott's crash site. So, this was a very smart and fitting proxy. The theatrical cut is, frankly, an inexcusable version that no one should be watching when the extended exists.

There's no jingoism. No glorification. Just a telling of what went on. It doesn't dwell in the horrific, it has a tale to tell and does it. An amazing cast.

If you like war action films, this one is for you! After a slow start - about 40 minutes to set things up - it's almost non-stop action the rest of the way as American soldiers fight in the streets of Somalia.Frankly, it was too much action for me, but I'm not a kid anymore so non-stop action gets a bit tiring after 20 minutes. This thing goes almost non-stop for 100 straight minutes. After awhile you want to just say, "Enough already! Let's take a break! I don't know how much of this story is true. When they say, "based on a true story" that could mean as much as 90 percent of it is fictionalized for dramatic purposes. However, reports are that it is pretty accurate. Regardless, the film has some good things going for it.First of all there is the military credo:: "Never leave anyone behind." That message certainly is demonstrated here even at the cost of about 20 American lives and who knows who many Somalis as soldiers go back into action to rescue men after a helicopter (named Black Hawk) goes "down."With today's filmmakers and special effects capabilities, you get Saving Private Ryan-type realistic action scenes. That also means you get some gruesome scenes, too. This film is very bloody. It's intense and visually unique, I think, for a war film. Speaking of that, with director Ridley Scott, you get stylish visuals: lots of them. In this film, you see bunch of interesting orange-ish colors, great lighting and great facial closeups. The sound also is excellent with bullets "flying out" of all the surround speakers.In the end, a little too much but still a good military movie that does justice to the unselfishness and heroism of the men in the military.

This flick are a straight-to-the-bone WAR movie! After 35 minutes with "preparing" for battle, the CODE NAME: Irene sounds all over the Speakers, and the Black Hawk/Humwees/Small birds are loaded with US Spec. Forces AKA. US rangers and Delta Force.The film re-creates the American siege of the Somalian city of Mogadishu in October 1993, when a 45-minute mission turned into a 16-hour ordeal of bloody urban warfareAfter the "35 minutes" pre-mission preparing for battle sequence, ( establishing us with the different characters in the movie) it turns into a 1hour 35 minutes long, epic action sequence, where bullets, RPG's and hand grenades are all flowing thru the air, penetraiting hummers, soldiers, humwees and the rest of the environment, making the sand wirvle in front of the cam at all time. All masterly well done by (one of my favourite) directors all time: Ridley Scott. The camera movement, music (Composed by my NUMBER One favourite composer : Hans Zimmer), acting are all pretty good expressed in the film. War is HELL.. And Ridley Scott proves it. There's no romantic. No "Dear mommy". No " I am glad I could die for my country".. Just simple, realistic portrayed WAR sequences,all showing the courage these young Rangers are experiencing.In the actors list, we are meeting a lot of YOUNG/Veterans of Hollywood's superstar team.. All from Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana and Sam Shepard.The movie is violent.. It contains dozens of blood, gore and death. (Though, it ain't close to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan in brutality )But it reflects it in a SERIOUS anti war perspective. No glorification.It's a well done WAR movies, which draws the audience into the events of Moghadishu, Somalia in 1993 October. This film turns into one of my favorite films, and my TOP WAR movie (Besides Saving Private Ryan and Band of brothers)

Ridley Scott directs this excellent war drama. America Elite soldiers, Delta Force, Army Rangers and the 160th SOAR are sent into Mogadishu to remove the warlord Aidid and his lieutenants hopefully to restore some order in Somalia. A Black Hawk is shot down in the middle of the combat zone, and now it is a rescue and extraction mission full of confused misdirection. The viewer is up close and personal and F/X are superior. This movie is hardly emotion free and is not easy to forget. John Hartnett leads a notable cast that includes: Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepard, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana and Jason Isaacs. I especially got a kick out of Elvis' "Suspicious Minds" as the mission took flight. There is not a lack of action or drama. BLACK HAWK DOWN will reinforce pride in those that put their lives on the line for freedom.

Based on the real events of the disastrous Somalia raid on October 3, 1993 where US Army Rangers attempts to capture Somali warlords. This mission was going well until the first Black Hawk helicopter got hit by a rocket and crashed. The Rangers would end up fighting their way to safety.Ridley Scott has given a ultra realism to the movie. This is truly Shock and Awe movie-making. The action starts relatively early and doesn't let up. The impressive cast really delivers. There isn't any glaring deficiency. The only part missing is the Somali side of the story. This is not that kind of a movie. What you get is a Band of Brothers story.

Ridley Scott directs a muscular retelling of the ill fated mission in the Somalian civil war in 1993. Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid declared war on the remaining UN personnel and US forces were deployed to capture Aidid.As always Scott assembles a multi-national cast and future rising stars to tell his story without resorting to war movie clichés. This is a full on assault with bullets flying as the crew of the downed helicopter stave off the Somali militia as their comrades try to extract them whilst other US soldiers try to reach the safety of the UN safe zone.It very much tells the story from the soldiers view and gives a more realistic impression of conflict. It dwells little on the politics but focuses on action but also mixes this with humour even if it might be of the bleak kind. Eric Bana, Josh Harnett give the best performances and good support provided by Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, William Fichtner and Orlando Bloom.This is a strong film, not for the faint-hearted.

From reading the comments by others who have posted here it seems that people were actually ENTERTAINED by this film?  Correct me if I am wrong but to me that seems rather sick.  This movie was a lesson.  It was meant to tell the story of the brave men who fought and died in the third world hole of a town in Somalia.  Anyone who calls this film racist, or that it makes the somali's look like savages is ignorant of the facts and uneducated as to the situation in Somalia in 1993.  The reason there was only one black ranger, was because Kurth and one other who did not figure into the story as well, were the ONLY black men who were members of Task Force Ranger.  The percentage of blacks who apply to Ranger School is very small, this is not because of any race thing,  many blacks serve in the combat arms, and other more specialized groups such as the 82nd Airborne and 101st Airborne.
Yes this movie was well done, but to sit there and talk about how it was wonderfully done and exciting and other BS like that is sickening.  This is also upsetting that something that happened so recently in history can be so quickly forgotten, or called BORING and that the viewer was checking their watch halfway through... Disgusting and arrogant.You don't have to like this film, but do not insult the memories of those men by speaking as if this movie was made for your entertainment.

It tells the true story of a raid in Mogadishu that lead to the first battle between the Somalian Militia and American Rangers. As the title suggests, a Black Hawk does indeed go down. This is a mighty difficult flick to rate. As a representation of modern warfare, it succeeds substantially and sits in the elite group of visceral war films. But as a complete movie? Questionable. Firstly Ridley Scott is such a consistent director in terms of tackling a genre and producing a film that defines that genre. Black Hawk Down is no different, his eye for technical technique and production is second to none. A war torn Mogadishu, practical explosions and effects, utilisation of real Black Hawks and army equipment. It's authentic, and that is a real important factor for a war film. The narrative subtly explores the cost of war on both sides. The US army losing valuable soldiers and equipment (which financially would set them back quite largely) and the Somalian families who are living in ruins. There will always be one view point that towers over the other, but there is the gritty imagery of war and the aftermath that it leaves behind which proves to be effective. This has a massive ensemble cast, with Josh Hartnett being the lead I guess (he is on the cover, sooooo technically...he is the lead). He doesn't deliver, in fact many of the actors don't. That's not their fault though. Scott purposefully chose to focus on the aspects of war rather than glorified American heroes. Even so, there is such limited characterisation that any loss of life delivers no emotional impact for the audience. It's no spoiler that many succumb to their wounds, and yet we're supposed to feel saddened. I physically cannot feel emotive towards someone who I can't relate to, or even care for. That is what prevents this from being an outstanding war film like many classics before. Jason Isaacs was probably the stand out performance for me. Still a decent war flick, it's powerful imagery just about saves it from being lifeless.

If you are young and don't care, you will probably classify this movie as 'cool'. You may even call this the "best war movie ever made." For others, who do have some critical sense left, you will quickly notice that producer Jerry Bruckheimer, once again, tries to rewrite history. Yes, more flagwaving, explosions, patriotic rhetorics and bullets flying all over the place, but no character development what so ever. Is this how war should be portrayed?I guess showing which psychological and emotional effects war has on soldiers is not an option in this one. Instead the audience is bombarded with more than two hours of action-galore nonsense, which looks more like a computergame. Maybe if I had a joystick I would have liked this movie.So we are led to believe that the US troops were there to carry out a mission in good faith? If you took time to read about the background about what REALLY happened, you will feel disgusted after having watched 'Black Hawk Down'. This movie was partially sponsored by Pentagon. Doesn't that tell you something? As a matter of fact, Pentagon dictated that the name of Ewan McGregor's role (the coffee-drinking John Stebbins) should be changed to 'John Grimes', because he in real life is serving a 30-years sentence for raping a 12-year old. In the movie he is, of course, as heroic as the rest - an all-american hero.Don't be fooled.

I've been watching this movie and its accompanying extras on DVD this week for the first time and I thought is ironic that this very American war story should be directed and produced by an Englishman (Ridley Scott) and have a large number of British actors cast as the American servicemen (Ewan McGregor, Jasson Issacs, Hugh Dancy, Euan Bremner, Orlando Bloom.) I suppose it's the equivalent of Steven Spielberg directing a film about the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War and casting Americans as members of the Parachute Regiment.Scott's movie is quite brave in that it has no major stars and no central character (unlike, say Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or Mel Gibson in WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS). It's also largely free of the clichés of the genre: no soaring John Williams score accompanying shots of the flag fluttering in the sunlight; no scenes of the families back home. Instead its all about the logistics and the absolute horror of battle. This is the best combat footage since ZULU way back in 1964, a film which it resembles. In Scott's commentary description words, it is 'Anti-War but pro-military'.

I vividly remembered the news reports in October 1993 of the body of an American serviceman being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu following the battle there . A couple of years later my interest of the battle was rekindled by an edition of the BBC`s excellent history show TIMEWATCH  that spoke to the survivors of " The biggest firefight involving American troops since Vietnam " , so when Mark Bowden released his book BLACK HAWK DOWN I opened the first page and found myself unable to put it down , and when I heard Ridley Scott was going to bring Bowden`s book to the big screen I was looking forward to seeing it I did enjoy the movie and have to take issue with some of the comments raised . First of all people complain about events and incidents being changed , I know how you feel but with any adaptation there`s bound to be bits condensed , the only real criticisms that can justified is that this film version totally negates the Somali point of view ( For those of you who haven`t read the book Mark Bowden writes his account in a similar subjective manner Corneilus Ryan wrote his trilogy - two of which THE LONGEST DAY and A BRIDGE TOO FAR were made into blockbuster movies - dealing with the last months of the war in Europe ) but Bowden`s book is an account of the battle of Mogadishu , that`s what it is - An account that doesn`t really concern itself with wider issues like politics or anti-war sentiment , so it seems churlish to complain about concepts like character development because that`s not what the story is about . I`ve also heard teenage girls complain that Orlando Bloom doesn`t get enough screen time and that they found it too violent . I`m sorry to hear that girls , hopefully next time you go to the cinema you might like to find out what you`re letting yourself in for . As for the rest of the screenplay it is accurate right down to the friction between the Deltas and the Rangers and the fact the Americans were actually rescued by a UN force composed of Malaysians and Pakistanis
Ridley Scott rightly deserved an Oscar nomination with BHD . It`s his movie and he surpasses anything Spielberg achieved with the overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN . War is hell and this is a film of stark and haunting imagery of victims of famine , of mutilated soldiers and civilians . Both editing and cinematography are superb with many great scenes like the small stream of American soldiers walking up the street while on the other side of the houses a massive torrent of armed militiamen are walking in the same direction . My only real complaints of what`s on screen is Ewan McGregor`s awful American accent ( It`s especially so when you stop to consider that most of the cast aren`t played by American actors )and Hans Zimmer score resembles that of most of his other movies , but I shouldn`t nitpick because I found this Scott`s best film alongside GLADIATOR

Unlike most of the war movies of our time, Black Hawk Down sticks to the facts about what happened in Mogadishu and doesn't romanticize the story. To support this observation, the viewer will notice that there is not really one main character. This shows that the film focuses more on what happened in Somalia instead of on the characters personality and/or struggles. Another important aspect of the film that makes it so great is the cinematography. Not only was the setting of the film accurate to the real thing, but the way that the movie was filmed is great because it seems like someone is running along the battle scene getting everything on tape. In addition, the film contains small aspects that one may not notice that are important to the situation in Mogadishu. For instance, the bullet shells that fell from the firing helicopter fell into one of the soldiers' vests, and he scrambled to get it out because of how hot it was. This small detail makes the movie that much more realistic. To conclude, Black Hawk Down is a great movie that is both an eye opener that sticks to the facts as well as a quality film. I recommend this movie to any war-film fan, as well as anyone that likes watching movies in general.

Black Hawk Down is first and foremost an immensely effective war film, but beyond that, its one of the most subtly differently made war films ever. Most war films usually either have a single hero through whom we see everything (i.e. Platoon), or present us with a squad of soldiers, all of whom are identifiable "types" (i.e. Saving Private Ryan). Black Hawk Down takes a different approach, instead giving us a very wide array of characters, none clearly singled out as a hero or type to command the audience's attention. The general effect is to create that feeling of a team army that George C. Scott so ardently expounded to us at the start of Patton. Furthering this feel of military professionalism, the film never cheapens itself by putting too much emotional weight into one moment. The plot moves ahead at a constant pace, cutting from location to location, without slowing down to focus too much on individual soldiers. The effect is of watching documentary footage of a real military operation gone wrong. While the effect of this scripting approach may produce some detachment among viewers on the first viewing, it makes the film all the better on subsequent viewings.And you'd better believe there will be subsequent viewings, because Ridley Scott has created one of cinema's all-time great pieces of eye candy here. The editing, cinematography, grading, scoring and visual effects all combine to leave a viewer just as drained upon leaving the theatre as these soldiers were on leaving Mogadishu. The intensity of this film's combat is easily equal to Saving Private Ryan, and leaves such pretenders as We Were Soldiers behind in the dust. Black Hawk Down lacks the former's emotional resonance, but unlike the latter, it thrives on the fact, creating a final product as mind-challenging in its construction as it is mind-blowing its visualization.

When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.For whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After "stirring up the hornet's nest", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, "Leave No Man Behind".Needless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells "RPG's!" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.While the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn't take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you're not sure which side is more disorganized. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.It's pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can't imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play "Dead Somali with a Gun #354".Although characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn't have the problem of some war movies, where it's sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best lines in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.As expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood. He also uses animals and non-military personnel well in some of the shots to show that this firefight is happening in the middle of a populated market district.A big deal has been made out of the blood and gore in Black Hawk Down, but what is any true war movie without it? Though most of the graphic violence on display is not far beyond Saving Private Ryan, there is at least one visceral sequence that will make most people squeamish, unless they watch those operation shows on The Learning Channel for entertainment. Black Hawk Down is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.In a genre that has brought out some of the best in directors and actors, Black Hawk Down is easily the best war movie ever made, and it has replaced A Beautiful Mind as my candidate for Best Picture and Director.Rating: 10 out of 10

Black Hawk is quite simply the best movie of the year (2001) and the best war movie I have seen.  It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.Ahh emotions, a subject of much debate where this movie is concerned, at least among some critics. While the reviews for Black Hawk Down have on average ranged from "Good to Excellent," there has been persistent and growing criticism over the lack of clearly drawn out characters that the audience could connect with, the lack of historical context,  and the fact that movie is all action, with no heart, with no point-of-view. Well I think those who criticize the movie on these grounds, have completely missed the point of the movie, and are flat-out wrong. It is a movie told from the soldiers point-of-view, pure and simple. This is not a political movie, this is not a movie that needs cheap sentimentality or conventional emotional "hooks" for the characters.  As much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, the overly sentimental framing device used by Spielberg, really annoyed me. It felt like he was pandering to the audience just a little bit, and it wasn't necessary. Well, there's no pandering here, no cheap sentimentality in Black Hawk Down, just the horrible, gruesome, disorienting reality of modern combat. I didn't know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center, but I was moved to tears by what happened to them on Sept. 11 and that's the way I felt today in the movie.As far as I am concerned there was plenty of emotion in Black Hawk Down, plenty of "choke-up" moments, or moments when I was moved by the unbelievable courage shown by the soldiers as they faced an almost hopeless situation. I'm not sure how anyone could not be moved by seeing these 18-25 year-old men trapped in the horror of a Civil War that had no bearing on U.S. National Security. As portrayed by the amazing ensemble cast, these men (really boys in many cases) showed the full range of emotions that our soldiers must have gone through, not to mention the fear and confusion of their situation. To me the cast standouts were Josh Hartnett (boy has he got BIG FUTURE STAR written all over him) as Staff Sgt Eversmann and Australian actor Eric Bana as Sgt 1st Class "Hoot."Black Hawk Down is a great movie, and it is an important movie. It is the story of courage and heroism against nearly insurmountable odds. What happened in Somalia was a foreign policy failure for the U.S., but the actions of the soldiers sent into battle that October day were anything but failure. That there were not more casualties is a credit to them and ultimately a credit to all of us.

This film has a massive ensemble cast, and every actor played their part well. The action sequences are superbly choreographed with realistic fight/bullet wounds, and practical effects such as explosions. The score by Hans Zimmer adds tensity in the action that's taking place. The cinematography and color choices are good for the film's setting and story. However, I had a hard wanting to care for the characters. They are barely developed and indistinguishable. It's hard keeping track of who's who. The story is simplistic and one-sided. A bit insight into the Somali's point of view of the event would have help the movie to be much more intriguing. Overall, a well-made movie with great production value and good performances but that aren't enough to redeem the trite plot.

I've just got this movie on DVD - I did see it on the big screen and it blew my mind.  Being from Australia we had practically no idea of what was going on in Somalia, and after seeing this movie and then reading the book - it is an eye opener.Now that I've watched it a few more times, I've noticed one thing with this movie.  The music.  Aside from the story and the cinematography and the editing which all are so well done that you feel like you are there with them; the music is a big contributor to the feel of the movie, and in my opinion, more so than in a lot of films.It is very subtle, it has taken me 10 viewings to even notice there was music there.  It really helps create the atmosphere, going from lighthearted, almost fun in the beginning with various rock/pop tracks into deep and moving operatic styles as the story progesses into the war and further.It is the top of my list of favourites for many reasons, but I think mostly it is the way the whole package comes together to tell the story of what happened that makes it so good.Well worth viewing many times over.

If you read other reviews of Black Hawk Down, people praise the realism of the conflict in Somalia, along with the accurate portrayals of the American forces against the rebelling usurpers. However, these people seem to 1) have no idea what the conflict in Somalia was actually like, and 2) be completely blinded by the film's huge budget allowing a lot of dramatic set pieces.Without a doubt this is a good war film: a cast ahead of its time (such as relative unknowns Orlando Bloom and Ewan McGregor) dropped into a war zone very different to those often portrayed on the big screen. Beyond this, however, not a lot more is on show - the fight scenes are predictable and simplistic, and a script isn't really required in between the bursts of gunfire. Black Hawk Down also leans fairly heavily on the trope of "down but not out", as every squad seems to be afflicted by someone who is a magnet for shrapnel and bullets, but continues to push through the swathes of war.The production value salvages a lot for this movie, creating an atmosphere of legitimate danger often missing from action films. Furthermore, the use of aerial combat shows a degree of confidence from the producers (often avoided when budgets are slightly more restrictive). Black Hawk Down doesn't quite exceed the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but certaininly is above average on the merits of its hectic battle scenes.

Gripping, exciting and downright dramatic, this war drama from Ridley Scott is another notch in the director's blossoming career (following on from the disappointing HANNIBAL). Scott handles both the drama and action with flair and skill and the result is an epic-feeling movie which, following on from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, shows you what war is really all about. Forget the long-gone days of cinema where soldiers never got dirty and war was glamourised to the extreme; this is a film that puts you right into the thick of the action, making you feel like you're actually taking part in the battle. The realism is thick and at the end of the film you feel exhausted so you know the work has paid off.Technically, the film is excellent, with fine action choreography and some great camera angles that are up close and personal. The various CGI effects are used to heighten the realism of the drama, but the main thing is that you never feel like you're watching CGI, so they are effective in the utmost. The film is bleak, violent and also extremely gory in places, so only strong stomachs need apply. A cast loaded with faces fill out their roles respectively and make you feel for the various characters – in particular William Fichter, Jason Isaacs, Kim Coates, Tom Sizemore and Ewen Bremner give fine performances, as well as the more famous leads. BLACK HAWK DOWN is a classic and exciting war film, utilising state-of-the-art technology to make it even more intense than before. Check this one out.

Black Hawk Down(2001) is truly a great war movie. Filmed extroirdinarally with gritty action scenes, this movie is (one of) the best war movies I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. The movie is based(noticed BASED, which the director admitted they filled in A LOT of gaps they had no info on)on true events of a small force of soldiers going into an african town to take out a leader and his men, whom are blocking all food from a close town. Even food America sends over, we learn, they take as theirs. So one bad thing leads to another, and the ride they came in on, crashes, hence the name Black Hawk Down. While I thought the film was a little of a copy off of SPR, with the camera movements, to the filming style itself, did not hinder this movie's effect on audiences at all. The pain, and whole torturous hours those soldiers were without help was shocking. It leaves you sitting in your seat after it's over, thinking what it must of been like, every second they were in theiir, always fighting. Getting this movie will pay off. I guarantee it-moviecritic2003

I have seen many War movies and I am myself a very die hard Military Technology Enthusiast but I have hardly seen any movie which is as correct as this one. This movie simply gives you the feel of the actual action which went on during this battle. Everything from the way the soldiers moved, took their position, fired from covered positions, gave covering fire to each other, the use of Explosives including grenade and the way they captured strategic places even without much help from Air Force gave a true and absolutely realistic view of Real Time Urban Combat. It shows that Humvees are not impenetrable and the Soldier manning the machine gun post is extremely vulnerable from Roof Top Fire. Again the way Small Arms like the LMG & UMG were used were impressive and the tactics used by Special Forces to fend off attackers and secure the perimeter was true to all my knowledge. I appreciate the Director and actors to carry out this War Movie with such accuracy. If you are a Defence Enthusist this movie is must watch and if not then too one must watch it to understand is WAR is nothing less then HELL. Since this based on true incident let's pay respect to those who sacrificed their lives and salute those who have lived another day to fight.

Black Hawk Down, co-produced and directed by Ridley Scott, is based on a true story taking place in Somalia, Mogadishu in the early '90s. Elite forces were sent there to participate in a UN peacekeeping action and the task was to abduct two of Farrah Aidids, a Somalian warlord, lieutenants. But it proves more difficult than they previously had thought after two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and in turn led to a fiasco, a failure that has devastating consequences. Starring as Eversmann is the well-known actor Josh Hartnett, from Lucky Number Slevin. Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan) plays Danny, a tough and fearless sergeant, and as the comic relief is Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting).The actual script is based from a book by Mark Bowden, a soldier who wrote it while he was in Somalia and it explains partly of why we get to see the U.S. point of view, which to me tend to be somewhat patriotic in these cases. When the bullets whiz past helmets, and the grenades explodes in the battlefield, you feel very much that you are there without getting hit. Elite units stood side by side when hell broke loose, and together achieve their goal - to overthrow the dictator. The idea to leave someone on the battlefield did not exist, it was one for all - all for one.From a realistic way the film works very well, like when guts and body parts fly off from bodies, but I am slightly hesitant about the way Somalis was portrayed. Were they really a faceless evil enemy through and through? I got the impression that Somalia was ruled by criminals, drug addicts, drug dealers and murderers. In one scene the Somalis attacks one of the helicopters and they looked like a horde of ants looking for their prey. If it was a Somali film instead, it would probably look quite different compared to this American bias. Sure, all the historical facts is not always easy to get in a reality-based film and I accept that. Some scenes are very daring and are nicely assembled. The color has a mostly somber gray tone, and the barren, cold realism that the film shows is great executed. The war "only" lasted in hellish 15 hours resulting in 18 dead and 73 injured U.S. soldiers and hundreds of dead Somalis.

I read Bowden's book by the same title. All of those who claim that this movie follows the book closely clearly lack in reading comprehension. The book took a balanced approach to the conflict. We learn about the events leading up to the Battle of Mogadishu. Bowden interviews both Somalis and US soldiers and we learn about their motivations.In the Scott's work all of the characters are flat. They're cookie-cutter "American heroes" who are completely indistinguishable from one another. The Somalis are depicted as crazed hordes who are inexplicably hell-bent on US blood.I could go on, but the opening "background" text says enough. It suggests that US soldiers were merely there on a humanitarian mission to rescue the population from a genocidal warlord. What they don't tell you is that shortly before the events in BHD, the Habr Gedir clan elders had met to discuss the peace proposal put forth by Admiral Howe the previous day. Due to lack of intelligence Cobra helicopters armed with TOW missiles attacked massacred 54 people. With this act they succeeded in making enemies of the entire Somali people. Note that military advisers were with the film crew and able to veto every decision.Read Bowden's book or google the Battle of Mogadishu for more. Propaganda that is thinly dressed as entertainment gets 0 stars from me. The only difference between this and old Soviet propaganda is production value.

I'm not a fan of war movies usually,but when i sat down to watch Black Hawk Down,i couldn't turn it off.Heres a war movie which doesn't sugar coat.There is no crappy dialogue,no soppy love story tie ins,just the real deal,brutal battle scenes,the gruesome reality of war.Black Hawk Down is based on a true story,the bloody battle at Somalia and it leaves one drained.Its confronting,and exposes war in its true light-there's nothing glamorous to see.In two hours and a bit the viewer is able to imagine being there at the horrible battleground,and suffering like the soldiers did.It really makes you appreciate how lucky we are to be in a free country,relatively peaceful,and not having our lives threatened every second of the day.Everything about BHD is right; the setting of the film,the Somalians,the American soldiers going through hell,the brutality,the battle,thefatalities.Not for the faint hearted,or weak stomached,but a truly powerful,compelling motion picture.Ridley Scott takes the viewer on an imaginative journey through Black Hawk Down and appeals to our emotions.A brutal,yet bearable war film.

While the theatrical cut still resulted in a meaningful film, it irked me originally in the theater and then again recently upon seeing it again that very significant moments from the original Philadelphia Inquirer articles were left out. It was as if someone hadn't just forced Ridley Scott to cut the film down for time, but to de-emphasize the disparity in training and personalities between the Tier One units and everyone else. Was it because they wanted the Rangers to do interviews and go on the talk circuit to help publicize the film? Regardless, the Extended Edition adds back footage I had no idea they bothered to even shoot. The only big thing missing is that Delta medic Earl Fillmore isn't a character, but I assume his family wasn't interested in him being portrayed at all, which is unfortunate. In the Extended Edition, Wolcott instead serves the Fillmore role of reassuring someone and then himself becoming an early KIA. In fact, Fillmore was killed while moving to Wolcott's crash site. So, this was a very smart and fitting proxy. The theatrical cut is, frankly, an inexcusable version that no one should be watching when the extended exists.

There's no jingoism. No glorification. Just a telling of what went on. It doesn't dwell in the horrific, it has a tale to tell and does it. An amazing cast.

If you like war action films, this one is for you! After a slow start - about 40 minutes to set things up - it's almost non-stop action the rest of the way as American soldiers fight in the streets of Somalia.Frankly, it was too much action for me, but I'm not a kid anymore so non-stop action gets a bit tiring after 20 minutes. This thing goes almost non-stop for 100 straight minutes. After awhile you want to just say, "Enough already! Let's take a break! I don't know how much of this story is true. When they say, "based on a true story" that could mean as much as 90 percent of it is fictionalized for dramatic purposes. However, reports are that it is pretty accurate. Regardless, the film has some good things going for it.First of all there is the military credo:: "Never leave anyone behind." That message certainly is demonstrated here even at the cost of about 20 American lives and who knows who many Somalis as soldiers go back into action to rescue men after a helicopter (named Black Hawk) goes "down."With today's filmmakers and special effects capabilities, you get Saving Private Ryan-type realistic action scenes. That also means you get some gruesome scenes, too. This film is very bloody. It's intense and visually unique, I think, for a war film. Speaking of that, with director Ridley Scott, you get stylish visuals: lots of them. In this film, you see bunch of interesting orange-ish colors, great lighting and great facial closeups. The sound also is excellent with bullets "flying out" of all the surround speakers.In the end, a little too much but still a good military movie that does justice to the unselfishness and heroism of the men in the military.

This flick are a straight-to-the-bone WAR movie! After 35 minutes with "preparing" for battle, the CODE NAME: Irene sounds all over the Speakers, and the Black Hawk/Humwees/Small birds are loaded with US Spec. Forces AKA. US rangers and Delta Force.The film re-creates the American siege of the Somalian city of Mogadishu in October 1993, when a 45-minute mission turned into a 16-hour ordeal of bloody urban warfareAfter the "35 minutes" pre-mission preparing for battle sequence, ( establishing us with the different characters in the movie) it turns into a 1hour 35 minutes long, epic action sequence, where bullets, RPG's and hand grenades are all flowing thru the air, penetraiting hummers, soldiers, humwees and the rest of the environment, making the sand wirvle in front of the cam at all time. All masterly well done by (one of my favourite) directors all time: Ridley Scott. The camera movement, music (Composed by my NUMBER One favourite composer : Hans Zimmer), acting are all pretty good expressed in the film. War is HELL.. And Ridley Scott proves it. There's no romantic. No "Dear mommy". No " I am glad I could die for my country".. Just simple, realistic portrayed WAR sequences,all showing the courage these young Rangers are experiencing.In the actors list, we are meeting a lot of YOUNG/Veterans of Hollywood's superstar team.. All from Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana and Sam Shepard.The movie is violent.. It contains dozens of blood, gore and death. (Though, it ain't close to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan in brutality )But it reflects it in a SERIOUS anti war perspective. No glorification.It's a well done WAR movies, which draws the audience into the events of Moghadishu, Somalia in 1993 October. This film turns into one of my favorite films, and my TOP WAR movie (Besides Saving Private Ryan and Band of brothers)

It tells the true story of a raid in Mogadishu that lead to the first battle between the Somalian Militia and American Rangers. As the title suggests, a Black Hawk does indeed go down. This is a mighty difficult flick to rate. As a representation of modern warfare, it succeeds substantially and sits in the elite group of visceral war films. But as a complete movie? Questionable. Firstly Ridley Scott is such a consistent director in terms of tackling a genre and producing a film that defines that genre. Black Hawk Down is no different, his eye for technical technique and production is second to none. A war torn Mogadishu, practical explosions and effects, utilisation of real Black Hawks and army equipment. It's authentic, and that is a real important factor for a war film. The narrative subtly explores the cost of war on both sides. The US army losing valuable soldiers and equipment (which financially would set them back quite largely) and the Somalian families who are living in ruins. There will always be one view point that towers over the other, but there is the gritty imagery of war and the aftermath that it leaves behind which proves to be effective. This has a massive ensemble cast, with Josh Hartnett being the lead I guess (he is on the cover, sooooo technically...he is the lead). He doesn't deliver, in fact many of the actors don't. That's not their fault though. Scott purposefully chose to focus on the aspects of war rather than glorified American heroes. Even so, there is such limited characterisation that any loss of life delivers no emotional impact for the audience. It's no spoiler that many succumb to their wounds, and yet we're supposed to feel saddened. I physically cannot feel emotive towards someone who I can't relate to, or even care for. That is what prevents this from being an outstanding war film like many classics before. Jason Isaacs was probably the stand out performance for me. Still a decent war flick, it's powerful imagery just about saves it from being lifeless.

Based on the real events of the disastrous Somalia raid on October 3, 1993 where US Army Rangers attempts to capture Somali warlords. This mission was going well until the first Black Hawk helicopter got hit by a rocket and crashed. The Rangers would end up fighting their way to safety.Ridley Scott has given a ultra realism to the movie. This is truly Shock and Awe movie-making. The action starts relatively early and doesn't let up. The impressive cast really delivers. There isn't any glaring deficiency. The only part missing is the Somali side of the story. This is not that kind of a movie. What you get is a Band of Brothers story.

Ridley Scott directs this excellent war drama. America Elite soldiers, Delta Force, Army Rangers and the 160th SOAR are sent into Mogadishu to remove the warlord Aidid and his lieutenants hopefully to restore some order in Somalia. A Black Hawk is shot down in the middle of the combat zone, and now it is a rescue and extraction mission full of confused misdirection. The viewer is up close and personal and F/X are superior. This movie is hardly emotion free and is not easy to forget. John Hartnett leads a notable cast that includes: Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepard, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana and Jason Isaacs. I especially got a kick out of Elvis' "Suspicious Minds" as the mission took flight. There is not a lack of action or drama. BLACK HAWK DOWN will reinforce pride in those that put their lives on the line for freedom.

From reading the comments by others who have posted here it seems that people were actually ENTERTAINED by this film?  Correct me if I am wrong but to me that seems rather sick.  This movie was a lesson.  It was meant to tell the story of the brave men who fought and died in the third world hole of a town in Somalia.  Anyone who calls this film racist, or that it makes the somali's look like savages is ignorant of the facts and uneducated as to the situation in Somalia in 1993.  The reason there was only one black ranger, was because Kurth and one other who did not figure into the story as well, were the ONLY black men who were members of Task Force Ranger.  The percentage of blacks who apply to Ranger School is very small, this is not because of any race thing,  many blacks serve in the combat arms, and other more specialized groups such as the 82nd Airborne and 101st Airborne.
Yes this movie was well done, but to sit there and talk about how it was wonderfully done and exciting and other BS like that is sickening.  This is also upsetting that something that happened so recently in history can be so quickly forgotten, or called BORING and that the viewer was checking their watch halfway through... Disgusting and arrogant.You don't have to like this film, but do not insult the memories of those men by speaking as if this movie was made for your entertainment.

Ridley Scott directs a muscular retelling of the ill fated mission in the Somalian civil war in 1993. Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid declared war on the remaining UN personnel and US forces were deployed to capture Aidid.As always Scott assembles a multi-national cast and future rising stars to tell his story without resorting to war movie clichés. This is a full on assault with bullets flying as the crew of the downed helicopter stave off the Somali militia as their comrades try to extract them whilst other US soldiers try to reach the safety of the UN safe zone.It very much tells the story from the soldiers view and gives a more realistic impression of conflict. It dwells little on the politics but focuses on action but also mixes this with humour even if it might be of the bleak kind. Eric Bana, Josh Harnett give the best performances and good support provided by Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, William Fichtner and Orlando Bloom.This is a strong film, not for the faint-hearted.

If you are young and don't care, you will probably classify this movie as 'cool'. You may even call this the "best war movie ever made." For others, who do have some critical sense left, you will quickly notice that producer Jerry Bruckheimer, once again, tries to rewrite history. Yes, more flagwaving, explosions, patriotic rhetorics and bullets flying all over the place, but no character development what so ever. Is this how war should be portrayed?I guess showing which psychological and emotional effects war has on soldiers is not an option in this one. Instead the audience is bombarded with more than two hours of action-galore nonsense, which looks more like a computergame. Maybe if I had a joystick I would have liked this movie.So we are led to believe that the US troops were there to carry out a mission in good faith? If you took time to read about the background about what REALLY happened, you will feel disgusted after having watched 'Black Hawk Down'. This movie was partially sponsored by Pentagon. Doesn't that tell you something? As a matter of fact, Pentagon dictated that the name of Ewan McGregor's role (the coffee-drinking John Stebbins) should be changed to 'John Grimes', because he in real life is serving a 30-years sentence for raping a 12-year old. In the movie he is, of course, as heroic as the rest - an all-american hero.Don't be fooled.
