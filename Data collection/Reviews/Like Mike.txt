An unusually strong supporting cast (including Crispin Glover, Robert Forster, Eugene Levy and Anne Meara) enlivens this simple family comedy built around the appealing young actor Lil' Bow Wow. He plays an orphan who, upon finding a magical pair of sneakers, becomes an NBA superstar and in the process befriends another player (Morris Chestnut) with his own family problems. Bow Wow will have an appeal to children of various ages because his own age seems indeterminate; he can act like a teenager (managing various relationships in the orphanage, rallying his teammates) or a pre-teen (gorging himself on so much food he gets sick, saying his prayers at bedtime); and his winning smile makes him non-threatening to adults. There's absolutely nothing that isn't predictable here and the film itself culls themes and sequences from other family films such as `Home Alone' and `E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial'. There's also nothing objectionable either: it's barely above the level of a Disney Channel movie so kids will gobble it up, which isn't a bad thing. The NBA had a hand in making the film in an obvious attempt to improve its bad boy image, and naturally most of the real players come off as kindly, caring and ready to perform good works. (Fortunately, there are exceptions: Allen Iverson doesn't play cute and Gary Payton treats Bow Wow as an equal on the court, making him pay.) Not bad for its genre--that supporting cast definitely helps, especially the always-welcome Glover and Levy--but hardly memorable.

This is a formulaic kinds movie in all senses where you can see every script movie coming a mile away but still manages to be harmless fun. Little Bow Wow plays an orphan who is given a pair of basketball shoes that he believes belonged to Michael Jordan and in turn give him unbelievable skills that he ends up getting signed by the LA Knights NBA team. There are the Normal lesson s of morality and family values you would expect from this kind of movie which thankfully the child actors do not lay on to thick. Moris Chestnut does well in the father figure role and there is able support from Crispin Glover (I bet he regrets asking for so much money that he got written out of 'Back to the Future 2) and Robert Forster (thank god QT saved him), which all results in the inevitable bit not disappointing ending. Would I watch it again? Only with kids present.

Like Mike is a quite formulaic and cheesy family movie about an outsider who is having dreams of becoming somebody famous and of course his dreams come true. Our hero, Calvin Cambridge, (played by Lil Bow Wow) lives in an orphanage in Los-Angeles, near basketball stadium where his favorite NBA team  L.A. Knights plays (by the way fictitious team, real teams in L.A. are Lakers and Clippers). He also loves to play basketball very much and l this game is the only sweet thing that he got in his miserable life in an orphanage. But he is just an ordinary thirteen or fourteen year boy without any special talent for playing his favorite game. One day his finds old sneakers, which are supposed to belong before to some famous basketball player and he believes that was legendary Michael Jordan. After a short confrontation with his rival those sneakers get stuck on a power line and when Calvin is trying to get them back the lightning hits near him and he is shocked by power line. Soon he realizes that his shoes are magic and they give him extraordinary abilities for playing basketball and he wins an exhibition match against real NBA star. There is nothing surprising that after such win he become a player of his favorite team Knights and his life is going to change. The magic promised in the beginning of the story is gone within few minutes and we just see how young celebrity is trying to get into contact with his new partners and fragments of NBA matches with our hero who easily become one of the best players in the whole league and jumps like a  well I don't know exactly like what but one is obvious that he beat some records with his jumps. So Calvin became a NBA player and a celebrity but somehow he has no contract and he still has no any money. Sense of reality is obviously completely lost here. Numerous and mostly silly appearances of actual NBA stars throughout the movie (though some basketball fans obviously would like that), with mentioned scenes of basketball matches and inside the team scenes make that some parts of the movie look like a some kind of silly NBA promotion. And all those basketball elements of the story most of the time easily overshadow all possible morale messages in Like Mike. Well, I believe I have paid enough attention to the movie plot and negative elements and flaws. Despite all above mentioned besides its primitiveness Like Mike is a harmless movie (today that already means something) and not so rude, compared to some recent family friendly movies. The acting is mainly mediocre (the bad guy was really pathetic) with Morris Chestnut (as Tracey Reynolds) as the only bright spot. The chemistry between his character and Lil Bow Wow (who also in some moments shows some acting abilities) is one of a few really decent moments about Like Mike. In the conclusion if you are looking for a good family movie I would rather recommend to find something else than Like Mike, though some kids might like it, particularly die-hard basketball fans.My grade 5 out of 10.

Lil Bow Wow does a good acting job, but Crispin Glover steals the show. Crispin Glover plays himself to perfection.  He doesn't talk very much, only when it serves his own purposes.  Morris Chestnut is also very good as he is one of my favorite actors.  Jonathan Lipnicki's character is annoying and should be kidnapped instead of adopted.  I'm glad they didn't have Bow Wow dunking too much, because it does look fake.  A good family film.  4/10 Fair

Like Mike is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot in particular is awful.OK, let me explain the plot of this awful movie. An orphan, played by Lil Bow Wow, finds a pair of shoes that used to belong to Michael Jordan. The shoes git hit by lightning and whenever this kid wears them he has the abilities of Michael Jordan. Yeagh.............. So then the plot is pretty predictable, he plays great, makes an NBA Team, and helps a bad team to a better record.The plot is just so illogical. Most sports movies are about underdogs that work hard to get better. The whole Idea of a kid finding shoes that make him better and that is the ONLY reason for him to play good just bugs me. Another thing I have an issue with is how good the shoes make this kid. If it gave him the abilities of Michael Jordan, he would not be this good. Do not get me wrong, Jordan is great, but Jordan was not as good as this kid is by wearing the magic shoes. I mean, what type of message is this film supposed to send. Find magic shoes and it will help you to succeed in the NBA. Stupid.Also I really do not like Lil Bow Wow all that much. I mean just look at his name. It sounds like a dogs name.The ending is predictable and terrible. After his shoes break in the last game of the year, he quits after the game even though the team made the playoffs? So basically he is admitting he is nothing without the shoes, which is what he is. I just hate the plot SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much. Stupid magic shoes. And he never really tells any of the players why he can not play in the playoffs. They do not even care. Horrible.Do not watch this film. Ever.

I've started watching this picture with high hopes, you might ask yourself why? well, as a basketball fan at a hole and a NBA fan particularly I'll tell you that there are'nt as many BBall movies as one can expect, But when such a movie does come out in theaters, it is great like "SpaceJam" and a few more.When I saw this movie I thought it's gonna be another great Basketball film that I could watch again and again, but it's nothing but another kids film: Bow Wow acting was insulting and the NBA players were not used properly. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!

I am not saying this movie is perfect as it isn't. The story is very predictable, the ending is a little too silly for my liking and the villain is disappointing, more to do with how he was written than how he was acted. That said, the cinematography, scenery and music are cool and the film is snappily written and directed. The pacing is also brisk, and the chemistry between the two leads is believable. I was impressed with Bow Wow in his debut, he makes for quite an appealing lead and makes the most of what he has. So all in all, this is far from perfect family entertainment but for some harmless fun I actually recommend it. However, for a sophisticated plot or a milestone of a villain, this may disappoint. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Like Mike is clearly one of the best films that I've seen this summer. The film is funny and heartwarming and has the potential to be a sleeper hit. Lil Bow Wow plays Calvin Cmabridge very good in his first lead role he carries the movie very easily by hisself and has good chemsitrsty with Johnaten Lipnicki and Morris Chestnut. The film has good one-liners and great basketball sequences along with cameo's from many NBA like Tracy McGrady,Allen Iverson(who I can't stand) and Jason Kidd and it's also great to see Crispin Glover play a villian. While the film isn't Oscar Worthy it's a great crowd pleaser.

This movie is hilarious, I think it deserves higher than a 5.3! It's heartwarming, story is solid, endearing, has great dialogue, music is awesome, and highly entertaining. I don't think I have any complaints, I appreciate it all. Shad Moss, Jesse Plemmons, Jonathan Lipnicki, and Chrispin Glover are great in my opinion! I love Like Mike even if others don't.

This is by no means, an awful film. I recently downloaded a copy of the film for my sister and she thoroughly enjoyed. She actually enjoyed it so much, she watched in 3 times in the next week! She told me it was a great film and I began to watch it. I must admit, at first the film seemed a little weird but very soon the film introduces you to Kalvin, Reg and Murph and the bully leader Ox. That was one particular strength for the film. Also, when the coach gives Kalvin the tickets, you can start to connect with the character and understand what his life as an orphan must be like. The film got my attention and I began to enjoy it. It had, to be fair, not many laughs but the story was good, closely resembling the story 'Holes' in many ways. Tracy Renalds was a brilliant addition to the film and he really connected well with Kalvin. This was, in my opinion, the biggest strength of this film. Brenda Song does a great job as playing Reg. I'm a big fan of 'Suite Life of Zack and Cody' where she does an amazing job and I thought her performance was great in this film. Bow Wow did a very good job in the film. Overall, definitely ignore IMDb on this circumstance and watch this film. However, note that this film is not for all ages and its mainly for little children but I myself being a 16 year old liked it.

This movie is good if you feel like watching a horrible movie to laugh at with friends. Only watch this with friends. If you watch it alone, it's like drinking alone (or will make you want to drink). This movie has nothing special about it. If you're considering this movie to watch or buy, just go get Rookie of the Year instead. Same movie, better everything.

Like Mike is a great Father and Son Movie everyone could enjoy and relate to.The Movie tells a story about Calvin Cambridge(Lil Bow Wow)Who is a orphan and is looking for the perfect family.One day He stumble upon some shoes which was once worn by a really famous Basketball inside the shoes it features the initials MJ he then realize that famous Basketball player shoes belong to Michael Jordan.One day Calvin wears the shoes and goes to a Los Angeles Knights Game.While at the game he wins a chance to go one on one with Tracey Reynolds(Morris Chestnut)of the Los Angeles Knights.He wins the one on one match up with Tracey thanks to his MJ'S now Calvin Cambridge gets to play in The NBA With the LA Knights.I like this movie a lot because I saw the relationship betweeen Tracey and Bow wow build up in this film And at the end I almost cry because The Moment felt so emotional and well there isn't another word to describe it(And I'm not telling you the ending of the Movie).GO SEE LIKE MIKE A great Family film everyone will love they'll laugh and they'll cry in certain parts of the movie.I give the movie 8 out of 10 Stars

1st watched 4/19/2005 - 4 out of 10(Dir-John Schultz): Sappy formulaic story about an orphan who gets everything he wants and as well gets to be like Mike(Aka. Mister Michael Jordon) when he puts on his magic shoes(that may have been owned by a young MJ) and goes on the basketball court. What I didn't like about this movie was how the bad guys were "really" bad, the good guys were "really" good and everybody smiles up to the end about the poor unfortunate orphan who makes it. I'm not saying that this is a horrible movie but it just follows too many of the same patterns as others like it. The young rapper, Lil Bow Wow, does an OK job with this acting stint but the rest of the cast is kind of just there and playing characters that their used to playing. I really wanted to like this movie as much as I like the game of basketball but it just didn't quite cut it for me.

Like Mike will most likely be a charmer for kids between the ages of five and ten, to which this movie is naturally targeted towards. As someone speaking well outside of that demographic, it's a tiresome hour and a half. Considering all the refreshing films aimed at this sort of demographic, both live action and animated, to have children suspend reality and pause the real world for Like Mike is an unnecessary move.Is the film harmful? Not in the slightest. To its respect, it is genial and kind, throughout most of its runtime (Despite the total 180 the film takes in a scene where a goon threatens to burn a young kid's only picture of his biological family if he doesn't confess to where Calvin's sneakers are at). But is it particularly ideal for a growing child? I don't believe so. The film treats the real world as if clichés are part of life and how quickly a wholesome story gets opted for one of almost no realism beyond the character's names. If that's what you're looking for, pay no mind to me.The story centers around Calvin Coolidge (Lil' Bow Wow), a young orphan who comes in contact with a magical pair of Nike sneakers with the ambiguous initials "MJ" on them. Well, the only "MJ" Calvin knows is Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls all-star, so that's who it must be. We never do get a straight answer, but I guess a clever assumption is good enough.Calvin realizes that whenever he puts on the shoes, he becomes amazing at basketball. In a very contrived scene where Calvin's ticket number is called when he is lucky enough to go to a basketball game, he winds up beating the own player at his game by scoring three shots on the man.So, he becomes contracted to the Minnesota Timberwolves and starts to befriend their player, Tracy Reynolds (Morris Chestnut), who clearly doesn't want to be befriended. He is an introverted soul, who loves random hookups and hates the thought of seeing any member of his family again, let alone starting his own. When Calvin, Tracy, and the rest of the Timberwolves are not on the court, Calvin tries to get direct access to Tracy's heart.The idea of a young orphan becoming a sports star just because of a pair of sneakers is a little more than far-fetched. I suppose it's an ode to those Nike ads from back in the day that if unsuspecting young-ins bought clothing endorsed by this sports star they would be able to play like that specific star. Speaking of ads, don't even get me started on the shameless way this film is acting as a vehicle for the NBA.We end on a schmaltzy cookie-cutter note and learn next to nothing throughout this whole experience. Like Mike is a child's fantasy come to life, from what I can assume. Personally, I' d rather see my child act out his own unique fantasies than pay money to see Hollywood's take on them. Seems a lot healthier for the both of us.Starring: Lil' Bow Wow, Jonathan Lipnicki, Morris Chestnut, Robert Forster, Crispin Glover, and Eugene Levy. Directed by: John Schultz.

Playing basketball in the schoolyard and with friends is one of the most fun times in our lives as children. The courts are always a welcoming place for both experts and novice, and one where learning and fun are the crux. Like Mike brings the dreams of all our youth and broadcasts it. Living vicariously has never been better.Whether it's the food service, free merchandise or simply having trivial matters no longer be worrisome, playing in the NBA is a dream we all have, albeit for different reasons. Coming from an orphanage, hard work is vital for success (as it is in most cases). When in a position where you're given the reins, you must capitalize. When given MJ's shoes, you make it count. Like Mike is a fun movie. From the very first scene on the playground to the climactic finish, it's the tale about kids being kids, but still managing to play out their dreams.

An unusually strong supporting cast (including Crispin Glover, Robert Forster, Eugene Levy and Anne Meara) enlivens this simple family comedy built around the appealing young actor Lil' Bow Wow. He plays an orphan who, upon finding a magical pair of sneakers, becomes an NBA superstar and in the process befriends another player (Morris Chestnut) with his own family problems.

I'm glad they didn't have Bow Wow dunking too much, because it does look fake.  A good family film.  4/10 Fair

Like just about every other recent pop star before him, Lil' Bow Wow has landed the starring role in a major motion picture. Unlike the rest of them, he has managed to carry a good, clean family film. There's nothing too offensive here and kids of all ages (at least from the test screening) seemed to eat it up. While it's not terribly original (see "Rookie of the Year"), it's not trying to re-invent kids' movies, it's just trying to entertain in a fun, safe way, which it does. Bow (Mr. Wow?) has enough boyish charm and enough charisma to show what could be a promising acting career in addition to his duties as a rapper. Morris Chestnut ("The Brothers") does well as an unwilling mentor who becomes a father figure to the orphaned boy. Crispin Glover is pretty creepy as the greedy "caretaker" of the boy, and Robert Forester and Eugune Levy both have humorous bit parts. Funny cameos by famous basketball players with obviously little acting skills give it an authentic feel.
 While this probably won't do too well with critics, that's not who it was made for. The target audience is young kids and it will work for them. Parents won't have to worry about anything objective, except a questionable scene where Bow climbs an electrical wire in a rainstorm to recover his shoes. It's entertaining for kids and passable for adults taking their children. If this sounds good to you, you'll probably like it. If not, it wasn't made for you anyway.

Extremely funny, lighthearted kids romp with a positive message and enduring theme.  Was pleased seeing a young rapper placed in a non-stereotypical role that valued family and teamwork themes.  The basketball player "big brother" Morris Chestnut worked well as a trouble gifted basketball player who reluctantly takes Bow Wow under his wings and albeit predictable softens up in his parental role with the youngster.  The scene where they paint geometry lessons on the side of his mansion was hilarious and keep up the importance of school!  Kids do the darnest things and I can see a youngster after a pair of magical shoes clinging to a tree in a thunderstorm.  Okay, as a parent thats dangerous and would not want to see my youngster dangling from this tree BUT I do remember my own exploits as a child doing much of the same type of daring challenges.  Kids will be kids so this gives excellent opportunity for the parent to talk with their child about keeping it safe!  The NBA should be elated to have been giving a more good-guy image then their typical bad boy look.  Very satisfied with this film portraying a positive image for my children to watch. Go Ohio!  :)

Like Mike is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot in particular is awful.OK, let me explain the plot of this awful movie. An orphan, played by Lil Bow Wow, finds a pair of shoes that used to belong to Michael Jordan. The shoes git hit by lightning and whenever this kid wears them he has the abilities of Michael Jordan.

Another thing I have an issue with is how good the shoes make this kid. If it gave him the abilities of Michael Jordan, he would not be this good. Do not get me wrong, Jordan is great, but Jordan was not as good as this kid is by wearing the magic shoes. I mean, what type of message is this film supposed to send.

And he never really tells any of the players why he can not play in the playoffs. They do not even care. Horrible.Do not watch this film. Ever.

Like Mike was one of those fun family movies. I never had high expectations of the movie going in and subsequently I was pleasantly surprised. It is no masterpiece, but it is definitely a worthwhile-piece. Bow-Wow was decent as was the script. The movie held an even keel throughout, never getting too dull, but also never having any real riotous moments. Obviously the movie was a bit of a fantasy with a boy finding mystical shoes that gave him the skills of Michael Jordan; but hey, that is what made the movie as good as it was. I like the idea of using a kid as opposed to an adult so as to make the movie more entertaining. In fact, it reminds me of a story I wrote for a sixth grade project. All-in-all, a good movie, certainly better than average.

I've started watching this picture with high hopes, you might ask yourself why? well, as a basketball fan at a hole and a NBA fan particularly I'll tell you that there are'nt as many BBall movies as one can expect, But when such a movie does come out in theaters, it is great like "SpaceJam" and a few more.When I saw this movie I thought it's gonna be another great Basketball film that I could watch again and again, but it's nothing but another kids film: Bow Wow acting was insulting and the NBA players were not used properly.

Not the greatest film of all time, but a very good family film. Everything in the movie is very improbable, but, who cares. It is a film that a family with kids will enjoy. Very simple film with simple characters and a simple plot.

This movie reminded me exactly of the movie 'Rookie of the Year'. It had the same plot basically: A young kid gets the opportunity of a lifetime to be a sports star at such a young age. This was a great movie though! Lil' Bow Wow did a surprisingly great job! And Jonathan Lipnicki was great too! 'Like Mike' is a great film for all ages! It is both uplifting and funny. You'll really enjoy this movie.

It is really sad when a 15 year old kid can ride the coat tales of his uncle (Snoop Dog) not only to a record career but now a film career. This film is the typical tale of a poor kid becoming a star, through of all things, shoes (which he climbs up a tree in the middle of a lightning storm to go get, I am sure parents will love that part). After he gets his magical shoes he becomes a super basketball player. Now if this plot sounds familiar, well it is, it`s call Rookie of the Year and it was done many years ago.To be fair the acting isn`t half bad, I would definitly consider Lil`Bow Wow a better actor than rapper. I do feel bad for his co-star Morris Chestnut who has the look of "I just don`t want to be here" on his face for the entire film. Chesnut is a good actor and deserves more than this. I won tickets to screening of this film, but after watching it I didn`t feel like a winner, I felt like I wanted the 90 minutes of my life back.

I voted on this film only because I came across it while looking for something else and was surprised to discover that IMDb voters have mostly disliked it.This is an utterly silly but utterly charming film.  It does not have a sophisticated bone in its body but it is sweet and funny.  Both my nine year old grandson and I liked it a lot. I recommend it, especially if you can see it with a kid -- 7 out of 10.

Like Mike will most likely be a charmer for kids between the ages of five and ten, to which this movie is naturally targeted towards. As someone speaking well outside of that demographic, it's a tiresome hour and a half. Considering all the refreshing films aimed at this sort of demographic, both live action and animated, to have children suspend reality and pause the real world for Like Mike is an unnecessary move.Is the film harmful? Not in the slightest. To its respect, it is genial and kind, throughout most of its runtime (Despite the total 180 the film takes in a scene where a goon threatens to burn a young kid's only picture of his biological family if he doesn't confess to where Calvin's sneakers are at). But is it particularly ideal for a growing child? I don't believe so. The film treats the real world as if clichés are part of life and how quickly a wholesome story gets opted for one of almost no realism beyond the character's names. If that's what you're looking for, pay no mind to me.The story centers around Calvin Coolidge (Lil' Bow Wow), a young orphan who comes in contact with a magical pair of Nike sneakers with the ambiguous initials "MJ" on them. Well, the only "MJ" Calvin knows is Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls all-star, so that's who it must be. We never do get a straight answer, but I guess a clever assumption is good enough.Calvin realizes that whenever he puts on the shoes, he becomes amazing at basketball. In a very contrived scene where Calvin's ticket number is called when he is lucky enough to go to a basketball game, he winds up beating the own player at his game by scoring three shots on the man.So, he becomes contracted to the Minnesota Timberwolves and starts to befriend their player, Tracy Reynolds (Morris Chestnut), who clearly doesn't want to be befriended. He is an introverted soul, who loves random hookups and hates the thought of seeing any member of his family again, let alone starting his own. When Calvin, Tracy, and the rest of the Timberwolves are not on the court, Calvin tries to get direct access to Tracy's heart.The idea of a young orphan becoming a sports star just because of a pair of sneakers is a little more than far-fetched. I suppose it's an ode to those Nike ads from back in the day that if unsuspecting young-ins bought clothing endorsed by this sports star they would be able to play like that specific star. Speaking of ads, don't even get me started on the shameless way this film is acting as a vehicle for the NBA.We end on a schmaltzy cookie-cutter note and learn next to nothing throughout this whole experience. Like Mike is a child's fantasy come to life, from what I can assume. Personally, I' d rather see my child act out his own unique fantasies than pay money to see Hollywood's take on them. Seems a lot healthier for the both of us.Starring: Lil' Bow Wow, Jonathan Lipnicki, Morris Chestnut, Robert Forster, Crispin Glover, and Eugene Levy. Directed by: John Schultz.

I'm giving this a 10 because in its genre it shines - it really is a great sports movie for kids! Lil Bow Wow is great, very natural, and very likable and the supporting cast all do their thing and make this inoffensive, entertaining, and we found lot of reasons to smile broadly.With LOADS of basketball any kid that likes the game will be happy - of course, teams and players will change, but this is still really fun.It reminded me of the old Disney films where magic, or experiments, gave some special powers and poof! sit back and watch time....Absolutely recommended for kids and parents alike... we all loved this and would watch again.Best thing I can say is that the kids just wanted to run out in the garden and play ball afterward, which is a pretty positive result!!!

This movie at first seemed lame but when I the movie was more into it I started to enjoy it. It may be predictable but it is still a good movie.

Although this movies main characters were likeable enough the movie was a total rip off of the magic football boots movie which I forget the name of.My kid stared blankly at this movie after about ten minutes of it.Deserves to go straight to video.
