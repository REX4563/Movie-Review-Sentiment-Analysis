I went to a small advance screening of this movie on July 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.The plot line really is nothing like I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters. In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or TV. And even though I might have known what was coming at points, I still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.My one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is I can't figure out why.

The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There's a saying, "Not all dreamers achieve, but all achievers dream." By exploring our imagination we shape our own futures. Or build empires. Perhaps overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Gain wisdom and benefit mankind. Or (put simply) just find our way to true love and happiness. Freud might express such things in symbols. The language of fantasy.Tristan ventures out of a rather twee English village called Wall. He goes through a break in the wall. A portal. In search of something that will prove his love to Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria doesn't take him very seriously. So he pledges to bring back a falling star.Stormhold is the world outside the wall. He discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). To complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of Yvaine. If they can eat her heart, it will replenish their youth. (One of the witches is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner.) The 'good guy' they meet on their way is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath. Heirs of Stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the Kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an added extras. A buffoon trader throwing in standard Gervais-type gags well. Tristan's purity of spirit arouses the love of Yvaine, so there is a nice little triangle going. Till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women.Stardust is a full-on, large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars. Wholly positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of Harry Potter romps. Production values rival Hollywood, and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies.That is not to say that Stardust is without its faults. Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this film may well provide it.As a boy, I remember listening in wonder to albums by the Moody Blues (who practiced in a house not far from where I lived). They made records with names like "In Search of the Lost Chord," and wrote lyrics like, "Thinking is the best way to travel." I would fill my head with books on magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Shaping dreams. Learning to make them real. Nowadays people might talk of NLP or positive thinking. Adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity. Do you still enjoy that feeling?You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD. See it on the biggest cinema screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it. The actors look like they had a ball. Maybe you will too.

This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the Neil Gaiman novel which I am now looking to read) and colorful characters.One of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is. Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale, satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel.Original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy.

I like how the characters grow throughout the movie. The fairytale is quite unique, and the movie manage to not bore me the whole time im watching it. Will I watch it again? Yes, I will

This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really make the movie go the distance though. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time. You get to see a whole different side to Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth the price of admission just for that!) All the elements are there from adventure to romance, and well placed comedy.People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects, may be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escapism.Deserves an A. (Hope it does well at the box office)

I came in to this movie not expecting a faithful translation of the book, but a solid movie that kept the spirit and basic plot outline of Neil Gaiman's fantastic fairy tale, Stardust.I was disappointed on both counts.What I loved most about the book (and what made it stand out from other fantasy adventure novels) was the subtlety of the majority of the plot and the human nature of the characters.In the book, the "good" guys were not pure; they made mistakes that were more malicious than clumsy, yet were still likable. Tristran's mother was not pure and good; she wanted an heir, and she got one out of Dunstan. After that, her son was on his own. Yet, even when it does show these moral failures, it doesn't quite show the characters making up for it. Tristran is impossibly blinded by his "love" for Victoria Forester (who wants nothing more than the hand of Tristran's forty-something employer) and captures an innocent and very human star for his own ends. He is redeemed because he trusts her and lets go of the chain himself. This short and simple fact is left out.Subtlety and irony run throughout the story, yet the movie plot is blunt and again, lacks the grace that made the book so wonderful and satisfying. The queen cannot get Yvaine's heart because she has already given it to Tristran, and the elderly witch stops. Tristran's mother's chain is broken when the moon loses her daughter in a week when two Mondays come together, not when Ditchwater Sal is killed.As a movie, it was passable and generally likable. But even so, it was disjointed; the modern-ish concepts such as a cross-dressing captain and various comments throughout the movie seem out of place in a period fantasy piece such as this.

Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007)The marketing machine has only just begun for this one (no site yet? wth?), so I doubt most of you have heard about it. In truth, I hadn't either (sort of). When I got the posting, I thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was Transformers, one of the movies I wanted to see when not working so I can enjoy it 100% as a mere mortal movie-goer. Turns out, it wasn't Transformers and I had been aware of this movie way back when as 'that Neil Gaiman movie'. What is it about? Well, in short, it's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. Any more than that and I'd be giving away plot info which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) spoiling your fun. If you really want to know what it's about, go buy the book. Rumour has it, Gaiman might be something of a writer.Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile. And for this one, it certainly was. This screening was 'special' in that it included not just film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local sci-fi/fantasy folks. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect.Oh how sweetly wrong I was.Yes, it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom (and even books without pictures, if those truly exist). But it was not Lord of Rings. It was not even another Lord of the Rings wannabe (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all that.But, like Lord of the Rings, it was the, well, humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities. It's surely a romantic tale, but with generous splashes of humour. Not slapstick Shrekian humour. It's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy. Before I go on, let's do this movie review thing.Acting is, in the very least, good. It's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but I do believe there were significant superbly acted roles. Michelle Pfieffer is not, sadly, one of those. She plays a villain, and she does the job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, though, he was a real jerk. That is, a great villain. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter frickin' O'Toole -- which is marvellous. Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part. When he wanted to deliver the goods, though, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy I ain't never heard of.Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always been of mixed opinion with her. She can be great, and then she can seem to miss the mark. In this, she's the former. And she is, quite literally, the star of this film. Sure, her accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, she's not as good as she can be when Cox isn't in the scene. However ... well, see for yourself.Special effects are muted yet accomplished, and only significant where they should be. Best flying ship yet -- sorry Potter. Direction is light-hearted and flows nicely. Cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in New Zealand. All else is top bracket.And now that that's done......the writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, you devil. It's hard in today's climate to do anything original and, at first, you begin to wonder. A kingdom, a dying King, a boy out to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) -- what's new? But Gaiman's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart. And, though you suspect how it's all going to turn out, you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you're me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you'll find this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not. Fantastical and real.(I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan but I won't ruin it for you. For those who read the book, rest assured, it's done properly.)Those I spoke to afterwards had the same impression I did. A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because, well, you might be expecting it. You'll know when you walk out, anyway. I sincerely hope Stardust doesn't get lost among the tentpoles. Even if it does, it'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know.---Forgot to add the {WITHHELD} reveal. I'm a few years late, but ... "A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." Perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but I'm still confident that years from now, there will be the same "Oh, I love that movie," response to this as there is now for The Princess Bride.(Edited for grammar and stuff. Still rather spastic in tone and flow. I am not Gaiman. Duh.)

I went into this film with modest hopes, the director had pedigree, I had seen Charlie Cox in Casanova and was impressed, and literally EVERYONE had been raving about it. As the story started to unfold I was introduced to Victorian England on one side of a mysterious Wall, and on the other a magical land, Stormhold. The actual plot weaves together many strands and I don't want to ruin the surprises for anyone, but at the barest it is the simple tale of a young man (Charlie Cox) in love with the village beauty (Sienna Miller). To win her love he tells her he will fetch back a fallen star from the other side of the Wall. Howver when he arrives at the star he finds not a lump of astral metal as he expected but a beautiful woman (Claire Danes). As the two journey back to the wall they find themselves in the adventure of a lifetime. The visuals are brilliant, England looks stunning, in a similar fashion to New Zealand in LOTR, and it s full of wonderful little flourishes, such as the way that the star shines when she is happy, a very simple effect, but one that looks radiant. As well as this the acting good, especially from the leads and Robert DeNiro, whose turn as the captain of an airship is incredibly memorable. This film is THE perfect date movie, it is romantic without being a "chick flick", funny and full of wonderful action pieces that will satisfy any action film fan. All in all it is a truly magical experience from beginning to end, and I now Im raving about it to EVERYONE!

Stardust is a 2007 Fantasy Adventure movie starring Claire Danes,Charlie Cox,Sienna Miller, Robert De Niro and Michelle Pieffer and tells the story of a young man named Tristan(Charlie Cox) who's in love with a woman called Victoria(Sienna Miller) who already has another suitor called Humprey(played by an unreconisable Henry Cavil). In order to win Victoria's heart,Tristian goes on a quest to retrieve the fallen star as Victoria spotted it while Tristian and her were on a date.But when Tristian does go and find the star,it takes on a human form into a beautiful woman called Yvainne(Claire Danes) and at first the two don't get along but romance blossoms between them. When an evil witch(Michelle Pieffer)is looking for Yvainne,it's up to Tristian to protect her from the witch who wants her for eternal youth?Overall I really enjoyed this film as I used to have it on DVD and I bought it again as I hadn't seen it in over 10 years and had it forgotten.
The movie is very dark and the story is dark too yet I thought the acting was good and the chemistry between Charlie Cox and Claire Danes was believable.Also stars Shazam star Mark Strong as one of the heirs of Stormhold and narration from X-Men star Ian McKellan.
7/10

OK here is how I do this. I grade movies on 10 components. Each component will inherently start with 5 points. It can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0.Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. It had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The Action was fun and exiting. The Romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still I was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense.Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. I found my self, sitting in the theatre, returned to my childhood, and in that instant I again believed in unicorns, wicked witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true.Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points. While the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles, I found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera.FX - I give this component 10 points. I love that they used C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. All in all less is more, and this had it ALL! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and seasoned actors alike, the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked, Charlie Cox made Tristan come to life, Claire Danes gave emotion to the stars, and I will never look and Robert De Niro the same again.Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. Once again, I will NEVER look and Robert De Niro the same again.Character development - I give this component 9 points. This felt a little rushed and I think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was smart, witty, fun even the mush had good dialogue.Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie. I am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable.Ending - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect ending! I feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more subdued, but no threads were left untied.Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES! See it in the Theatre? Most definitely! Bottom Line: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre, I know I'll be going back for seconds!

The reason I say indirect because this movie actually has a purpose besides just being funny. As well the humor is never just over the top but simple and in the correct places.The combination of the entire story makes this a movie for pretty much anyone not just a certain group of movie goers. With just enough special effects actions while not over doing it, each part of the experience actually compliments itself. From what I could remember there wasn't anything but good acting within the movie. Not that you couldn't expect much less from Robert Deniro or Michelle Phieffer. But the rest of the cast and even the small parts were written and accomplished well.This could be probably the best attempt I have seen to repeat the greatness of one of the most underrated movies of all time. The Princess Bride.

I was not expecting much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just gotten off of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex.Once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie, getting more and more excited with each minute passing. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic. The actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical.

'Stardust' is truly a great movie. Oh, I absolutely loved it. Perhaps the plot was a bit thin, but that didn't bother me at all. Just a guy trying to find his way home, with a little mishaps on the way - but really, that is the plot in a lot of books and films. It was very cute, I think. It made me feel ... well, good inside. It was also very funny, very touching, very interesting, very ... good. I'm a bit hopeless at describing the movie today, but what I'm trying to say is, that this film is worth seeing. And worth seeing more than once.I saw it the day after it came out here in Denmark, and I think I will go see it again, sometime soon. Tickets to a movie cost a fortune here, but I liked it so much that my pockets have to empty a little, but for a good cause. Well, a good laugh, a good experience. I enjoyed it so very much. Actually, after I came home, I went straight to the library to borrow the book, it is based on. Perhaps I can relive the experience of this great story. I sure hope so. It was, and is, absolutely wonderful! Do go and see it. See it again, perhaps again ... and then again.

Forget the Hollywood hype. Stardust is no Princess Bride. Having read and immensely enjoyed the novel, Stardust, by Neil Gaiman, I can sum up the film in just two simple words; magic lost.It's hard for me to imagine that Neil Gaiman had anything to do with this filmlet alone the fact that he was a producer. I must admit that I was angry during the beginning of the film and found myself slowly accepting the reality that the film's narrative was failing to stay true to its literary counterpart.Whatever happened to Tristran's one ear that was pointy and elfish as well as the reasons behind it? Why didn't we get to see how he was treated differently by his peers in Wall? Why didn't we learn the reason why Tristran's father, Dunstan, purchased the snowdrop (glass flower) from the gypsy girl who was the witch's slave? Why weren't we treated to the delicate love scene (as far as PG-13 will allow), between Dunstan and the gypsy girl, which resulted in the birth of Tristran? Why weren't we treated to the wonderful and mysterious goings on at the Faerie Market by all of the vendors and spectators who traveled so far to be there? In the book, vendors shouted, "Eyes, eyes! New eyes for old!", "Instruments of music from a hundred lands!", "Try your luck! Step right up!", "Everlasting lavender!", "Bottled dreams, a shilling a bottle!", "Swords of fortune!" and "Wands of power!" Inarguably, this would have lent such a magical feel and sense of wonder to the Faerie Market. Why weren't we told that this very special Faerie Market only took place every nine years? Most importantly, why didn't we get to see the reason why Tristran was granted entrance into the land of Faerie? Finally, why did the filmmakers leave out the hairy little elfin man who helped Tristran get around in the land of Faerie as well as the little faerie folk? Instead of the beautifully crafted narrative in the novel (which so eloquently and effectively establishes a fantastical yet very romantic time and place during the Victorian era), the film speeds past important story elementsthus, leaving us with contrivance and an empty feeling which makes us not care so deeply for the main characters.Let's face it, Stardust will never reach a very high "rewatchability factor" that The Princess Bride has earned. There were no magic moments in Stardust to remember endearingly and no witty lines of dialogue to repeat over and over with friends like, "As you wish.", "Inconceivable!" and "My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." The Stardust script was a mess and simply could not hold a candle to that of The Princess Bride. Undoubtedly, William Goldman is a true genius and an extremely gifted writer. Both his novel, The Princess Bride, and his screenplay adaptation, are far beyond compare. In the novel, and the film, The Princess Bride, one is captivated by the rich characters and their motivations. In addition, the comedic elements in The Princess Bride are priceless with several laugh out loud moments. None of this can be said of Stardust. In fact, Stardust fails miserably in the comedic department. (Honestly, a cross-dressing gay sky pirate?) The comedic elements seemed to have been thrown in haphazardly and were ill-timed at that. Perhaps more comedy would have been inspired if Rupert Everett's character wasn't killed off so suddenly.Even the characters of time and place were not fully developed as in The Princess Bride. One never feels a connection to Wall or to Stormhold like we are of Florin and Guilder in The Princess Bride. In addition, other wonderful characters of Stardust were either small caricatures or just plain eliminated from the film! The mother who raised Tristran as her own was non-existent in the film. Even Tristran's father's character, Dunstan, was pretty much left in the dust. Even the way Tristran first encounters Yvaine, the fallen star, is ridiculous to say the least! Tristran's entire journey to reach the fallen star was skipped over completely. Instead of a rough, perilous journey, Tristran is suddenly 'beamed' to the star's landing spot viaCGI! What a rip. At least in The Princess Bride, we were treated to the journey as well as the narrow escapes of the Eels, Cliffs of Insanity, the Fire Swamp, Quick Sand and the triumph over the R.O.U.S.'s (Rodents of Unusual Size).Is there anything redeeming about the film? Michele Pfeiffer makes a darn good wicked witch. That's it, really. Robert De Niro was OK in his role. He was the only real comedic relief in the film and, even here, his lines of dialogue were mediocre at best. Charlie Cox was no Westley and Claire Danes was no Princess Buttercup.The film was choppy and, for the most part, the characters were like 'walking stick figures'. The make-up and costume departments did a fine job. However, the special effects were not that spectacular and did not compensate for the lack of development for either the characters or storyline. At many points, the film's score was so over the top and dramatic that it didn't fit the scene.In the end, the mistake was putting two novices on this projectthe director, Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake), and first-time screenwriter, Jane Goldman. And, it showed. (Let's face it, they hired the wrong Goldman!) I blame Paramount and Neil Gaiman, equally, for not choosing a better team. Rob Reiner (The Princess Bride), Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings) or Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands) would have been infinitely superior choices for director. (Neil, you should have adapted your own screenplay like William Goldman did!) Even Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer could not save this film. I truly believe that the studio knew Stardust was in trouble to some degree. The August release date of the film is rather telling. Paramount only wishes Stardust were the next Princess Bride.

I went to a small advance screening of this movie on July 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.The plot line really is nothing like I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters. In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or TV. And even though I might have known what was coming at points, I still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.My one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is I can't figure out why.

The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.

Surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The characters were really well developed, the world building was fantastic and the action was really enjoyable. Mark Strong is great as ever as the villain, but it has to be Robert DeNiro who just steals the film in the weirdest role I could think of for him. The story is genuinely intriguing, but it's the world building that really did it for me. I really felt immersed in this fantasy world, and the exposition was delivered really naturally. As much as I have gripes with some of Matthew Vaughn's films, the actual direction is never the issue, and it's quite good here too. Now my main issue is that the film is trying to juggle quite a lot of storylines, and it feels a bit rushed as a result. You could probably cut Michelle Pfieffer's plotline down quite a bit in order to concentrate on the main storyline more. But overall, this is a surprisingly fun film that I would definitely recommend

Why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome!! Everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. It is engaging and funny from moment one, original, and well-acted. I wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves!For anyone that loved The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the great ones. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. There are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters...even down to facial expressions.

I was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film.Stardust follows Tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold.This film was just a joy to watch, it has something in it for everyone, all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny. If I had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be The Princess Bride, a classic.All the performances are outstanding, the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her portrayal of Yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as Larnia...but the performance to talk about is Robert De Niro...In every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show...If you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film. Guys don't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout. The cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film...nothing about the film seems forced.

This fantastic picture concerns a Tristan (Charlie Cox) , a young living in an English village rounded by a wall . But a breach surveyed by a keeper (David Kelly) is the walk for a world fantasy named Stronhold . Tristan trespasses the breach looking for a fallen star (which results to be Ivaine : Claire Danes) to demonstrate his love for a beautiful girl (Sienna Miller). But also a nasty witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the King's (Peter O'Toole) heirs (Mark Strong , Rupert Everett) are looking for Ivaine and the jewel she holds . Meanwhile , Tristan and Ivaine get away and aboard a flying vessel full of pirates (Dexter Fletcher , Fogerty) and commanded by a sympathetic captain (Robert De Niro).This exciting motion picture displays derring-do adventure , romance , fairy tale , spectacular fighting and fence and with phenomenal outdoors . The flick gets lots of bombastic special effects including supernatural transformations , flying ships , stars explosions and numerous images have you on the edge of your seat . Riveting set pieces illuminate the full-blown adventures blending witchcraft , wizardry , necromancy and turns out to be extremely amusing . Casting is frankly extraordinary , Michelle Pfeiffer plays magnificently a shamelessly villain-witch and Robert De Niro as the likable gay pirate steals the show . Ideal cast is completed by awesome US and British actors . The movie packs a sensational production design by Gavin Bouquet (Star wars). Mesmerizing photography with wonderful , marvelous landscapes by Ben Davis . Emotive soundtrack appropriately adequate to fantasy by Eshkeri . The pic was brilliantly directed by Matthew Vaughn . He's a good writer, producer (Guy Ritchie movies) and director, though only made one film titled ¨Layer Cake¨ (with Daniel Craig) which achieved big time . Rating : Better than average. Essential and indispensable watching.

The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There's a saying, "Not all dreamers achieve, but all achievers dream." By exploring our imagination we shape our own futures. Or build empires. Perhaps overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Gain wisdom and benefit mankind. Or (put simply) just find our way to true love and happiness. Freud might express such things in symbols. The language of fantasy.Tristan ventures out of a rather twee English village called Wall. He goes through a break in the wall. A portal. In search of something that will prove his love to Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria doesn't take him very seriously. So he pledges to bring back a falling star.Stormhold is the world outside the wall. He discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). To complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of Yvaine. If they can eat her heart, it will replenish their youth. (One of the witches is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner.) The 'good guy' they meet on their way is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath. Heirs of Stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the Kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an added extras. A buffoon trader throwing in standard Gervais-type gags well. Tristan's purity of spirit arouses the love of Yvaine, so there is a nice little triangle going. Till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women.Stardust is a full-on, large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars. Wholly positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of Harry Potter romps. Production values rival Hollywood, and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies.That is not to say that Stardust is without its faults. Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this film may well provide it.As a boy, I remember listening in wonder to albums by the Moody Blues (who practiced in a house not far from where I lived). They made records with names like "In Search of the Lost Chord," and wrote lyrics like, "Thinking is the best way to travel." I would fill my head with books on magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Shaping dreams. Learning to make them real. Nowadays people might talk of NLP or positive thinking. Adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity. Do you still enjoy that feeling?You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD. See it on the biggest cinema screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it. The actors look like they had a ball. Maybe you will too.

Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to fetch her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning Claire Danes. Not much suspense on what happens with these two, but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince son of King Peter O'Toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our "star" is wearing. Lots of bad chasing the good.Along the way, an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see (including any from the Carribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.Not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director Matthew Vaughn's ("Layer Cake") effort deserves an audience. Sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. My guess it will find big success on video.

This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the Neil Gaiman novel which I am now looking to read) and colorful characters.One of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is. Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale, satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel.Original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy.

'Stardust' was a splendid watch. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it turned out to be. To me, it seemed like just another passable fantasy flick but 'Stardust' is a lot more than one might expect. It is a fairy tale about a fallen star and a young boy. Vaughn's direction is solid. The visuals are fascinating, even though sometimes the CGI is obvious. The cinematography is stunning and the soundtrack is beautiful. The writing is commendable and the dialogues are fine.Comparisions might be made with 'Lord of The Rings'. While I did not like Peter Jackson's movie as much as others did, I throughly enjoyed 'Stardust'. However, 'Stardust' too has its share of flaws. I thought the ending (in spite of some humorous moments) was a little dragged on and gave the film a fluffy touch. The American actors act very well but some of them lose the British accent at times (at one point Michelle Pfeiffer pronounces the 'r') but this is a very very minor case and the reason why I mention it is because it was something I noticed. This minor point does not make me like the film any less but the unnecessarily stretched ending somewhat does.'Stardust' boasts of a stellar cast that comprises of both British and American talents. The luminous Claire Danes and the naive Charlie Cox have the right chemistry and look convincing on screen. Danes is literally and metaphorically the star of the film. Michelle Pfeiffer springs a surprise performance as the evil villainess. It's great to see her after a long time, that too in a completely different role which she effortlessly pulls off. Robert De Niro too springs a surprise. I won't say much about him because that would be ruining the fun. Let me just say this much that perhaps one will never look at Mr. De Niro the same way. Notice the welcoming cameos that include a magnificent Peter O'Toole, a funnily odd Dexter Fletcher, a hilarious Ricky Gervais and a pitiful Rupert Everett.There are so many wonderfully shot scenes. I particularly liked the pre-climax scene where Yvaine is approaching towards the wall and the camera switches back and forth to the different characters. The cinematography and music add power to that key scene. Of course there are many other such great scenes but this was one I freshly remembered. The scenes between Tristan and Yvaine are quite nice and fun and thankfully they are not overly sugarcoated (except in the end). The light comedy is quite cleverly put and special thanks to De Niro and his pirates, the 6 (?) ghosts and Gervais for pulling them off.On the whole, 'Stardust' is a wonderful film. As stated earlier, i would have liked it more had the ending been a little crisp. Nonetheless, it felt like two hours well spent and I recommend it to those who enjoy original fantasies.

I like how the characters grow throughout the movie. The fairytale is quite unique, and the movie manage to not bore me the whole time im watching it. Will I watch it again? Yes, I will

This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really make the movie go the distance though. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time. You get to see a whole different side to Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth the price of admission just for that!) All the elements are there from adventure to romance, and well placed comedy.People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects, may be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escapism.Deserves an A. (Hope it does well at the box office)

This movie is very well made. Great cast with both the celebrities you know and those you don't. It has an exceptional score to go with it. Unfortunately I'm just not a fan of pure fantasy and that's most of what story has to offer. Expect a cross between Star War optimism and Lord of the Rings fantasy. It's a fairly bright and positive movie despite the antagonists in the plot. This movie delivered everything right whereas a movie like Eragon failed miserably. If you prefer movies grounded in reality and science, this isn't a movie for you. If you like a fantasy getaway where anything is possible, you can't find much better. Overall it's worth the money, but I wouldn't want to see it again. It has a few too many silly moments and almost qualifies as a comedy. I see no need to rush to a theater. Best suited for a DVD rental.

I came in to this movie not expecting a faithful translation of the book, but a solid movie that kept the spirit and basic plot outline of Neil Gaiman's fantastic fairy tale, Stardust.I was disappointed on both counts.What I loved most about the book (and what made it stand out from other fantasy adventure novels) was the subtlety of the majority of the plot and the human nature of the characters.In the book, the "good" guys were not pure; they made mistakes that were more malicious than clumsy, yet were still likable. Tristran's mother was not pure and good; she wanted an heir, and she got one out of Dunstan. After that, her son was on his own. Yet, even when it does show these moral failures, it doesn't quite show the characters making up for it. Tristran is impossibly blinded by his "love" for Victoria Forester (who wants nothing more than the hand of Tristran's forty-something employer) and captures an innocent and very human star for his own ends. He is redeemed because he trusts her and lets go of the chain himself. This short and simple fact is left out.Subtlety and irony run throughout the story, yet the movie plot is blunt and again, lacks the grace that made the book so wonderful and satisfying. The queen cannot get Yvaine's heart because she has already given it to Tristran, and the elderly witch stops. Tristran's mother's chain is broken when the moon loses her daughter in a week when two Mondays come together, not when Ditchwater Sal is killed.As a movie, it was passable and generally likable. But even so, it was disjointed; the modern-ish concepts such as a cross-dressing captain and various comments throughout the movie seem out of place in a period fantasy piece such as this.

Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007)The marketing machine has only just begun for this one (no site yet? wth?), so I doubt most of you have heard about it. In truth, I hadn't either (sort of). When I got the posting, I thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was Transformers, one of the movies I wanted to see when not working so I can enjoy it 100% as a mere mortal movie-goer. Turns out, it wasn't Transformers and I had been aware of this movie way back when as 'that Neil Gaiman movie'. What is it about? Well, in short, it's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. Any more than that and I'd be giving away plot info which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) spoiling your fun. If you really want to know what it's about, go buy the book. Rumour has it, Gaiman might be something of a writer.Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile. And for this one, it certainly was. This screening was 'special' in that it included not just film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local sci-fi/fantasy folks. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect.Oh how sweetly wrong I was.Yes, it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom (and even books without pictures, if those truly exist). But it was not Lord of Rings. It was not even another Lord of the Rings wannabe (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all that.But, like Lord of the Rings, it was the, well, humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities. It's surely a romantic tale, but with generous splashes of humour. Not slapstick Shrekian humour. It's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy. Before I go on, let's do this movie review thing.Acting is, in the very least, good. It's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but I do believe there were significant superbly acted roles. Michelle Pfieffer is not, sadly, one of those. She plays a villain, and she does the job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, though, he was a real jerk. That is, a great villain. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter frickin' O'Toole -- which is marvellous. Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part. When he wanted to deliver the goods, though, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy I ain't never heard of.Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always been of mixed opinion with her. She can be great, and then she can seem to miss the mark. In this, she's the former. And she is, quite literally, the star of this film. Sure, her accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, she's not as good as she can be when Cox isn't in the scene. However ... well, see for yourself.Special effects are muted yet accomplished, and only significant where they should be. Best flying ship yet -- sorry Potter. Direction is light-hearted and flows nicely. Cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in New Zealand. All else is top bracket.And now that that's done......the writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, you devil. It's hard in today's climate to do anything original and, at first, you begin to wonder. A kingdom, a dying King, a boy out to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) -- what's new? But Gaiman's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart. And, though you suspect how it's all going to turn out, you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you're me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you'll find this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not. Fantastical and real.(I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan but I won't ruin it for you. For those who read the book, rest assured, it's done properly.)Those I spoke to afterwards had the same impression I did. A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because, well, you might be expecting it. You'll know when you walk out, anyway. I sincerely hope Stardust doesn't get lost among the tentpoles. Even if it does, it'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know.---Forgot to add the {WITHHELD} reveal. I'm a few years late, but ... "A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." Perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but I'm still confident that years from now, there will be the same "Oh, I love that movie," response to this as there is now for The Princess Bride.(Edited for grammar and stuff. Still rather spastic in tone and flow. I am not Gaiman. Duh.)

I went into this film with modest hopes, the director had pedigree, I had seen Charlie Cox in Casanova and was impressed, and literally EVERYONE had been raving about it. As the story started to unfold I was introduced to Victorian England on one side of a mysterious Wall, and on the other a magical land, Stormhold. The actual plot weaves together many strands and I don't want to ruin the surprises for anyone, but at the barest it is the simple tale of a young man (Charlie Cox) in love with the village beauty (Sienna Miller). To win her love he tells her he will fetch back a fallen star from the other side of the Wall. Howver when he arrives at the star he finds not a lump of astral metal as he expected but a beautiful woman (Claire Danes). As the two journey back to the wall they find themselves in the adventure of a lifetime. The visuals are brilliant, England looks stunning, in a similar fashion to New Zealand in LOTR, and it s full of wonderful little flourishes, such as the way that the star shines when she is happy, a very simple effect, but one that looks radiant. As well as this the acting good, especially from the leads and Robert DeNiro, whose turn as the captain of an airship is incredibly memorable. This film is THE perfect date movie, it is romantic without being a "chick flick", funny and full of wonderful action pieces that will satisfy any action film fan. All in all it is a truly magical experience from beginning to end, and I now Im raving about it to EVERYONE!

What it takes to make a and to tell tale? To tell it with all passion you possess? What it takes, to create a story for children and their parents, without pompous moralistic lectures and banal cliché-like preachments? I guess, it requires sincerity, straight from you heart and soul. Sincerity, that can not be faked. And Stardust  is a perfect example of Tale from big "T"-letter. It reminds literally brilliance of Astrid Lindgren, Tuwe Jansson or Alexander Milne. It has actor's sparkling performance (Peter O'Tool, Rober DeNiro Do I need to continue? ), astonishing special effects (a good tale requires magic, isn't it?) and kindness  kindness that nowadays lacks so bad. There were Never-ending Story. Now it's a Stardust. A good tale never dies, because hope is indeed immortal.

Stardust is a 2007 Fantasy Adventure movie starring Claire Danes,Charlie Cox,Sienna Miller, Robert De Niro and Michelle Pieffer and tells the story of a young man named Tristan(Charlie Cox) who's in love with a woman called Victoria(Sienna Miller) who already has another suitor called Humprey(played by an unreconisable Henry Cavil). In order to win Victoria's heart,Tristian goes on a quest to retrieve the fallen star as Victoria spotted it while Tristian and her were on a date.But when Tristian does go and find the star,it takes on a human form into a beautiful woman called Yvainne(Claire Danes) and at first the two don't get along but romance blossoms between them. When an evil witch(Michelle Pieffer)is looking for Yvainne,it's up to Tristian to protect her from the witch who wants her for eternal youth?Overall I really enjoyed this film as I used to have it on DVD and I bought it again as I hadn't seen it in over 10 years and had it forgotten.
The movie is very dark and the story is dark too yet I thought the acting was good and the chemistry between Charlie Cox and Claire Danes was believable.Also stars Shazam star Mark Strong as one of the heirs of Stormhold and narration from X-Men star Ian McKellan.
7/10

OK here is how I do this. I grade movies on 10 components. Each component will inherently start with 5 points. It can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0.Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. It had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The Action was fun and exiting. The Romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still I was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense.Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. I found my self, sitting in the theatre, returned to my childhood, and in that instant I again believed in unicorns, wicked witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true.Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points. While the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles, I found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera.FX - I give this component 10 points. I love that they used C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. All in all less is more, and this had it ALL! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and seasoned actors alike, the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked, Charlie Cox made Tristan come to life, Claire Danes gave emotion to the stars, and I will never look and Robert De Niro the same again.Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. Once again, I will NEVER look and Robert De Niro the same again.Character development - I give this component 9 points. This felt a little rushed and I think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was smart, witty, fun even the mush had good dialogue.Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie. I am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable.Ending - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect ending! I feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more subdued, but no threads were left untied.Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES! See it in the Theatre? Most definitely! Bottom Line: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre, I know I'll be going back for seconds!

The reason I say indirect because this movie actually has a purpose besides just being funny. As well the humor is never just over the top but simple and in the correct places.The combination of the entire story makes this a movie for pretty much anyone not just a certain group of movie goers. With just enough special effects actions while not over doing it, each part of the experience actually compliments itself. From what I could remember there wasn't anything but good acting within the movie. Not that you couldn't expect much less from Robert Deniro or Michelle Phieffer. But the rest of the cast and even the small parts were written and accomplished well.This could be probably the best attempt I have seen to repeat the greatness of one of the most underrated movies of all time. The Princess Bride.

I was not expecting much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just gotten off of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex.Once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie, getting more and more excited with each minute passing. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic. The actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical.

'Stardust' is truly a great movie. Oh, I absolutely loved it. Perhaps the plot was a bit thin, but that didn't bother me at all. Just a guy trying to find his way home, with a little mishaps on the way - but really, that is the plot in a lot of books and films. It was very cute, I think. It made me feel ... well, good inside. It was also very funny, very touching, very interesting, very ... good. I'm a bit hopeless at describing the movie today, but what I'm trying to say is, that this film is worth seeing. And worth seeing more than once.I saw it the day after it came out here in Denmark, and I think I will go see it again, sometime soon. Tickets to a movie cost a fortune here, but I liked it so much that my pockets have to empty a little, but for a good cause. Well, a good laugh, a good experience. I enjoyed it so very much. Actually, after I came home, I went straight to the library to borrow the book, it is based on. Perhaps I can relive the experience of this great story. I sure hope so. It was, and is, absolutely wonderful! Do go and see it. See it again, perhaps again ... and then again.

When I saw the previews for this movie I knew I'd love it but I had no idea how much I'd love it - This movie is so entertaining - A young man sets out on a quest to find a star to bring to his "Crush/Love interest" to win her hand in marriage - Little does he know, He is not the only one chasing the star - Brothers fighting for the throne are after it - and Some witches want the star - Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert Deniro, and Claire Danes - are the bigger names - And boy do they play their parts well (Especially Ms Pfeiffer) - Magic, betrayal, and love are only a portion of what's in store for you when you watch this movie - Trust me it's a must see - Very original and entertaining from beginning to finish -

Surprisingly good. I watched this based solely on the high IMDB score and, as usual, it was legit. A really enjoyable take on a fairy tale adventure story without sci-fi and with just enough CGI effects to enhance the feel and the magic. It should be more well known than it is.

Forget the Hollywood hype. Stardust is no Princess Bride. Having read and immensely enjoyed the novel, Stardust, by Neil Gaiman, I can sum up the film in just two simple words; magic lost.It's hard for me to imagine that Neil Gaiman had anything to do with this filmlet alone the fact that he was a producer. I must admit that I was angry during the beginning of the film and found myself slowly accepting the reality that the film's narrative was failing to stay true to its literary counterpart.Whatever happened to Tristran's one ear that was pointy and elfish as well as the reasons behind it? Why didn't we get to see how he was treated differently by his peers in Wall? Why didn't we learn the reason why Tristran's father, Dunstan, purchased the snowdrop (glass flower) from the gypsy girl who was the witch's slave? Why weren't we treated to the delicate love scene (as far as PG-13 will allow), between Dunstan and the gypsy girl, which resulted in the birth of Tristran? Why weren't we treated to the wonderful and mysterious goings on at the Faerie Market by all of the vendors and spectators who traveled so far to be there? In the book, vendors shouted, "Eyes, eyes! New eyes for old!", "Instruments of music from a hundred lands!", "Try your luck! Step right up!", "Everlasting lavender!", "Bottled dreams, a shilling a bottle!", "Swords of fortune!" and "Wands of power!" Inarguably, this would have lent such a magical feel and sense of wonder to the Faerie Market. Why weren't we told that this very special Faerie Market only took place every nine years? Most importantly, why didn't we get to see the reason why Tristran was granted entrance into the land of Faerie? Finally, why did the filmmakers leave out the hairy little elfin man who helped Tristran get around in the land of Faerie as well as the little faerie folk? Instead of the beautifully crafted narrative in the novel (which so eloquently and effectively establishes a fantastical yet very romantic time and place during the Victorian era), the film speeds past important story elementsthus, leaving us with contrivance and an empty feeling which makes us not care so deeply for the main characters.Let's face it, Stardust will never reach a very high "rewatchability factor" that The Princess Bride has earned. There were no magic moments in Stardust to remember endearingly and no witty lines of dialogue to repeat over and over with friends like, "As you wish.", "Inconceivable!" and "My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." The Stardust script was a mess and simply could not hold a candle to that of The Princess Bride. Undoubtedly, William Goldman is a true genius and an extremely gifted writer. Both his novel, The Princess Bride, and his screenplay adaptation, are far beyond compare. In the novel, and the film, The Princess Bride, one is captivated by the rich characters and their motivations. In addition, the comedic elements in The Princess Bride are priceless with several laugh out loud moments. None of this can be said of Stardust. In fact, Stardust fails miserably in the comedic department. (Honestly, a cross-dressing gay sky pirate?) The comedic elements seemed to have been thrown in haphazardly and were ill-timed at that. Perhaps more comedy would have been inspired if Rupert Everett's character wasn't killed off so suddenly.Even the characters of time and place were not fully developed as in The Princess Bride. One never feels a connection to Wall or to Stormhold like we are of Florin and Guilder in The Princess Bride. In addition, other wonderful characters of Stardust were either small caricatures or just plain eliminated from the film! The mother who raised Tristran as her own was non-existent in the film. Even Tristran's father's character, Dunstan, was pretty much left in the dust. Even the way Tristran first encounters Yvaine, the fallen star, is ridiculous to say the least! Tristran's entire journey to reach the fallen star was skipped over completely. Instead of a rough, perilous journey, Tristran is suddenly 'beamed' to the star's landing spot viaCGI! What a rip. At least in The Princess Bride, we were treated to the journey as well as the narrow escapes of the Eels, Cliffs of Insanity, the Fire Swamp, Quick Sand and the triumph over the R.O.U.S.'s (Rodents of Unusual Size).Is there anything redeeming about the film? Michele Pfeiffer makes a darn good wicked witch. That's it, really. Robert De Niro was OK in his role. He was the only real comedic relief in the film and, even here, his lines of dialogue were mediocre at best. Charlie Cox was no Westley and Claire Danes was no Princess Buttercup.The film was choppy and, for the most part, the characters were like 'walking stick figures'. The make-up and costume departments did a fine job. However, the special effects were not that spectacular and did not compensate for the lack of development for either the characters or storyline. At many points, the film's score was so over the top and dramatic that it didn't fit the scene.In the end, the mistake was putting two novices on this projectthe director, Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake), and first-time screenwriter, Jane Goldman. And, it showed. (Let's face it, they hired the wrong Goldman!) I blame Paramount and Neil Gaiman, equally, for not choosing a better team. Rob Reiner (The Princess Bride), Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings) or Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands) would have been infinitely superior choices for director. (Neil, you should have adapted your own screenplay like William Goldman did!) Even Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer could not save this film. I truly believe that the studio knew Stardust was in trouble to some degree. The August release date of the film is rather telling. Paramount only wishes Stardust were the next Princess Bride.
