Fun and harmless remake of the popular 1977 Disney film of the same name.Jamie and Lindsay star as a mother and teenage daughter, who don't exactly see eye to eye. They constantly argue and don't understand each others livelihoods and problems in any way shape or form. That is of course until they are magically transferred into each others bodies for a day with genuinely funny consequences.Despite the over familiarity of this type of subject, it is handed with real skill and does more than enough to have you chuckling throughout and basically watching the stars make fools of themselves! Lindsay Lohan is great, but the real star of the show is Jamie Lee Curtis in her best performance for years, she clearly enjoys herself in her role as mother (and daughter!!).

Freaky Friday is an underrated Disney flick with a surprisingly sharp script and plenty of great laugh-out-loud moments. It's a good time.

I enjoyed this film, and I do slightly prefer it to the Jodie Foster version. True, the first 15 minutes were a bit slow, and some of the script was a bit weak, not to mention the rather predictable storyline. But you know what, the performances of Lindsey Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis more than compensated, their performances were really entertaining, and I felt the chemistry between them. I loved the soundtrack, and I thought it was very sensible updating the story, so that it would appeal more to someone like my 13 year old sister, who really enjoyed it. The script, while contrived in some places, was on the whole, very funny, and anyone who's seen the 1976 film, will get a more of the same film, except updated. What I did like, is that Lohan's character is a representation of all of us, someone who doesn't do mornings, doesn't always get on with her mum, and has friends and enemies. In the 1976 version, Jodie Foster's interpretation was more sensible than Lohan's, who put a bit of her other films in, which is quite appealing for this sort of film. Overall, an enjoyable film, with a 7/10. Bethany Cox

To make Freaky Friday work perfectly; you would have to believe that Jamie Lee Curtis is Lindsay Lohan and Lindsay Lohan is Jamie Lee Curtis. Although at times it seemed that way, at other times, it just seemed like Lohan was trying to be Curtis and Curtis was trying to be Lohan. Any way you look at it, Freaky Friday is a family-friendly film that tries to please everyone, and does. It pleases shallow teen prep girls because of Chad Michael Murray. It pleases teen boys because of Lindsay Lohan. It pleases older men because of a Jamie Lee Curtis thong shot. It pleases older women because of Mark Harmon. It pleases the whole family, being that they already saw Finding Nemo and it's the only other family movie out there.Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) (changed from Ellen Andrews from the novel by Mary Rodgers) is a harried psychiatrist who still has time for her family. Anna Colemen (Lohan) (changed from Annabel Andrews) is supposed to be a typical teenager (but is anything but), and has daily fights with her younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) (changed from Ben Andrews). Tess is going to marry Ryan (Harmon), because her husband died three years ago (can't there be a Disney movie with both parents still alive?), of whom Anna doesn't approve. After a fueled feud, Tess and Anna open fortune cookies that switch bodies: Tess is in Anna's body, and vice versa. Whatever will be done?Although most people have praised Curtis for her accurate portrayal of a typical teen (although with the people at my school, what she does is anything but typical), and she should be, Lohan does better at being an adult. If Lohan, a teenager, could be an adult so well, that's rather scary. I thought at most times Lohan was Tess, but Curtis was having too much fun as Anna to really be thought of as great. Instead of acting like Lohan, Curtis just acts like a young kid who just ate too much ice cream.One part of Freaky Friday that I didn't like is how often we were put in an awkward situation. And when they were there, they just didn't seem plausible. All of a sudden, Anna-as-Tess is a guest on a talk show, talks to someone she has a crush on, and watches Tess-as-Anna perform? Not only were they awkward, they were just not believable. On the other hand, Freaky Friday not only has some genuinely funny moments, but is also quite touching at times. Obviously, it was going to be, and Tess and Anna were going to learn to respect each other, considering it was shown in the trailer.One other part I didn't like was how far it strayed from the book. It only focused on Anna-as-Tess (Annabel-as-Ellen), and how she spent her day. Of course, back then she was a housewife, but now she has to be a successful doctor. I do admire it for changing it, unlike others, which is basically watching the book. Overall, Freaky Friday is a likable, pleasant 90-minute diverter. It won't change your life, but you won't be upset you saw it.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some language.

Freaky Friday has just the right touch. In making an identity-switch movie, there is always the temptation to overdo things, in both the comedy and the pathos sides. Jamie Lee Curtis has just about the right balance portraying a 15-year-old in a 40-year-old body. On the comedy side, although on occasions coming across as just a little bit too silly, Curtis has on the whole brought out the funny side of the situation without undue exaggeration. The important thing is her success in making the whole thing believable. On the pathos side, her toasting speech in the engagement ceremony is touching performance. Lindsay Logan, on the other hand, has much less opportunity of repeating her brilliant performance in The Parent Trap (1998). The fault is not hers. It's just that it's much less fun watching a 40-year-old in a 15-year-old body than the other way around. While this is obviously the ladies' show, the two beaus provide reliable support. However, it is the fantastic pair of grandpa (Harold Gould) and little brother (Ryan Malgarini) who stole the show, particularly the little guy. I for one would love to see a sequel with this pair swapping bodies. Good flick; well worth the admission price.

Really good watch, will watch again, and can recommend.I'm not sure what it is about this movie, but it's just an easy, fun watch. Jamie Lee Curtis is a seasoned actress, and Lindsey Lohan had finally built enough experience to be reliable in this role where she's basically doing an impression of Jamie Lee Curtis being her mom. I'm not a huge fan of either one, but I'm not going to deny their acting "chops" and they bring it here, giving the audience a natural and fun atmosphere to the dilemma.There are several very good improvements on original movie in this: cutting a lot of the thought narrative, adding a medium for the swap magic, having them wake up different instead of insta-switching, and several of the added plot lines really help fill out the world better. A career woman is more interesting to follow than a housewife (not that it's necessarily more important), the romance line(s) in this are surprising and slightly less creepy, and swapping a sports game out for musical show not only allowed for the cross competition between character events, but also allows for some great alt rock music throughout the movie: I'll admit to enjoying a movie more when I can relate to the music better.There are several good supporting actors (big and small), to include the Chinese restaurant family which, I think is a very nice cherry on top of the story. By having the source of the magic be an outside party, I think it helps the complexity of the story without causing confusion.It's a fun watch, give it a go.

This is one of those movies that had bad timing when it came to its release. An overworked mother and her daughter do not get along. When they switch bodies, each is forced to adapt to the others life for one freaky Friday. I thought this was cute and not bad. All of the fancy characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was good enough.

'Freaky Friday' (2003) is a remake of a Disney movie about a young, rebellious girl and her mother swapping bodies for a day. This enables them to see each other through a new set of eyes so they are able to understand their points of view better and (hopefully) respect each other a little bit more.'Freaky Friday' is actually an enjoyable escape for a couple of hours. There are plenty of laughs, and the characters are believable in their roles. There is a definite focus in the film, so it does not require much thought. It's the sort of film you can just sit back and relax with.It's been too long ago that I've seen the original, so I will not compare. I will just state that I think this was a good remake of the film. A film like this one is dated quickly because relating to the characters is a 'must'. This film is in tune with current family values and relationships and in with modern trends. Well done. 5/10.

I've been wanting to see this film since the trailers started playing many moons ago. I saw the Jody Foster version when it first came out in 1976 and like that one, the 2003 version is an excellent all ages movie. It reminds me of the great flicks Disney use to release all the time during the 60's and 70's so it was no surprise they reached to the vault to redo "Freaky Friday".Jamie Lee Curtis has her best comedy role since "A Fish Called Wanda". She was having fun with the part and many of the teen mannerisms she did as Annabell were dead on. Curtis is one of the most underrated actors in the world. Just based on her performance "Freaky Friday" was a great ride.Lindsay Lohan made the movie better with her take on Annabell. I have liked Lohan since "The Parent Trap" and if she decides to stay with acting she might go on as long as Jody Foster has in the business. Lohan has one thing that actors like Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have and that is an expressive face. Acting is so much better when the actor can add to their part through the expressions in their face and Lindsay can do that.Watching the movie was a delight for me. I never got the feeling that 35 year old men wrote the script (they didn't) like I do with some of the "teen" movies out today.The music used by the movie band "Pink Slip" was above average and the other soundtrack music fit the film as well.Now if they would just do a big budget "Herbie the Love Bug" feature, I would be even more happy.

I hadn't seen the original though knew the concept. I enjoyed the film and Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsey Lohan did good jobs of inhabiting each other's bodies. Curtis really goes to town with the gestures and mannerisms of a 16 yr old (proving perhaps we're all still 16 in our minds) and Lohan does a good impression of a mature mom whilst actually being 16. The end is highly predictable though none the worse for that.Of the supporting players Mark Harmon has little to do but look baffled at the character changes and the annoying part goes to Harold Gould as a rather pointless deaf grand-dad. The part of the teacher played by Stephen Tobolowsky could have been expanded as his dry approach was amusing.Overall a film well worth seeing. Lindsey Lohan should go far and Jamie Lee Curtis is still worth good movie parts which she seems to find hard to get these days.

Silly remake of old DIsney film has mom (Jamie Lee Curtis, having a blast) and daughter (Lindsay Lohan, who must have had "gets to sing" placed in her contract) switching places... chaos ensues.. Similar to the old late 80s body switching films.. nothing new.. has a few laughs. GRADE: C

Look . . . I'm mainly into sci-fi, fantasy, action-thriller, and special effects movies (i.e. Matrix, LOTR, Identity, Star Wars, etc.) and generally try to avoid chic flicks and warm-fuzzy feel-good movies.  After watching the current Freaky Friday starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan now I understand why.See, I'm a guy, and guys don't cry, well, that's what we've been told.  On top of that I'm 48 years old so I'd better have my maturity act together. So, what happened?  Besides laughing my butt off at the truly funny scenes (my wife and I caught a few stares from other movie-goers), I had to strain every muscle in my body to keep from bawling like a, no, it can't be true .. . girl.I might have to consult a therapist (Jamie Lee can certainly fill that role anytime) to understand why this movie had such a profound effect on my emotions.  Maybe it's because my parents never really understood me (I certainly understand them now) or maybe it's because I have a couple daughters and I've rarely tried to put myself in their shoes.  This movie accomplished that for me, big time . . . the ultimate exercise in empathy.
The interaction between mother and daughter was superbly acted and very believable especially with the switched roles.  Moreover, the supporting characters, from the little brother, to the fiancé, to the grandfather, to even the detention monitor at the school were also outstanding and made this story a real winner.I can honestly say that this is in my top 20 favorite movies of all time and I will most certainly buy the DVD when available.  I can't believe I've been saying all this about a movie way out of my usual genre but here it is, in writing.  Please watch this movie, and then tell me I'm not losing it. Enjoy!

Freaky Friday was better than I thought it would be.  I actually laughed out loud quite a few times.  The acting in this movie was VERY good.  If you think about it the actresses had to completely change thier movements and the way they held themselves and everything.  I think they did a very good job.  This movie also brought tears to my eyes (where Anna gives her speech at the end).  I also liked the way they protrayed the daughter's life, it wasn't that she didn't study, her school work was hard, and the teacher WAS out to make things hard for her!  It had a good ending and Lindsay Lohan did an excellent job with the guitar parts.

Freaky Friday (2003): Dir: Mark Waters / Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Jamie Lee Curtis, Mark Harmon, Harold Gould, Chad Michael Murray: I am not sure why the emphasis is on Friday since it is the dawn of the weekend. Promising remake faltered by cheap sets and simple plotting. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan play a mother and daughter duo whose bodies are switched due to a lame fortune cookie mishap. Curtis plays a psychiatrist who just completed a successful book. Lohan plays her rebellious daughter who plays in a band and serves detention often at school. They devour fortune cookies at a Chinese restaurant while in the midst of bickering and they switch bodies. This is totally lame in its earthquake effect. Directed by Mark Waters who had already made the embarrassing Head Over Heels. This is not much of an improvement given the fact that Curtis and Lohan actually pull off convincing portrayal, but they are trapped in a formula driven showcase that is beneath them. Mark Harmon is wasted as Curtis's fiancé, and the women at the Chinese restaurant are lame. Harold Gould makes a wasted appearance as grandpa. Chad Michael Murray plays the boyfriend whom mother disapproves of. Remake that toys with one's speech and habits while also addressing age, responsibility and parental role models. Unfortunately it is a remake that is hardly freaky on any given day. Score: 3 / 10

At first I couldn't understand why this was the version to see. It didn't seem any better than the Shelley Long/Gaby Hoffmann version I enjoyed years ago. Lindsay Lohan was a holy terror and her mom was merely uptight but nothing special. But of course all that changed when the magic spell took effect and Anna woke up horrified.There are many deserving performances, mostly dramatic, that get Oscar nominations each year. It's easier for a movie like this to get recognition when comedy has its own categories. But Jamie Lee Curtis was amazing. Such a bizarre sight, this middle-aged woman acting like a teen! Maybe Oscar would be asking too much because of the competition, but Curtis certainly deserved a Golden Globe nomination. And Lindsay Lohan did a capable job of the mom in a teen's body, trying so hard to fit in at school.Harold Gould's performance also should be noted. He made quite a likable buffoonish grandfather. I liked Rosalind Chao's clueless, almost stereotypical restaurant hostess. Lucille Soong made us notice as Chao's meddling mom who just HAD to help this family. And Jeff Marcus as one of Tess' more troubled patients.Although the musicians showed talent, I will say I agree with the first opinion Tess had of her daughter's music. It was all just noise! I liked the music for the wedding rehearsal.I still want to see the Jodie Foster original, and twice I have been annoyed that someone felt the need to do a remake rather than show the original. But this one was really worth it!

Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) can't seem to get along with her teenage daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan). Tess is a therapist getting married to Ryan (Mark Harmon). Anna's life in school isn't going that well. Stacey (Julie Gonzalo) is picking on her. School hunk Jake (Chad Michael Murray) doesn't know she exists. She keeps getting detention. Then Jake talks to her. Her band has an audition but it's her mother's wedding rehearsal. They get into a big fight at the Chinese restaurant and magic fortune cookies set them switching bodies.As a Disney teen movie, it's relatively harmless. It's better than most. Lindsay Lohan is good at playing the teen at this point and it's a good start to her high school roles. It's easier for her to play more uptight during the switch. Jamie Lee Curtis is great at being childish. She has the tougher job. The great thing is that both actresses do credible jobs both before and after the switch. The story isn't that special. It's a pretty straight forward body switch.

Ah poor Lindsay Lohan before she lost the plot,she was great in The Parent Trap,Herbie Fully Loaded,even this movie was good so here is my review on Freaky Friday.Lohan plays Anna Coleman a rebellious teenager who likes to rock it out with her mates and their band that's up for a completion,but Anna's overprotective mother Tess(played by Jamie Lee Curtis)doesn't want her to miss out on her engagement party dinner with her new fiancé(played by Mark Harmon who also starred in the 2004 movie Chasing Liberty as Mandy Moore's dad who's a president). But when Anna and Tess receive mysterious fortune cookies from a mysterious Chinese woman the two wake up the next morning in body swap reverse. So now Lindsay Lohan IS Jamie Lee Curtis and vice versa for Curtis' charcther. Now the two must figure out how to change back before Tess' big day ???Overall I found this to be a guilt pleasure of mine,its funny,charming and its a great film to watch with your mates. For what it is i'd say check it out.

Watching this in 2022, even though outdated in sense of relatability, I found myself laughing at several points of the movie. Jamie Lee Curtis playing the harder part understood her assignment and portrayed the childish role really well and Lindsey Lohan as usual advances in the teenage role, making the movie entertaining. The plot with Chad Michael Murrey is amusing, yet weird to me. Him as Jake and Lohan as Anna ending up together is pretty off-putting to say at least. Then again, this is a "teenage movie" and being an uncomplicated comedy a deep and complex plot, nor end, is necessary to fill its purpose.The reasons it does not score higher in my ratings is because the weird ending where Anna should have ditched Jake, but also its predictable where you are able to foretell each move . Nonetheless, I enjoyed watching this movie and I would definitely class this as a feel-good movie. Since the feel-good movies are my preferred kind I will probably be watching this again sometime in the future. Personally I get nostalgic watching these early Y2K movies. If you are like me I would recommend the movie, otherwise you should not have your hopes high..

This was the Lindsay Lohan version, not the Jodie Foster version which I haven't seen in about 10 years. I was in the mood for a light movie when I watched this, I also enjoyed the original movie. Furthermore I had never seen a Lindsay Lohan film so I was interested to see what all the fuss was about. The film was actually very entertaining. Lohan could have been any teen but she still held my interest. It was amusing to see Jamie Lee Curtis paying herself out ("I look like the crypt keeper"). This was pretty predictable really, they both learnt a lesson that it is hard to be a teenager/middle-aged woman and that they love each other very much. However, the journey was entertaining nonetheless. Lohan of course was in a band in the film to remind us that she is a singer too. Ah the crossover artist. Very much a throwaway film but good if you are in the mood for something of that sort. Nice family fun.

This is about the third adaptation of the Mary Rodgers novel. Finally, the team behind this film has gotten it together. It's obvious the original text has been revised in order to include the language of today. But the best thing about the movie is the casting assembled for it, with a sure director's hand behind it.Actually, this is about the first film that has made me laugh since "Bringing down the house" that came out earlier this year. Most comedies today seem to forget that the basic premise for their existence is to amuse the audiences and entertain them, at the same time.Mark Waters, the director shows he has a fine sense of how to make things move constantly in this comedy about identity changes. Of course, this film wouldn't be half the fun it is without Jamie Lee Curtis, who has never been as effective in any previous films. Her take on Tess Coleman, the not so cool therapist, strikes the right tone.Her daughter is played with a lot of conviction by Lindsay Lohan, who is totally believable as the typical teen ager working through the pain of losing a father and getting a replacement she is not too fond of.Things move at a rapid pace; there is never a dull moment in the film. It's a perfect summer comedy that will leave the viewer satisfied and happy.

Freaky Friday is a remake of a 1976 movie. That movie starred Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris, and I have to confess that I have not seen it. That said, I can tell you it's probably better than the remake, on the basis that the original almost always is. Another reason for saying that is because, well, the remake doesn't really set the bar very high. The story is a variation on an extremely common Hollywood tale - two people switch bodies and, ergo, experience each other's lives, and learn to appreciate each other, blah, blah, blah. It's an old story. And by old, I mean, well, overused. Really overused; there are many hundreds of movies that run along this premise, few of them innovative in any way. In this case, the two people are Tess Coleman (Curtis) and her teenaged daughter Anna (Lohan). You can probably guess for yourself what happens; the boy Anna likes comes after her in her mother's body, so he likes her mind, Tess in her daughter's body goes some way to straightening out Anna's life (which doesn't really need it) and so forth. I'd like to tell you more, but it's time for another confession. To be honest, I just wasn't paying attention. Freaky Friday is just so middle-of-the-road and average, not to mention predictable, that I found I didn';t really need to watch it; I felt I'd seen it simply through the banality of the story. Not that the movie doesn't have its good points. Curtis is fun as the teenager in a middle-aged body (incidentally, I have it on good authority Jamie Lee Curtis is over fifty. When does she intend to start looking like it?), and Lohan is reasonably good as the mother inside the daughter, but neither is spectacular. There are a few decent laughs, which I suppose is all you can ask for, as well. The only bit worth writing home about is the soundtrack; modern punk/rock covers of old Turtles songs, for example. The daughter character is a rock musician as well, so there's some rocking out involved, although to say more blows what little about the plot you haven't already anticipated. Aside from the music, Freaky Friday has little to recommend it. It's so hideously average and mundane it doesn't deserve more than a completely average rating, with half a point added for a good soundtrack. That, at least, is something. Good-o-meter rating: 6/10

When I first saw the title of this film, I thought it was a scary movie that I didn't like but my friend told me it was really cool. After watching it once, it became one of my favorite movies. I really enjoyed it.This is a story about a mom and her daughter who don't get along well. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis worked together. Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is an overworked mom and Anna Coleman (Lindsay Lohan) is a typical teenager who has some problems at school and has daily fights with her younger brother. When they switch bodies, each is forced to adapt to the other's life for one day. They think each other's job is much easier than their own but they get to know that it's not so easy. Later Tess and Anna are getting to learn to understand and respect each other. Then they switch again and have a happy ending.Their acting was so real and their expressions were so creative. Lohan acted well like a real working mom and Curtis acted just like a young kid. You have to see her act. I burst into laughter many times because her acting was so funny. Curtis is a great comedian. Moreover, the supporting characters, Anna's little brother, her grandfather, her boyfriend and Tess's fiancé, were so natural and so real.Also I like songs from this movie. It has some oldies but goodies such as 'Happy Together', 'Take Me Away', 'What a Wonderful World' and Lindsay's own song 'Ultimate'. These songs were well-suited to this pleasant movie. 'Ultimate' became very popular because people liked this movie and the song.Freaky Friday is not only funny but also quite touching. So far, I've seen it hundreds of times and I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it. Everyone who likes a really funny but touching movie has to watch this film.

I admit, I was dragged to this movie by my 12-year-old cousin. At first I thought, "Lindsay Lohan? Who's that? And Jamie Lee Curtis? Isn't that the 'scream queen'?" I didn't want to go, but that was that.
Within the first few minutes of the movie, I rolled my eyes. I thought it was just a cliche movie about a mom and a daughter that fight a lot. I was bored. But ten minutes later, the magic began. I found my eyes glued to the massive screen, I found myself "shushing" anyone that interrupted my connection with the two stars. I was hooked, and that was that.
Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis work wonders together. They have wonderful chemistry on screen that make you believe that they have, in fact, switched bodies. Both actresses were brilliant in their roles of switch reversal. Their acting was so real, their expressions so priceless. Awesome, too, was the movie's supporting cast. Enough said. The script was amazingly well written, the directing extraordinary.To sum it up, this movie was "freakishly good." Pure magic, I tell you.

The scenario is a true actor's challenge. They have to convincingly play the other character within themselves, so the film rests on their performances. And they definitely do live up to it! It leads to all sorts of comedic moments, character development and understanding. The whole thing with the magical fortune cookie was a bit dumb though.

Someone wrote.... "THE BEST FILM SO FAR THIS YEAR!" Tell me you are joking...Someone else wrote "Academy Award"...Someone please stop the madness...  A remake of a remake of a remake and JLC deserves an Oscar... Whatever !!!!I can not believe I actually paid money to go see this movie.  Disney should have paid me to tell you about this movie and warn you not to spend your hard earned cash....A few laughs a few sighs but best movie of the year it is not....PLEASE STOP....Nice for the kids and that is about it...

Fun and harmless remake of the popular 1977 Disney film of the same name.Jamie and Lindsay star as a mother and teenage daughter, who don't exactly see eye to eye. They constantly argue and don't understand each others livelihoods and problems in any way shape or form. That is of course until they are magically transferred into each others bodies for a day with genuinely funny consequences.Despite the over familiarity of this type of subject, it is handed with real skill and does more than enough to have you chuckling throughout and basically watching the stars make fools of themselves! Lindsay Lohan is great, but the real star of the show is Jamie Lee Curtis in her best performance for years, she clearly enjoys herself in her role as mother (and daughter!!).

I enjoyed this film, and I do slightly prefer it to the Jodie Foster version. True, the first 15 minutes were a bit slow, and some of the script was a bit weak, not to mention the rather predictable storyline. But you know what, the performances of Lindsey Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis more than compensated, their performances were really entertaining, and I felt the chemistry between them. I loved the soundtrack, and I thought it was very sensible updating the story, so that it would appeal more to someone like my 13 year old sister, who really enjoyed it. The script, while contrived in some places, was on the whole, very funny, and anyone who's seen the 1976 film, will get a more of the same film, except updated. What I did like, is that Lohan's character is a representation of all of us, someone who doesn't do mornings, doesn't always get on with her mum, and has friends and enemies. In the 1976 version, Jodie Foster's interpretation was more sensible than Lohan's, who put a bit of her other films in, which is quite appealing for this sort of film. Overall, an enjoyable film, with a 7/10. Bethany Cox

Freaky Friday is an underrated Disney flick with a surprisingly sharp script and plenty of great laugh-out-loud moments. It's a good time.

To make Freaky Friday work perfectly; you would have to believe that Jamie Lee Curtis is Lindsay Lohan and Lindsay Lohan is Jamie Lee Curtis. Although at times it seemed that way, at other times, it just seemed like Lohan was trying to be Curtis and Curtis was trying to be Lohan. Any way you look at it, Freaky Friday is a family-friendly film that tries to please everyone, and does. It pleases shallow teen prep girls because of Chad Michael Murray. It pleases teen boys because of Lindsay Lohan. It pleases older men because of a Jamie Lee Curtis thong shot. It pleases older women because of Mark Harmon. It pleases the whole family, being that they already saw Finding Nemo and it's the only other family movie out there.Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) (changed from Ellen Andrews from the novel by Mary Rodgers) is a harried psychiatrist who still has time for her family. Anna Colemen (Lohan) (changed from Annabel Andrews) is supposed to be a typical teenager (but is anything but), and has daily fights with her younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini) (changed from Ben Andrews). Tess is going to marry Ryan (Harmon), because her husband died three years ago (can't there be a Disney movie with both parents still alive?), of whom Anna doesn't approve. After a fueled feud, Tess and Anna open fortune cookies that switch bodies: Tess is in Anna's body, and vice versa. Whatever will be done?Although most people have praised Curtis for her accurate portrayal of a typical teen (although with the people at my school, what she does is anything but typical), and she should be, Lohan does better at being an adult. If Lohan, a teenager, could be an adult so well, that's rather scary. I thought at most times Lohan was Tess, but Curtis was having too much fun as Anna to really be thought of as great. Instead of acting like Lohan, Curtis just acts like a young kid who just ate too much ice cream.One part of Freaky Friday that I didn't like is how often we were put in an awkward situation. And when they were there, they just didn't seem plausible. All of a sudden, Anna-as-Tess is a guest on a talk show, talks to someone she has a crush on, and watches Tess-as-Anna perform? Not only were they awkward, they were just not believable. On the other hand, Freaky Friday not only has some genuinely funny moments, but is also quite touching at times. Obviously, it was going to be, and Tess and Anna were going to learn to respect each other, considering it was shown in the trailer.One other part I didn't like was how far it strayed from the book. It only focused on Anna-as-Tess (Annabel-as-Ellen), and how she spent her day. Of course, back then she was a housewife, but now she has to be a successful doctor. I do admire it for changing it, unlike others, which is basically watching the book. Overall, Freaky Friday is a likable, pleasant 90-minute diverter. It won't change your life, but you won't be upset you saw it.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some language.

Freaky Friday has just the right touch. In making an identity-switch movie, there is always the temptation to overdo things, in both the comedy and the pathos sides. Jamie Lee Curtis has just about the right balance portraying a 15-year-old in a 40-year-old body. On the comedy side, although on occasions coming across as just a little bit too silly, Curtis has on the whole brought out the funny side of the situation without undue exaggeration. The important thing is her success in making the whole thing believable. On the pathos side, her toasting speech in the engagement ceremony is touching performance. Lindsay Logan, on the other hand, has much less opportunity of repeating her brilliant performance in The Parent Trap (1998). The fault is not hers. It's just that it's much less fun watching a 40-year-old in a 15-year-old body than the other way around. While this is obviously the ladies' show, the two beaus provide reliable support. However, it is the fantastic pair of grandpa (Harold Gould) and little brother (Ryan Malgarini) who stole the show, particularly the little guy. I for one would love to see a sequel with this pair swapping bodies. Good flick; well worth the admission price.

Really good watch, will watch again, and can recommend.I'm not sure what it is about this movie, but it's just an easy, fun watch. Jamie Lee Curtis is a seasoned actress, and Lindsey Lohan had finally built enough experience to be reliable in this role where she's basically doing an impression of Jamie Lee Curtis being her mom. I'm not a huge fan of either one, but I'm not going to deny their acting "chops" and they bring it here, giving the audience a natural and fun atmosphere to the dilemma.There are several very good improvements on original movie in this: cutting a lot of the thought narrative, adding a medium for the swap magic, having them wake up different instead of insta-switching, and several of the added plot lines really help fill out the world better. A career woman is more interesting to follow than a housewife (not that it's necessarily more important), the romance line(s) in this are surprising and slightly less creepy, and swapping a sports game out for musical show not only allowed for the cross competition between character events, but also allows for some great alt rock music throughout the movie: I'll admit to enjoying a movie more when I can relate to the music better.There are several good supporting actors (big and small), to include the Chinese restaurant family which, I think is a very nice cherry on top of the story. By having the source of the magic be an outside party, I think it helps the complexity of the story without causing confusion.It's a fun watch, give it a go.

This is one of those movies that had bad timing when it came to its release. An overworked mother and her daughter do not get along. When they switch bodies, each is forced to adapt to the others life for one freaky Friday. I thought this was cute and not bad. All of the fancy characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was good enough.

'Freaky Friday' (2003) is a remake of a Disney movie about a young, rebellious girl and her mother swapping bodies for a day. This enables them to see each other through a new set of eyes so they are able to understand their points of view better and (hopefully) respect each other a little bit more.'Freaky Friday' is actually an enjoyable escape for a couple of hours. There are plenty of laughs, and the characters are believable in their roles. There is a definite focus in the film, so it does not require much thought. It's the sort of film you can just sit back and relax with.It's been too long ago that I've seen the original, so I will not compare. I will just state that I think this was a good remake of the film. A film like this one is dated quickly because relating to the characters is a 'must'. This film is in tune with current family values and relationships and in with modern trends. Well done. 5/10.

I've been wanting to see this film since the trailers started playing many moons ago. I saw the Jody Foster version when it first came out in 1976 and like that one, the 2003 version is an excellent all ages movie. It reminds me of the great flicks Disney use to release all the time during the 60's and 70's so it was no surprise they reached to the vault to redo "Freaky Friday".Jamie Lee Curtis has her best comedy role since "A Fish Called Wanda". She was having fun with the part and many of the teen mannerisms she did as Annabell were dead on. Curtis is one of the most underrated actors in the world. Just based on her performance "Freaky Friday" was a great ride.Lindsay Lohan made the movie better with her take on Annabell. I have liked Lohan since "The Parent Trap" and if she decides to stay with acting she might go on as long as Jody Foster has in the business. Lohan has one thing that actors like Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts have and that is an expressive face. Acting is so much better when the actor can add to their part through the expressions in their face and Lindsay can do that.Watching the movie was a delight for me. I never got the feeling that 35 year old men wrote the script (they didn't) like I do with some of the "teen" movies out today.The music used by the movie band "Pink Slip" was above average and the other soundtrack music fit the film as well.Now if they would just do a big budget "Herbie the Love Bug" feature, I would be even more happy.

I hadn't seen the original though knew the concept. I enjoyed the film and Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsey Lohan did good jobs of inhabiting each other's bodies. Curtis really goes to town with the gestures and mannerisms of a 16 yr old (proving perhaps we're all still 16 in our minds) and Lohan does a good impression of a mature mom whilst actually being 16. The end is highly predictable though none the worse for that.Of the supporting players Mark Harmon has little to do but look baffled at the character changes and the annoying part goes to Harold Gould as a rather pointless deaf grand-dad. The part of the teacher played by Stephen Tobolowsky could have been expanded as his dry approach was amusing.Overall a film well worth seeing. Lindsey Lohan should go far and Jamie Lee Curtis is still worth good movie parts which she seems to find hard to get these days.

Silly remake of old DIsney film has mom (Jamie Lee Curtis, having a blast) and daughter (Lindsay Lohan, who must have had "gets to sing" placed in her contract) switching places... chaos ensues.. Similar to the old late 80s body switching films.. nothing new.. has a few laughs. GRADE: C

Look . . . I'm mainly into sci-fi, fantasy, action-thriller, and special effects movies (i.e. Matrix, LOTR, Identity, Star Wars, etc.) and generally try to avoid chic flicks and warm-fuzzy feel-good movies.  After watching the current Freaky Friday starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan now I understand why.See, I'm a guy, and guys don't cry, well, that's what we've been told.  On top of that I'm 48 years old so I'd better have my maturity act together. So, what happened?  Besides laughing my butt off at the truly funny scenes (my wife and I caught a few stares from other movie-goers), I had to strain every muscle in my body to keep from bawling like a, no, it can't be true .. . girl.I might have to consult a therapist (Jamie Lee can certainly fill that role anytime) to understand why this movie had such a profound effect on my emotions.  Maybe it's because my parents never really understood me (I certainly understand them now) or maybe it's because I have a couple daughters and I've rarely tried to put myself in their shoes.  This movie accomplished that for me, big time . . . the ultimate exercise in empathy.
The interaction between mother and daughter was superbly acted and very believable especially with the switched roles.  Moreover, the supporting characters, from the little brother, to the fiancé, to the grandfather, to even the detention monitor at the school were also outstanding and made this story a real winner.I can honestly say that this is in my top 20 favorite movies of all time and I will most certainly buy the DVD when available.  I can't believe I've been saying all this about a movie way out of my usual genre but here it is, in writing.  Please watch this movie, and then tell me I'm not losing it. Enjoy!

Freaky Friday was better than I thought it would be.  I actually laughed out loud quite a few times.  The acting in this movie was VERY good.  If you think about it the actresses had to completely change thier movements and the way they held themselves and everything.  I think they did a very good job.  This movie also brought tears to my eyes (where Anna gives her speech at the end).  I also liked the way they protrayed the daughter's life, it wasn't that she didn't study, her school work was hard, and the teacher WAS out to make things hard for her!  It had a good ending and Lindsay Lohan did an excellent job with the guitar parts.

Freaky Friday (2003): Dir: Mark Waters / Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Jamie Lee Curtis, Mark Harmon, Harold Gould, Chad Michael Murray: I am not sure why the emphasis is on Friday since it is the dawn of the weekend. Promising remake faltered by cheap sets and simple plotting. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan play a mother and daughter duo whose bodies are switched due to a lame fortune cookie mishap. Curtis plays a psychiatrist who just completed a successful book. Lohan plays her rebellious daughter who plays in a band and serves detention often at school. They devour fortune cookies at a Chinese restaurant while in the midst of bickering and they switch bodies. This is totally lame in its earthquake effect. Directed by Mark Waters who had already made the embarrassing Head Over Heels. This is not much of an improvement given the fact that Curtis and Lohan actually pull off convincing portrayal, but they are trapped in a formula driven showcase that is beneath them. Mark Harmon is wasted as Curtis's fiancé, and the women at the Chinese restaurant are lame. Harold Gould makes a wasted appearance as grandpa. Chad Michael Murray plays the boyfriend whom mother disapproves of. Remake that toys with one's speech and habits while also addressing age, responsibility and parental role models. Unfortunately it is a remake that is hardly freaky on any given day. Score: 3 / 10

At first I couldn't understand why this was the version to see. It didn't seem any better than the Shelley Long/Gaby Hoffmann version I enjoyed years ago. Lindsay Lohan was a holy terror and her mom was merely uptight but nothing special. But of course all that changed when the magic spell took effect and Anna woke up horrified.There are many deserving performances, mostly dramatic, that get Oscar nominations each year. It's easier for a movie like this to get recognition when comedy has its own categories. But Jamie Lee Curtis was amazing. Such a bizarre sight, this middle-aged woman acting like a teen! Maybe Oscar would be asking too much because of the competition, but Curtis certainly deserved a Golden Globe nomination. And Lindsay Lohan did a capable job of the mom in a teen's body, trying so hard to fit in at school.Harold Gould's performance also should be noted. He made quite a likable buffoonish grandfather. I liked Rosalind Chao's clueless, almost stereotypical restaurant hostess. Lucille Soong made us notice as Chao's meddling mom who just HAD to help this family. And Jeff Marcus as one of Tess' more troubled patients.Although the musicians showed talent, I will say I agree with the first opinion Tess had of her daughter's music. It was all just noise! I liked the music for the wedding rehearsal.I still want to see the Jodie Foster original, and twice I have been annoyed that someone felt the need to do a remake rather than show the original. But this one was really worth it!

As overall, Freaky Friday is a good film but not perfect. First of all there is some bugs. One of them is that, In the first morning after the "personal change", Anna(actually is mom) wearing some "old" clothes. But when the step father brings she to the school we saw that Anna's clothes aren't the clothes which she wore at home. The relation between Harry and grandpa is very funny and adds joy to the movie. Harry's grandpa imitation "earthquake.. earthquake wow" quote is certainly bringing the house down. Watch this movie if you want some fun. Lindsay Lohan is great at all. Jamie Lee Curtis shows her quality as an actress.

Widowed therapist Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her aspiring alt-rock grunge musician daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) don't always see eye to eye with Tess juggling her job and multiple household duties as well as a fast approaching wedding to her fiancé Ryan (Mark Harmon), while Anna faces pressures from school and frequent fights with her obnoxious younger brother Harry (Ryan Malgarini). Following a heated argument between the two at a Chinese restaurant over Anna's conflicting band audition with Tess' rehearsal dinner, the owner's mother (Lucille Soong) gives the two magic fortune cookies. The next morning Tess awakens in Anna's body and Anna in Tess'.Freaky Friday is a remake of the 1976 Disney comedy of the same name based on the book of the same name by Mary Rodgers. This 2003 entry marks Disney's second time remaking the film as a TV movie remake from 1995 starring Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann was previously produced. The film became a sleeper hit earning $160 million against its $26 million budget and was also praised for the performances and chemistry between Curtis and Lohan. While Freaky Friday is playing with very familiar material, it just goes to show that good execution can overcome a familiar premise and in some cases elevate it above its predecessors.While I appreciated the original Freaky Friday for the performances by Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris, I was less impressed by the screenplay that had things like the waterskiing climax, the very broad approach to humor including a lengthy cartoonish car chase, and the fact that Harris and Foster were kept separated for the entirety of the body switch so they couldn't play against each other for comic friction. This 2003 version is given a slightly more grounded take on the material as director Mark Waters who'd go on to direct Mean Girls gives the gags a lot of punch and doesn't linger on sequences too long and keeps everything moving forward. In many ways you can see Freaky Friday 2003 as something of a dry run to Mean Girls as there's similar approaches to high school satire with the targets in Freaky Friday being pretty on point especially for a Disney film. The movie also wisely gives us a brief setup by playing through an ordinary day in Tess and Anna's life so we have a contrasting point for the body swap shenanigans later in the story, and this is another massive improvement from the '76 version. The movie also has more weighty stakes as the waterskiing climax has been ditched in favor of a combination of Anna's band audition and the wedding rehearsal dinner and the plot involving Tess' fiancé Mark is very sweet and legitimately engaging on an emotional and thematic level.Freaky Friday gives a fresh coat of paint to old material and makes its own identity while respecting the original core of the film. The 2003 film improves on the '76 original with the pacing, comedic punch, and emotional weight given more gravitas and the end result is very impressive.

The scenario is a true actor's challenge. They have to convincingly play the other character within themselves, so the film rests on their performances. And they definitely do live up to it! It leads to all sorts of comedic moments, character development and understanding. The whole thing with the magical fortune cookie was a bit dumb though.

This was the Lindsay Lohan version, not the Jodie Foster version which I haven't seen in about 10 years. I was in the mood for a light movie when I watched this, I also enjoyed the original movie. Furthermore I had never seen a Lindsay Lohan film so I was interested to see what all the fuss was about. The film was actually very entertaining. Lohan could have been any teen but she still held my interest. It was amusing to see Jamie Lee Curtis paying herself out ("I look like the crypt keeper"). This was pretty predictable really, they both learnt a lesson that it is hard to be a teenager/middle-aged woman and that they love each other very much. However, the journey was entertaining nonetheless. Lohan of course was in a band in the film to remind us that she is a singer too. Ah the crossover artist. Very much a throwaway film but good if you are in the mood for something of that sort. Nice family fun.

This is about the third adaptation of the Mary Rodgers novel. Finally, the team behind this film has gotten it together. It's obvious the original text has been revised in order to include the language of today. But the best thing about the movie is the casting assembled for it, with a sure director's hand behind it.Actually, this is about the first film that has made me laugh since "Bringing down the house" that came out earlier this year. Most comedies today seem to forget that the basic premise for their existence is to amuse the audiences and entertain them, at the same time.Mark Waters, the director shows he has a fine sense of how to make things move constantly in this comedy about identity changes. Of course, this film wouldn't be half the fun it is without Jamie Lee Curtis, who has never been as effective in any previous films. Her take on Tess Coleman, the not so cool therapist, strikes the right tone.Her daughter is played with a lot of conviction by Lindsay Lohan, who is totally believable as the typical teen ager working through the pain of losing a father and getting a replacement she is not too fond of.Things move at a rapid pace; there is never a dull moment in the film. It's a perfect summer comedy that will leave the viewer satisfied and happy.

"Family Fun" doesn't need to be completely innocuous or empty-headed, and this comedy is a well-crafted, easy-going, energetic time-bending teen fantasy--that will also appeal to parents, as both generations get in their licks when mother and daughter change identities for an inch of time--long enough for either to learn some worthwhile lessons.Freaky Friday is not a stupid film, nor is it cutting-edge--Curtis and Lohan are obviously having a delightful time, and if you're not looking for consciousness-raising of any significance, you will too! It's pleasant to watch a pro at work with a talented younger performer, and with luck, perhaps Lohan will someday achieve the promise as an adult she shows in this delightful romp.

When I first saw the title of this film, I thought it was a scary movie that I didn't like but my friend told me it was really cool. After watching it once, it became one of my favorite movies. I really enjoyed it.This is a story about a mom and her daughter who don't get along well. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis worked together. Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) is an overworked mom and Anna Coleman (Lindsay Lohan) is a typical teenager who has some problems at school and has daily fights with her younger brother. When they switch bodies, each is forced to adapt to the other's life for one day. They think each other's job is much easier than their own but they get to know that it's not so easy. Later Tess and Anna are getting to learn to understand and respect each other. Then they switch again and have a happy ending.Their acting was so real and their expressions were so creative. Lohan acted well like a real working mom and Curtis acted just like a young kid. You have to see her act. I burst into laughter many times because her acting was so funny. Curtis is a great comedian. Moreover, the supporting characters, Anna's little brother, her grandfather, her boyfriend and Tess's fiancé, were so natural and so real.Also I like songs from this movie. It has some oldies but goodies such as 'Happy Together', 'Take Me Away', 'What a Wonderful World' and Lindsay's own song 'Ultimate'. These songs were well-suited to this pleasant movie. 'Ultimate' became very popular because people liked this movie and the song.Freaky Friday is not only funny but also quite touching. So far, I've seen it hundreds of times and I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it. Everyone who likes a really funny but touching movie has to watch this film.

I admit, I was dragged to this movie by my 12-year-old cousin. At first I thought, "Lindsay Lohan? Who's that? And Jamie Lee Curtis? Isn't that the 'scream queen'?" I didn't want to go, but that was that.
Within the first few minutes of the movie, I rolled my eyes. I thought it was just a cliche movie about a mom and a daughter that fight a lot. I was bored. But ten minutes later, the magic began. I found my eyes glued to the massive screen, I found myself "shushing" anyone that interrupted my connection with the two stars. I was hooked, and that was that.
Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis work wonders together. They have wonderful chemistry on screen that make you believe that they have, in fact, switched bodies. Both actresses were brilliant in their roles of switch reversal. Their acting was so real, their expressions so priceless. Awesome, too, was the movie's supporting cast. Enough said. The script was amazingly well written, the directing extraordinary.To sum it up, this movie was "freakishly good." Pure magic, I tell you.

Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) can't seem to get along with her teenage daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan). Tess is a therapist getting married to Ryan (Mark Harmon). Anna's life in school isn't going that well. Stacey (Julie Gonzalo) is picking on her. School hunk Jake (Chad Michael Murray) doesn't know she exists. She keeps getting detention. Then Jake talks to her. Her band has an audition but it's her mother's wedding rehearsal. They get into a big fight at the Chinese restaurant and magic fortune cookies set them switching bodies.As a Disney teen movie, it's relatively harmless. It's better than most. Lindsay Lohan is good at playing the teen at this point and it's a good start to her high school roles. It's easier for her to play more uptight during the switch. Jamie Lee Curtis is great at being childish. She has the tougher job. The great thing is that both actresses do credible jobs both before and after the switch. The story isn't that special. It's a pretty straight forward body switch.

Someone wrote.... "THE BEST FILM SO FAR THIS YEAR!" Tell me you are joking...Someone else wrote "Academy Award"...Someone please stop the madness...  A remake of a remake of a remake and JLC deserves an Oscar... Whatever !!!!I can not believe I actually paid money to go see this movie.  Disney should have paid me to tell you about this movie and warn you not to spend your hard earned cash....A few laughs a few sighs but best movie of the year it is not....PLEASE STOP....Nice for the kids and that is about it...
