BOAT TRIP is the kind of movie that has a good premise but remains under developed . A couple of horny young men sign up for a sex cruise but since they've annoyed the travel agent he gets his revenge by putting them on a gay cruise . Be honest there's all types of laugh out loud opportunities with this kind of plot but for some unknown reason laughs are few and far between No I take that back because the reason isn't unknown at all and is very obvious - There's a lack of credibility involved . The two protagonists Jerry and Nick are told by the travel agent that there's three girls for every boy , a ratio that would make The Beach Boys envious . So they go down to the harbour along with a bunch of well toned young men , walk around the cruise ship brag to each other what they're gonna be doing to all those hot chicks , visit the bar which is full of hunky young men who are not wearing much and only realise it's a gay cruise when Lloyd Faversham tells them . Considering Jerry and Nick were expecting a ship to have a 75% population of women it's impossible to believe they wouldn't have noticed something was up ( No jokes please )as soon as they set foot upon the ship . I know it's only a film but even so there's a distinct lack of credibility involved The gags themselves are unfunny and predictable and as soon as Nick asks : " Do you know where I can get off ? " you know that the punchline is going to be " yes try The Hole In One " . I couldn't help thinking that much of the potential humour was toned down because the producers didn't want to be accused of homophobia so we've got an entirely daft movie that both gay and straight people will dislike . Mind you no doubt the cast and production team enjoyed working on the movie . They spend several weeks filming on a cruise ship in the Med and they get paid for it ! Some people have all the luck unlike the audience for BOAT TRIP

Boat Trip isn't a bad idea for a movie, 2 straight guys go on a cruise looking for love, only to find that its a gay cruise and all their fellow cruisers are men. Potentially this is a scenario that should have made us laugh ourselves silly; well i'm sorry to say that it doesn't, you may raise the occasional smile and if your lucky you may even titter once or twice, but that's your lot.Boat trip is average in every department and Cuba Gooding Jnr. should stick to making movies like Men of Honour and Instinct; he is simply better at playing this type of character.It's not a total waste of time, but it's certainly a disappointment 5/10

This film is not perfect, but I really enjoyed watching it. Sure; it is offensive, crude, weak, etc in places, and that drags it down in the final analysis, but buried amongst the crap was a good idea and some really funny one liners and situations.Obviously, if you voted for Pat Buchanan you won't like it (for maybe precisely the same reasons Horatio Sanz's character freaked out at first - too scared to look inside and at least consider that you might be gay (like all true reactionaries BTW)), but Boat Trip reminded me a lot of Saving Silverman, another funny ass film that got unfairly savaged. Consider the cast - any excuse to get Horatio Sanz, Cuba Gooding (an underrated comic actor - see Rat Race), Artie from Howard Stern, Will Farrell, Lin Shaye and the fat dude from Herman's Head together to curse and be lewd and crude HAS to be worth at least a couple stars...(and don't forget Roger Moore preceding David Suchet in the remake of The Inlaws as serious-British-actor-doing-a-great-job-at-playing-a-flamer) The Afternoon Specialish attempts at overcoming prejudice and looking within yourself blah blah blah were ham handed and corny, but hey - most gay bashers don't understand complex thought and seeing a big fat funny regular guy literally scratch his head and say "gosh, I always thought I HAD to hate gays...." before learning how to live and let live might actually have convinced someone out in Montana or Nebraska that they DON'T need to beat the tar out of some nelly guy to figure that out for themselves and who knows - it might have saved some innocent guy from being the next Matthew Shepard? So in that context, was sitting through a partially bad movie and laughing your ass off at a couple of dick and sperm jokes really that much of a price to pay? I didn't think so.

Well, I thought this movie was pretty funny. Two straight guys on a gay cruise. Which they don't know when they board. It's not exactly a masterpiece of a comedy. Cuba Gooding does what does best, plays around acting like an idiot. But in this scenery it works, he is kind of girly. Just don't expect to much of it, and it's quite enjoyable. When I went to see it didn't have any expectations, and ended of feeling good about myself (im not gay by the way, although it might sound like it). The swedish swimsuit team was a bit much though. It might have been funnier if they actually spoken swedish. But to summarize, it's a good movie to rent with your buddies!

Two straight guys end up on a gay cruise. I really, really wonder how anyone could have thought that this simple idea would make for a good and funny movie, but unfortunately a lot of people thought so and there we are.I mean, in my opinion the worst kind of movies are bad comedies. I can live with bad action movies or bad horror movies or even bad dramas. But watching a really bad comedy is like getting beaten up. Other bad movies at least can make you laugh (sometimes) but if a comedy is really bad there's nothing left to enjoy.I can honestly say that "Boat Trip" is one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. The story itself is awful and even worse, unbelievably predictable. There isn't a joke you don't see coming miles before it happens and it's always one you really wish won't happen, because it is such a bad one. But every joke here hits its bad mark and leaves you with nothing more to do than to stare at the screen in disbelief.The whole "gay" issue is handled as bad as possible. There is not a single "normal" gay person on this ship. Everyone is a kind of a freak, dresses like a woman, makes exaggerated moves and is saying "uh" and "oh" and "ohoho" and "ohlala" and things like that all the time. Every clich√© you can imagine about a gay man is implanted here and beaten so long until it's last drop of life vanishes. And it's all about sex. Everyone is kissing and touching and making sexual advances at everyone else. At the breakfast buffet there is an ice sculpture that looks like a bunch of penises. That's supposed to be funny. When one character makes a change of mind from hating gays to being gay it is so unconvincing that 1 minute later he is running after one of the babes. When he asks a store clerk if they got any condoms, a dozen gay men hand him some condoms, because, you know, gay people need them, ho ho. The other guy has to act as if he's gay so he can sleep with the girl he loves (don't ask about the logic). When they do so under an orange tree, oranges fall down, so that afterward they are covered in about 100 oranges. He also does a dance show as a drag queen for about 3 minutes. Everyone is shocked or disgusted about being gay, no matter if it's a man or a woman. Imagine that: this movie is about gays and it isn't even sure what to think of them. When one guy starts philosophizing that gay people may not be so bad after all you're almost ready to believe him. This movie is as sexist, homophobic and horny as a movie can be.The characters are unbelievable cut-out stereotypes played by untalented actors with no conviction at all. Yes, there is Cuba Gooding Jr. who, let's face it, is not a talented person and hasn't done a good film since "Jerry Maguire" and "As Good As It Gets". His fat, stupid partner is one of the worst actors in this movie. Victoria Silvstedt plays one of the super babes by showing as much as she can without undressing. Roger Moore wanders through the movie as a kind of preacher who wants everyone to become gay and says one line that is unforgettable. Before parachuting out of a plane he really says: "I was in the service for her majesty once." That hurts. There is Vivica A. Fox on auto-pilot, Bob Gunton in a 5-second bit (nevertheless credited in the opening credits), Richard Roundtree in a 10-second-bit (dito) and Lin Shaye as the babes' trainer and at the same time as the most painful-to-watch person in this film. Roselyn Sanchez as the love interest-girl is the only one who doesn't make you cringe every time you see her. But maybe that's just her looks and who cares anyway?There is nothing good in this movie, nothing at all. The music is stupid (with references to "West Side Story", of course), the gay men wear colorful dresses, women's clothes or leather suits, the women wear bikinis or see-through dresses and even the extras are unconvincing. Uneccessary to ask how two loser guys can pay for such a luxury trip. Or why Roselyn can jump into a pool and dry in 2 seconds afterward. Or why she says she likes being on a ship with gay men because then she doesn't have to care about her make-up or her clothes when, while saying that, she wears a lot of make-up and very sexy clothes.Two scenes of unbelievable stupidity are worth mentioning. In one the fat guy somehow has sex with the babes' trainer instead with one of the babes. How this worked I don't know, since the room is obviously lit, so that you see exactly who's lying in the bed, but he nevertheless crawls between her legs, which leads to the two fighting across the room, while the trainer gets orgasmic when being shot through the room with a fire extinguisher.The other, absolutely worst scene, shows Roselyn Sanchez showing Cuba Gooding Jr. how she satisfies a man orally and she does it with a banana for about 2 minutes. The scene ends with Cuba Gooding Jr. ejaculating out of the window on the face of one half of a gay couple. This scene was one of the most painful scenes I ever had to watch in a cinema and the temptation to walk out has never been bigger.This movie is simply dead in the water in every way. Avoid it at all costs, please. Let the makers know what they did to the world by making this movie. Have mercy with yourself.

I went to this movie after four days of being snowed in thinking it would be a fun comedy after developing cabin fever.  Boy, was I mistaken.  This movie was embarrassingly bad!  Not only was it not funny at all, it set the notion of positive gay images back 30 years.  Every character was a stereotype, which can be okay in some situations (i.e. The Birdcage, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, Queer As FolK, etc.) but, there were no redeeming characters at all!  I really wanted to walk out but kept thinking it had to get better than this.  But, alas it never did.  So, save your money and avoid this piece of garbage. I know I should have stayed home.

Were this movie released today, it would be the subject of a lot of ire. After botching his proposal, Cuba's character ends up suddenly single and depressed. After this goes on for some time, his friend convinces him to go on a singles cruise. After angering the travel agent that books their trip, they end up on a gay cruise. This is where the straight, gorgeous dance teacher comes in and instantly catches the main character's interest. There are a lot of anti-gay jokes here, but nothing hateful is said. I guess your level of ire depends on how sensitive a person you are. Funny movie, however probably a low point in Cuba's career.

Review contains risqu√© spoiler, if you are easily offended do not read.Every critic and reviewer in the world seemed to hate this movie, but I have to disagree with them.  The movie is about two straight men that get put on a gay cruise ship.  Critics seem to be pointing out that the gay men are portrayed as just a bunch of freaky stereotypes.   I remember the poker players were very normal, and Roger Moore played a dignified man.  In my opinion, the gay men were not portrayed in a bad light.  Yes there were some stereotypes, but don't forget this is a comedy not a drama.  It would be pretty boring if everyone played a straight bland character.  All the characters are cartoonish in this movie.  Even Horatio Sanz plays a stereotype, fat stupid guy.  Critics make it seem like the gays are portrayed as a bunch of depraved perverts.  I just think that they are looking for a good time; it would be no different then a comedy movie about a party cruise filled with heterosexuals.  The heterosexuals would want to party and try to score, so I do not understand why it would be offensive to see gay men do the same.If you need a reason to see this movie, see it because of the banana scene. Roselyn Sanchez plays the cruise ship dance teacher that Cuba Gooding courts throughout the movie.  She has one of the sexiest scenes in any R rated movie, I have ever seen.  She shows Cuba how she can play with a banana. She shows how she licks, and nibbles and kisses the lucky banana.  It excites Cuba so much he has to run to the bathroom.  I am surprised this scene did not cause a NC 17 rating.  It was very risqu√©.
Yes, this is just a dumb movie, but sometimes dumb schlock movies can be a form of escapism. I will remember this movie as having a very special banana, James Bond, and sunbathing. 7/10, but then again I am the drunken_critic.

This isn't a must-see, nor is it a should-see, but it's not bad for a film this amateurish and low-brow.  Despite having watched a couple billion movies, I've never become an expert at pointing out things like continuity errors and other flubs of that sort, but you don't have to be a film scholar to notice the COUNTLESS times the boom mike appears in the shots.  I've seen student films shot with more professionalism.  Come on!The script is written with almost no intelligence.  Any perv with half a brain can cough up such a cheap set of gags like this.  But the sense of humor don't lie.  I did get a fair deal of laughs.  Not only that, but I was impressed by the gratuitous shots of half-naked women!  Viewers probably assume since it's a film about a gay cruise, there'd be nothing but half-naked guys, but think again!  I'm glad the director was thinking about the straight guys in the audience.Part of the film's charm is it reminds me of those late night adult comedies like "Bikini Carwash Company" and "Beauty School."  Lots of women in bikinis and nothing but tasteless sex gags.  You can probably see most of the punchlines from a mile away, yet you still want to laugh.  There's one scene where Cuba Gooding, Jr. ejaculates out the window and his fluids land on a man's face.  The man is standing next to his gay lover and he says to him, "At least kiss me first."  A totally forced, brainless gag, but it made me bust out laughing!Gooding seems to be having fun in every scene, but I can't help but wonder, "Just WHAT the hell is he doing in this movie?"  I could understand if this movie were made prior to his Oscar-winning appearance in "Jerry Maguire," but he's the last actor who should volunteer to do such a low-grade film. I know he didn't do it for the money, because the film's budget must've been about 3 dollars.  But as I said, he does look like he's having fun and delivers some laughs.  I liked his gay dance number of "I'm Coming Out," where he's dressed up as a showgirl.  Horatio Sanz, one of the few new SNL cast members who actually makes me laugh, also delivers the goods. Former 007 star Roger Moore steals a few scenes himself.  And Roselyn Sanchez, of "Rush Hour 2" fame, graces the screen with her beauty.  Boy, is she hot!
I've heard some reviewers complain about the film's use of gay stereotypes. Now, in a more intelligent film, you may have the right to complain. With a film like this, why waste your breath?  If you want to see an accurate portrayal of gays, watch "Queer as Folk."  I'm sure no one walked into "Boat Trip" with the expectation that it would be a realistic portrait of homosexuals.  I know gay people don't always talk about sex and guys' sex organs, but with characters who went against that stereotype, how would we have a comedy?  If blacks and Hispanics are able to laugh at Archie Bunker comically bashing their people, gays can laugh at the stereotypes portrayed in this movie.Even for a rental, I'd give this movie just a mild recommendation, but it is somewhat of a guilty pleasure.  Every once in a while you feel like kicking back and watching a movie that requires no brain power.  Well...look no further.My score:  5 (out of 10)

Boat Trip succeeds where countless films have failed in providing insight into the multi-leveled complexity, ambiguity and tension inherent in gay/straight social interactions. Moreover, it brashly implies such interactions should be encouraged and even celebrated.Boat Trip is both more and less than a sensitive but hilarious portrayal of the gay sex cruise industry. It must be recognized as a clever commentary on the often overlooked fact that gay men and straight men differ in sexual preference but are similar in some other respects.The subtlety in the pretense of presenting what superficially appears to be a dreadfully juvenile and unfunny film as a means of illuminating the prejudices of the audience is utterly brilliant. So brilliant in fact that many of the more literal minded among us might leave the theater unaware of the profundity of the film and think they just endured one of the worst movies ever produced.That would be their loss. Approached on a more open-minded level this film will reveal startling truths such as the little recognized tendency for some gay men to behave in an effeminate manner and the even less explored reality that such behavior makes many straight men uncomfortable. Even more revealing is the film's shocking premise that being in the company of gays does not inevitably cause a straight man to desire to perform fellatio. By exploding this myth this film may do more to strengthen the ties between straight and gay men than any development since the advent of unisex hair styling salons.Most movingly, but with adroitly comedic undertones, this movie boldly suggests that, despite these hidden truths, gay and straight men can co-exist even within the confining environment of a seafaring vessel. Of course, the cruise liner is itself not merely the setting or "environment" in which this cinematic exploration occurs but indeed a metaphor for our ever more crowded society and the ultimate verity that we are all adrift in this mad world together. The failure of this film to receive its due from critics only shows the dangers of daring to break new ground in Hollywood.

My brain cells are frying! This is possibly the stupidest, unfunniest film I've ever seen.  I can't understand how anybody could derive any sort of satisfaction from it.  Somebody should form a posse, and go take away cuba gooding jr.'s oscar, as this man obviously should be a dishwasher instead of an actor.  If there ever was a career-killer, this is it!

Stupidity= 1)the state,quality,or fact of being stupid,in action,speech or notion.2)extremely dull.3)Boat Trip. Guess why you never seen this one in the movies. IT SUCKED. The story was good with two guys (straight guys) get booked on a gay cruise. Then of course there is one girl and the guy pretends to be gay. By now you have already realized that she will find out that he isn't gay and she will be made. Then he wins her back and the best part of the movie happens...end credits. It may be worth watching if you shut off your brain.

Jerry Robinson (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a man in love, who intends to get married with Felicia (Vivica A. Fox). However, she says no to his proposal, and has an affair with the guy who cleans her BMW. With a broken heart, he accepts the invitation of his best friend Nick Ragoni (Horatio Sanz) to spend his vacation on board of a vessel in a cruise, where many women would be available for them along the trip. After a discussion in the travel agency, the agent send them to a cruise for gays only. In the beginning of the voyage, the passenger ship rescues a group of Swedish women in the sea. They are going to a dispute of tanned skin. Nick pretends he is gay, gets close to Inga (Victoria Silvstedt), a gorgeous and tall Swedish woman, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Jerry also pretends being a gay, to get closer to Gabriella (Roselyn Sanchez), the beautiful and sexy dance teacher on board, and also falls in love with her. Along the voyage, the two straight friends  have unforgettable adventures and funny situations. Well, forgive me the purists, but this movie is very funny. It is very predictable, but it is impossible not to laugh of the situation where the characters of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Horatio Sanz  gets involved with. Roselyn Sanchez is very sexy and beautiful, being an attraction for the viewers' eyes. Roger Moore is also great in a role of a gay, which does not fit with his profile. I laughed a lot and found it a very funny movie. A great entertainment, not recommended for intellectuals. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `Cruzeiro das Loucas' (`Cruise of the Gays')

I can't believe a former Oscar winner is starring in a movie about a gay cruise. Either Cuba has picked mostly bad scripts or isn't offered much even after Jerry Mcguire.As for this movie, it wasn't terrible, but it was what you would call "hitting the nail on the head a few too many times". Pretty much all the jokes surround being gay. And it was funny a few times, like when Jerry and Nick first board the ship and don't know it is a gay cruise. And when Nick keeps getting hit on by Lloyd, who was funny because he was played by Roger Moore. As luck would have it for the only 2 straight guys on board, Jerry meets up with the hottest dance teacher ever, and the ship picks up a Swedish tanning team, which was great for Nick. When Nick sees them, he keeps saying it's OK to take your tops off, I'm gay. And he gets to rub lotion on them. I thought that was funny.But, the funniest part had to be when Nick sneaks into Inga's room, but Inga isn't there. Instead it's her old Coach. And Coach gets her freak on with her legs wrapped around Nick's head. That was funny. And Nick encounters Coach later with a bat that proves to be funny because Coach wants to demonstrate her talents for him.Will Ferrell has a cameo as a travel agent who books the duo on a gay cruise after Nick cusses out his "man." Ferrell is just funny.FINAL VERDICT: It was decent but definitely deserves the R rating. I mean, after Gabriella's demonstration with a banana, you can't blame Jerry for running to the window like that. I would recommend it for someone looking for some adult humor.

The movie itself was not too good, yeah i know.But it wasn't so bad neither, let's say it was a just okay movie.But the best thing about the movie: The girls.Beautiful blonde babes, delight us with their beauty, the Swedish bikini team, a lot of blonde beauty.But the best thing: Ooooooooooh man!!!, i thought i was going to have a heart attack: Puerto Rican Beauty Roselyn Sanchez, she is so damn sexy, not only beautiful, but a lot of sex appeal, i don't care if the movie was good or bad, just for having the pleasure of watching that Hispanic beauty it was good to see the film.

I stumbled on this movie by pure accident and I had absolutely no idea what kind of movie it was before I saw it. As I didn't recognize the name of that movie, I guessed that it would be really bad flop, but the movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise.The movie is not a masterpiece, but I found it quite entertaining, relaxed and maybe even hilarious. And I guess it is really hard to make a comedy that people would consider a masterpiece. I will definitely show this film to my friends and I think this film can be enjoyed more than once. It is somewhat clumsy film, but mostly in a positive way.The movie had a lot of silly jokes based on different kind of stereotypes like swedes and gays, but I think it worked quite well. And in my opinion none of the stereotypes was done in offending way and all of the characters were likable - even the promiscuous, but a bit "blond" Swedish woman and her strict coach. At least as a gay I didn't find the movie homophobic or the gay stereotypes offensive at all, unlike some comments.I think that the movie could have been a bit better if it wouldn't have had that explicit "I guess gays might be OK" phrase and the stereotypes had been a bit nastier. And with a bit better directing the movie could have had better fluidity.But I can recommend the movie even though it wasn't flawless. I especially liked the performance of Cuba Gooding Jr. But some straight guys might find the movie boring or maybe a bit embarrassing even though the movie has some relatively good looking women and the main characters are straight. And of course not all people like this kind of comedies with adolescent and a bit tasteless humour.

What shall one say? "Boat Trip" is both a disaster and comedy that works. The idea of Cuba Gooding and his friend getting aboard on a gay cruise is fun, it also works that Cuba falls in love with a women and so on, but the rest, except Roger Moore who really is great, is bad, really bad. The worst part is the Swedish sunbathing team.The movie is not good at all but could have been, worth seeing though for the part with Roger.4/10 (close to 3/10)

Uneccessary to ask how two loser guys can pay for such a luxury trip. Or why Roselyn can jump into a pool and dry in 2 seconds afterward. Or why she says she likes being on a ship with gay men because then she doesn't have to care about her make-up or her clothes when, while saying that, she wears a lot of make-up and very sexy clothes.Two scenes of unbelievable stupidity are worth mentioning. In one the fat guy somehow has sex with the babes' trainer instead with one of the babes. How this worked I don't know, since the room is obviously lit, so that you see exactly who's lying in the bed, but he nevertheless crawls between her legs, which leads to the two fighting across the room, while the trainer gets orgasmic when being shot through the room with a fire extinguisher.The other, absolutely worst scene, shows Roselyn Sanchez showing Cuba Gooding Jr. how she satisfies a man orally and she does it with a banana for about 2 minutes. The scene ends with Cuba Gooding Jr. ejaculating out of the window on the face of one half of a gay couple. This scene was one of the most painful scenes I ever had to watch in a cinema and the temptation to walk out has never been bigger.This movie is simply dead in the water in every way. Avoid it at all costs, please. Let the makers know what they did to the world by making this movie. Have mercy with yourself.

I watched "Boat Trip" in the privacy of my home on a rented VHS tape, which offered me the prerogative of exercising my fast forward remote option through much of the film. The premise of the story was that two straight men desperate for women are booked on gay cruise ship. The scripting of this film was subpar with many good opportunities missed for humor. Especially disappointing were the music and dance numbers, which could have been great fun. Roselyn Sanchez, who plays the ship's dance instructor, was a standout in the cast. Cuba Gooding Jr., also tried to make the best of a muddied script. One of the rare moments of inspired comedy was the casting of Roger Moore as one of the gay patrons aboard the ship. Roger cuts loose with some good lines and quirky moments in an otherwise lackluster comedy, which played more like a television sitcom than a feature film.

OK. Here's the thing...I made the colossal mistake of renting Boat Trip. Well, my wife got it, but we're not here to lay blame. I come not to praise, but to bury this rancid, steaming pile of dreck. Nothing, and I mean nothing, can make this unholy, homophobic mess into anything remotely watchable. You know its a bad film when not even the outtakes are funny.Somewhere there is a film executive that for some reason known only to his alien masters, is hell-bent on casting Cuba Gooding Jr as a comedy star.Maybe they were looking for a little of that "Snow Dogs" magic to rub off.Although a magnificent dramatic actor, he has all the subtlety of Eddie "Rochester" Anderson. He rolls his eyes, screams like a woman, and plays drunk like a five-year-old showing how daddy behaved at Aunt Lurleen's wedding.Boat Trip was so bad that I was completely surprised that Adam Sandler wasn't in it.Anyone know how to get this smell out of my sofa?

Man I don't understand why people come down so hard on this movie and personally, I thought that is was a good but not a great movie but it doesn't deserved all the negativity that you hear, anyway it's about Jerry (Cuba Gooding) who proposes to his snotty girlfriend Felicia (Vivian A. Fox) and he and his unsophisticated friend Nick (Heratio Sanz) decide to go on a cruise so they can meet some beautiful woman but after Nick cussing one of the cruise agents out, they wind up on a GAY CRUISE!! There's a funny appearance by Roger Moore who was a former James Bond and there's a funny scene by Felicia who tells a guy to be careful with her luggage cause she claims that they're worth more than what he makes in a year.When I saw this movie in the theater, they're was only 8 people, only 8, can you believe that.If you ask me if I would watch this movie again, the answer is yes but I'll wait till it comes out on DVD or the video.

I went to this movie after four days of being snowed in thinking it would be a fun comedy after developing cabin fever.  Boy, was I mistaken.  This movie was embarrassingly bad!  Not only was it not funny at all, it set the notion of positive gay images back 30 years.  Every character was a stereotype, which can be okay in some situations (i.e. The Birdcage, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, Queer As FolK, etc.) but, there were no redeeming characters at all!  I really wanted to walk out but kept thinking it had to get better than this.  But, alas it never did.  So, save your money and avoid this piece of garbage. I know I should have stayed home.

Were this movie released today, it would be the subject of a lot of ire. After botching his proposal, Cuba's character ends up suddenly single and depressed. After this goes on for some time, his friend convinces him to go on a singles cruise. After angering the travel agent that books their trip, they end up on a gay cruise. This is where the straight, gorgeous dance teacher comes in and instantly catches the main character's interest. There are a lot of anti-gay jokes here, but nothing hateful is said. I guess your level of ire depends on how sensitive a person you are. Funny movie, however probably a low point in Cuba's career.

I admit it. I laughed during this movie. I did. I am not ashamed about it. Too bad i only laughed a couple of times and this was all in the first 15 minutes of the movie. After that, the boat hit the iceberg so to speak and went down fast. I have no idea why Cuba Gooding Jr. take on this roles cause he is way to good for them. For the other people in the movie, they are not good for anything. The whole movie is based on gay jokes and after the first 2 that gets boring. This is like those movies in the early 90's, movies like ski school and such titles. The only difference is that they had boobs in them and were funny and Boat Trip doesn't have either. I rate this movie 3/10

After reading many reviews for this film I feared the worst... But after seeing this film I was pleasantly surprised... I'm gay myself so I thought I would be offended by this film, but I was not... It was all in good fun...For me personally I thought that Roger Moore was the best... His humour and style made this quite a special film...All in all it's not the best film I've ever seen, but it isn't the worst either... If you wanna have some laughs just go and see it...you will be pleasantly surprised too!

Review contains risqu√© spoiler, if you are easily offended do not read.Every critic and reviewer in the world seemed to hate this movie, but I have to disagree with them.  The movie is about two straight men that get put on a gay cruise ship.  Critics seem to be pointing out that the gay men are portrayed as just a bunch of freaky stereotypes.   I remember the poker players were very normal, and Roger Moore played a dignified man.  In my opinion, the gay men were not portrayed in a bad light.  Yes there were some stereotypes, but don't forget this is a comedy not a drama.  It would be pretty boring if everyone played a straight bland character.  All the characters are cartoonish in this movie.  Even Horatio Sanz plays a stereotype, fat stupid guy.  Critics make it seem like the gays are portrayed as a bunch of depraved perverts.  I just think that they are looking for a good time; it would be no different then a comedy movie about a party cruise filled with heterosexuals.  The heterosexuals would want to party and try to score, so I do not understand why it would be offensive to see gay men do the same.If you need a reason to see this movie, see it because of the banana scene. Roselyn Sanchez plays the cruise ship dance teacher that Cuba Gooding courts throughout the movie.  She has one of the sexiest scenes in any R rated movie, I have ever seen.  She shows Cuba how she can play with a banana. She shows how she licks, and nibbles and kisses the lucky banana.  It excites Cuba so much he has to run to the bathroom.  I am surprised this scene did not cause a NC 17 rating.  It was very risqu√©.
Yes, this is just a dumb movie, but sometimes dumb schlock movies can be a form of escapism. I will remember this movie as having a very special banana, James Bond, and sunbathing. 7/10, but then again I am the drunken_critic.

This isn't a must-see, nor is it a should-see, but it's not bad for a film this amateurish and low-brow.  Despite having watched a couple billion movies, I've never become an expert at pointing out things like continuity errors and other flubs of that sort, but you don't have to be a film scholar to notice the COUNTLESS times the boom mike appears in the shots.  I've seen student films shot with more professionalism.  Come on!The script is written with almost no intelligence.  Any perv with half a brain can cough up such a cheap set of gags like this.  But the sense of humor don't lie.  I did get a fair deal of laughs.  Not only that, but I was impressed by the gratuitous shots of half-naked women!  Viewers probably assume since it's a film about a gay cruise, there'd be nothing but half-naked guys, but think again!  I'm glad the director was thinking about the straight guys in the audience.Part of the film's charm is it reminds me of those late night adult comedies like "Bikini Carwash Company" and "Beauty School."  Lots of women in bikinis and nothing but tasteless sex gags.  You can probably see most of the punchlines from a mile away, yet you still want to laugh.  There's one scene where Cuba Gooding, Jr. ejaculates out the window and his fluids land on a man's face.  The man is standing next to his gay lover and he says to him, "At least kiss me first."  A totally forced, brainless gag, but it made me bust out laughing!Gooding seems to be having fun in every scene, but I can't help but wonder, "Just WHAT the hell is he doing in this movie?"  I could understand if this movie were made prior to his Oscar-winning appearance in "Jerry Maguire," but he's the last actor who should volunteer to do such a low-grade film. I know he didn't do it for the money, because the film's budget must've been about 3 dollars.  But as I said, he does look like he's having fun and delivers some laughs.  I liked his gay dance number of "I'm Coming Out," where he's dressed up as a showgirl.  Horatio Sanz, one of the few new SNL cast members who actually makes me laugh, also delivers the goods. Former 007 star Roger Moore steals a few scenes himself.  And Roselyn Sanchez, of "Rush Hour 2" fame, graces the screen with her beauty.  Boy, is she hot!
I've heard some reviewers complain about the film's use of gay stereotypes. Now, in a more intelligent film, you may have the right to complain. With a film like this, why waste your breath?  If you want to see an accurate portrayal of gays, watch "Queer as Folk."  I'm sure no one walked into "Boat Trip" with the expectation that it would be a realistic portrait of homosexuals.  I know gay people don't always talk about sex and guys' sex organs, but with characters who went against that stereotype, how would we have a comedy?  If blacks and Hispanics are able to laugh at Archie Bunker comically bashing their people, gays can laugh at the stereotypes portrayed in this movie.Even for a rental, I'd give this movie just a mild recommendation, but it is somewhat of a guilty pleasure.  Every once in a while you feel like kicking back and watching a movie that requires no brain power.  Well...look no further.My score:  5 (out of 10)

Boat Trip succeeds where countless films have failed in providing insight into the multi-leveled complexity, ambiguity and tension inherent in gay/straight social interactions. Moreover, it brashly implies such interactions should be encouraged and even celebrated.Boat Trip is both more and less than a sensitive but hilarious portrayal of the gay sex cruise industry. It must be recognized as a clever commentary on the often overlooked fact that gay men and straight men differ in sexual preference but are similar in some other respects.The subtlety in the pretense of presenting what superficially appears to be a dreadfully juvenile and unfunny film as a means of illuminating the prejudices of the audience is utterly brilliant. So brilliant in fact that many of the more literal minded among us might leave the theater unaware of the profundity of the film and think they just endured one of the worst movies ever produced.That would be their loss. Approached on a more open-minded level this film will reveal startling truths such as the little recognized tendency for some gay men to behave in an effeminate manner and the even less explored reality that such behavior makes many straight men uncomfortable. Even more revealing is the film's shocking premise that being in the company of gays does not inevitably cause a straight man to desire to perform fellatio. By exploding this myth this film may do more to strengthen the ties between straight and gay men than any development since the advent of unisex hair styling salons.Most movingly, but with adroitly comedic undertones, this movie boldly suggests that, despite these hidden truths, gay and straight men can co-exist even within the confining environment of a seafaring vessel. Of course, the cruise liner is itself not merely the setting or "environment" in which this cinematic exploration occurs but indeed a metaphor for our ever more crowded society and the ultimate verity that we are all adrift in this mad world together. The failure of this film to receive its due from critics only shows the dangers of daring to break new ground in Hollywood.

My brain cells are frying! This is possibly the stupidest, unfunniest film I've ever seen.  I can't understand how anybody could derive any sort of satisfaction from it.  Somebody should form a posse, and go take away cuba gooding jr.'s oscar, as this man obviously should be a dishwasher instead of an actor.  If there ever was a career-killer, this is it!

Alleged "comedy" about two straight men--Jerry (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Nick (Horatio Sanz)--who mistakenly get stuck on a gay cruise. Naturally all the gay men are blatantly offensive stereotypes--sex-obsessed, feminine, lisping and (of course) they all love drag. About a half hour in they run into a all-female Swedish sun tanning team (don't ask) so we can have juvenile sexist sex jokes and show women in tiny bikinis. A few offensive lesbian jokes are thrown in too.As a gay man I found this horribly offensive and not even remotely funny. A certain ice sculpture shown made me want to throw something heavy at the TV. I'm sick and tired of all gay men being shown as lisping, feminine people. To make things worse the film throws in a few short lines about how great gay people are--then goes right back to comic gay-bashing. And, worst of all, we have the very unfunny Will Ferrell do a cameo.The film has a few OK things--Roger Moore plays a gay man very well, the soundtrack is good and the overreaction of Gooding and Sanz when they find they're on the wrong cruise is somewhat amusing.The acting doesn't really help. Gooding overacts constantly--he got annoying real quick (can we take back that Oscar he got?); Sanz is obnoxious and unfunny; Roselyn Sanchez has a few good moments and Vicica A. Fox pops up briefly doing OK.This film was a HUGE bomb at the box office (for good reason) and is just a stupid piece of garbage. Everybody connected with this should be embarrassed. I really wish I could rate this lower than 1.

Stupidity= 1)the state,quality,or fact of being stupid,in action,speech or notion.2)extremely dull.3)Boat Trip. Guess why you never seen this one in the movies. IT SUCKED. The story was good with two guys (straight guys) get booked on a gay cruise. Then of course there is one girl and the guy pretends to be gay. By now you have already realized that she will find out that he isn't gay and she will be made. Then he wins her back and the best part of the movie happens...end credits. It may be worth watching if you shut off your brain.

Jerry Robinson (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a man in love, who intends to get married with Felicia (Vivica A. Fox). However, she says no to his proposal, and has an affair with the guy who cleans her BMW. With a broken heart, he accepts the invitation of his best friend Nick Ragoni (Horatio Sanz) to spend his vacation on board of a vessel in a cruise, where many women would be available for them along the trip. After a discussion in the travel agency, the agent send them to a cruise for gays only. In the beginning of the voyage, the passenger ship rescues a group of Swedish women in the sea. They are going to a dispute of tanned skin. Nick pretends he is gay, gets close to Inga (Victoria Silvstedt), a gorgeous and tall Swedish woman, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, Jerry also pretends being a gay, to get closer to Gabriella (Roselyn Sanchez), the beautiful and sexy dance teacher on board, and also falls in love with her. Along the voyage, the two straight friends  have unforgettable adventures and funny situations. Well, forgive me the purists, but this movie is very funny. It is very predictable, but it is impossible not to laugh of the situation where the characters of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Horatio Sanz  gets involved with. Roselyn Sanchez is very sexy and beautiful, being an attraction for the viewers' eyes. Roger Moore is also great in a role of a gay, which does not fit with his profile. I laughed a lot and found it a very funny movie. A great entertainment, not recommended for intellectuals. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `Cruzeiro das Loucas' (`Cruise of the Gays')

I can't believe a former Oscar winner is starring in a movie about a gay cruise. Either Cuba has picked mostly bad scripts or isn't offered much even after Jerry Mcguire.As for this movie, it wasn't terrible, but it was what you would call "hitting the nail on the head a few too many times". Pretty much all the jokes surround being gay. And it was funny a few times, like when Jerry and Nick first board the ship and don't know it is a gay cruise. And when Nick keeps getting hit on by Lloyd, who was funny because he was played by Roger Moore. As luck would have it for the only 2 straight guys on board, Jerry meets up with the hottest dance teacher ever, and the ship picks up a Swedish tanning team, which was great for Nick. When Nick sees them, he keeps saying it's OK to take your tops off, I'm gay. And he gets to rub lotion on them. I thought that was funny.But, the funniest part had to be when Nick sneaks into Inga's room, but Inga isn't there. Instead it's her old Coach. And Coach gets her freak on with her legs wrapped around Nick's head. That was funny. And Nick encounters Coach later with a bat that proves to be funny because Coach wants to demonstrate her talents for him.Will Ferrell has a cameo as a travel agent who books the duo on a gay cruise after Nick cusses out his "man." Ferrell is just funny.FINAL VERDICT: It was decent but definitely deserves the R rating. I mean, after Gabriella's demonstration with a banana, you can't blame Jerry for running to the window like that. I would recommend it for someone looking for some adult humor.

The movie itself was not too good, yeah i know.But it wasn't so bad neither, let's say it was a just okay movie.But the best thing about the movie: The girls.Beautiful blonde babes, delight us with their beauty, the Swedish bikini team, a lot of blonde beauty.But the best thing: Ooooooooooh man!!!, i thought i was going to have a heart attack: Puerto Rican Beauty Roselyn Sanchez, she is so damn sexy, not only beautiful, but a lot of sex appeal, i don't care if the movie was good or bad, just for having the pleasure of watching that Hispanic beauty it was good to see the film.

The only thing as stupid and vicious as this movie that comes to mind is the black-face performances of more than 70 years ago, in which black persons were mocked and ridiculed by white people with absurd black paint on their faces.The maliciousness of this film is unmatched by any other film I have seen in the past 50 years. All performers associated with it should be barred from ever performing in another American film or television show. For life.Viveca Fox - hold your head low. Cuba Gooding Jr. - You know better, yet you still did it. Horatio Sanz - you have participated in many homophobic skits on SNL; you could have used your talent for good, but you have chosen to use it to dehumanize good people. All associated with "Boat Trip" will go down in history for their association with the lowest point in American film history.

I stumbled on this movie by pure accident and I had absolutely no idea what kind of movie it was before I saw it. As I didn't recognize the name of that movie, I guessed that it would be really bad flop, but the movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise.The movie is not a masterpiece, but I found it quite entertaining, relaxed and maybe even hilarious. And I guess it is really hard to make a comedy that people would consider a masterpiece. I will definitely show this film to my friends and I think this film can be enjoyed more than once. It is somewhat clumsy film, but mostly in a positive way.The movie had a lot of silly jokes based on different kind of stereotypes like swedes and gays, but I think it worked quite well. And in my opinion none of the stereotypes was done in offending way and all of the characters were likable - even the promiscuous, but a bit "blond" Swedish woman and her strict coach. At least as a gay I didn't find the movie homophobic or the gay stereotypes offensive at all, unlike some comments.I think that the movie could have been a bit better if it wouldn't have had that explicit "I guess gays might be OK" phrase and the stereotypes had been a bit nastier. And with a bit better directing the movie could have had better fluidity.But I can recommend the movie even though it wasn't flawless. I especially liked the performance of Cuba Gooding Jr. But some straight guys might find the movie boring or maybe a bit embarrassing even though the movie has some relatively good looking women and the main characters are straight. And of course not all people like this kind of comedies with adolescent and a bit tasteless humour.

This isn't a movie to watch if you are looking for drama, ,major character strife and dvelopment or huge bucket loads of romance.  It delivers on precisely what it should, humor.  I expected absolutely nothing but horrific performances from some of the actors, not the least of which was Horatio Sands.  Amazingly I thought he did great work.  A lot of half naked (and fully naked) women for a gay cruise, but I suppose that was to make sure even the most skeptical of men liked the movie.  Roger Moore was hialrious. Cuba Gooding Jr was fantasitic as always.  The humor was childish and base, but that is what I was looking for the night I watched this gem.  All in all, a good mindless romp, and I think a better depiction of gay men in general.  They were the most normal people in the movie.  No emotional trauma, no slew of queens to fill you imagination with stereotypes.  Some rather every day people who just happened to be gay.  Excellent balance, and props to the producer/director/writers for accomplshing this.  Base humor without insulting the majority of it's own characters.bravo!

Cuba won an Oscar at some point, right? Just making sure I was thinking of the same Oscar winning actor Cuba Gooding, Jr. And one quick note just on the off chance the director or producer or anyone involved with the film might read this(I know, I know-why would they be on IMDb?)-Don't EVER CAST HORATIO SANZ IN A MOVIE, EVER!!! With that said let it also be known that quirky, dare I say wacky, gay humor staring "straight" men is lame. How many times do we, the viewing public, have to endure the premise of straight guys acting gay, mistaken as gays, or somehow caught up in a crazy mixed-up gay caper? Boat Trip is one of a many many examples of how willing millionaires are to throw their millions at any piece of crap thrown their way. Congrats to the army of monkeys on typewriters that submitted the Boat Trip script. Garbage.(Thank you to alcohol for giving me a hangover and putting me on the couch one afternoon out of reach of the remote)
