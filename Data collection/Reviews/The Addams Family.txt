The Addams Family has had a death... Fester Addams. But lo and behold, their lawyer knows a man who resembles Fester and if he passes the impostor off, could gain access to the family vault, full of treasures untold. But can the fake Fester survive the family's maniacal games? I don't have much experience with older incarnations of the Addams Family. So, I can't make an educated comparison. However, this film excels in every way: macabre, humorous and just plain eccentrically absurd. The casting is also amazing... Raul Julia in the performance of his career, and Christopher Lloyd in a very offebeat role even for him.This was a breakout performance for Christina Ricci (playing Wednesday Addams). Sure, it possibly typecast her into weird roles ("Casper", "Sleepy Hollow", "Pumpkin") but this is, beyond a doubt, where she fits. She can do drama ("Monster", "Black Snake Moan") but will always be America's goth girl.This film's dark humor is family appropriate -- cartoon violence, no nudity and marginal language. They simply do not make films like this anymore. Full credit must be given to the writer and director for bringing this family to life in a way that just cannot be repeated. Well, aside from the sequel.

Uncle Fester appears to have come home after a long period of absence, but is he an imposter?This is a pretty good comedy with great performances, a decent amount of jokes and some memorable scenes.The plot is for me the weakest aspect of the movie, but it gets us from start to finish and importantly allows for the characters and their actors to shine as much as possible.I enjoy the visuals which are very atmospheric, entertaining and technically well done. The cinematography and editing is excellent with lots of great shot compositions and lively camera movement. One of my favourite moments is the dance between Gomez and Morticia in the dark empty ballroom that superbly transitions mid dip to the actual ball in full swing.The production design is perfect for the tone of the film with wonderful set design in the Addams house, along with great costumes and props.It is the acting that gives it the extra quality, with Raúl Juliá on fantastic form as Gomez and Angelica Huston perfect as Morticia. Christina Ricci shows glimpses of the quality to come in her great Addams Family Values performance.

The Addams are an unique wealthy macabre family. Their corrupted lawyer Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya) owns money to a loan shark. Together they plot to inject a fake Uncle Fester Addams (Christopher Lloyd) into the family so he could search for the family treasure of gold Doubloons.Barry Sonnenfeld has created a well made Gothic Addams world. The family is played by Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, and Christina Ricci as young Wednesday Addams. This is mostly amusing especially what Wednesday keep doing to Pugsley. All the performers are wonderful. They have all the fun creating these amazing characters. The whole setup is incredibly inventive. The story itself is a bit of a grind. It would be better for the Family to clash more with the 'normal' suburban life. The regular jobs are funny. The kids should wreck havoc on regular school. That's the better sweet spot.

Barminess of the best kind, and every member of the cast is a joy to watch.

The Addams Family are one of the more recognisable families in TV history. With that in mind, let's skip the introductions and get straight to the chase.The performances in this movie are superb. It's a black, black comedy, and as such, it requires a certain kind of actor. The kind who has the right look, the perfect comedic timing, and the ability to deliver lines so deadpan it almost hurts.Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, and a young Christina Ricci somehow ALL manage to deliver. They're truly a delight to watch, delivering the most macabre lines without even coming close to cracking a smile, yet having me in stitches every time. Even Christopher Lloyd, playing a far more energetic character, manages to bring in a maniacal edge to the performance. I don't think there's an actor in the movie who doesn't understand the role they play.The script is great material for them to work with too, extremely witty, rarely if ever falling on it's face, and complemented with some fantastic sets. And let's not forget the music. From the legendary theme tune, to the harpsichord jingles accompanying the visual gags, to the booming organs during the heavier moments, it's spot-on. The whole movie works as one to capture *THE* Addams atmosphere, macabre as it's ever been.Sure, there's a plot too, but while it drives the movie on, you'd watch this movie for the wonderful theme, not for an intriguing plotline.It's a classic, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't seen it, or if you think you're too sensible for this kind of movie.

For some reason, the 90's and early 2000's were a bit of a heyday when it came to contemporary adaptations of kitschy old TV-shows and stories. Everything from "The Flintstones" to "Charlie's Angels"... from "The Brady Bunch" to "Dudley Do-Right"... they all got remade, rebooted and re-imagined for then-modern audiences. But strangely, almost all of them were redone in typically either a self-satirical or self-deprecating way. Almost like the filmmakers were ashamed of the properties they were meant to be paying tribute to. But one particular film among them stands out for doing quite the opposite. For creating a respectful, honorable and faithful adaptation that kept changes to a necessary minimum while simply delivering a bigger and wilder version of what came before.And oddly enough... that film was "The Addams Family", directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and released in 1991. Loosely inspired by the original comics of creator Charles Addams, while taking many cues and nods from the beloved 1960's sitcom, Sonnenfeld crafted a delicious and delightful comedic throwback that's filled to burst with classic Addams humor... with dark visual references, creepy double-entendres and plenty of cynical gallows humor gags. All the while, treating audiences to top-notch visuals and fantastic comedic turns from an all-star cast. "The Addams Family" might not be a perfect film... but it's darned entertaining and is a great riff on a classic piece of source material.The very creepy and kooky Addams Family is getting along fine, though Gomez Addams (the late and great Raul Julia) still laments the disappearance of his brother Fester 25 years earlier. But things take an interesting turn when the Addams' lawyer Tully (Dan Hedaya) ends up in too deep with devious loan shark Abigail (Elizabeth Wilson)... Out of time, Tully hatches a plan to pay off his debt- To disguise Abigail's oafish son Gordon (Christopher Lloyd) as the long-lost Fester, of whom he is the spitting image, so that he can infiltrate the Addams clan and discover their secret vault, which holds an immense treasure. Gordon is welcomed "back" into the clan under the pretense of suffering amnesia. Though the more time he spends with the devilish family, the more he grows attached to them, and the more he doubts he'll be able to go through with the plan...The peculiar thing about both this film and it's immediate follow-up "Addams Family Values" is that in many ways, they come across more as a series of clever but only tenuously connected vignettes than as singular, cohesive narratives... and yet, they both function quite well. The story lines are kept almost as an after-thought and only serve the basis of building and contriving funny situations to find our heroes in. And I think it actually works better this way given the nature of the material. The humor of the Addams Family was almost always about contrast and subversion of modern American ideals. And structuring the film in such a way to base much of the humor on almost random interactions with standard members of middle-class culture was a good way to go. It keeps the pacing light and refreshing, and only bogs itself down with the intricacies of plot and character development when needed.Visually, the film is a delightfully Gothic masterwork of manic energy thanks to Sonnenfeld's breezy and slick cinematography and use of movement and flow. It's got an energy to it that's all its own, and feels unique and even special in a weird way. This is complimented by the remarkable and even awe-inspiring set and costume design and Marc Shaiman's fabulous score, which incorporates that classic theme we all know and love and makes good use of it for varying levels of humor and suspense.And then there's the cast. My lord, this is just an exceptional ensemble of performers. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston frequently steal the show as the demented obsessive lovers Gomez and Mortitia, and their chemistry is out of this world. Particularly admirable is the childlike energy Julia exudes in every scene. Lloyd is a blast and a half as the would-be Fester, and he really nails the character in the best of ways. Jimmy Workman, Carel Struycken and Judith Malina round out the clan in fine supporting roles. And then- newcomer Christina Ricci is a complete joy as the sardonic daughter Wednesday in a wonderful performance. Hedaya and Wilson also do quite well as our devious and bumbling villains, and have some good scenes to shine.In all honesty, it's really hard to say anything critical of the film, because so much of it feels like it's accomplishing and excelling at every goal it sets out to achieve. And yet, there's just something about it that holds it just shy of perfection. Mainly lying in the intrusions of plot that pop in now and again and feel tacked on, and the fact that the film does feel very short and sometimes rushed. There's just some very small squabbles I have that are noticeable enough to hold it back a teeny bit. But even beyond those minor issues, I can't help but give "The Addams Family" a whole- hearted recommendation. It's fantastically fun and darkly hilarious, and I love every single second of it. And so I give it a very good 8 out of 10!

Gordon Craven (Christopher Lloyd), a dead ringer for The Addams' long lost Uncle Fester, poses as the missing relative in order to get his hands on the freaky family's fortune, hidden in the bowels of their spooky mansion.I find the humour in Barry Sonnenfeld's big screen debut for The Addams Family more amusing than side-splitting, but I can't fault the casting, the lively, spot-on performances ensuring that a good time is had throughout: in particular, Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester and Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams are inspired choices. Another aspect of the film that makes it more success than failure is the production design, from the wonderful interiors of the Addams' mansion, to the amazing costumes, to the top-notch special effects. Throw in a suitably ooky score by Marc Shaiman and what you have is an entertaining 99 minutes of morbid fun for all the family.The ghoulish gags come thick and fast, there's a fun musical number (the Mamushka!), Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) and Wednesday add some grand guignol to their school play, Elizabeth Wilson (as Gordon's loanshark mother Abigail) does a great comedic German accent, and Thing gets a job with FedEx!6.5/10 for the film, plus a bonus point for being the inspiration for one of the best pinball machines of the '90s (second only to The Twilight Zone). So that's 7.5/10, rounded down to 7 for that awful Addam's rap by M. C. Hammer (such an early '90s thing).

So here it is: a feature look into the lives of the ghoulish family that bears the name of their creator. In this case, Morticia (Anjelica Huston) and Gomez (Raul Julia) are raising their family, when long lost Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) rejoins the family. But there may be other people who want the Addams' house.Most people don't seem to realize that "The Addams Family" actually had some social commentary: everyone outside the Addams house considers them weird because they live differently, but they're actually a very loving family. As it was, "The Addams Family" was always better than "The Munsters" (cleverer and not as silly). But anyway, this is the feature, and it's one of the few TV-to-movie adaptations that got it right.

I was 8 when this film came out, and I remember it being a firm favourite. I've watched it again recently with my own children expecting to find it a bit frivolous and silly. Well, it is silly but in a brilliantly and cleverly delivered way. It's probably underrated to be honest. The sinister and deadpan acting is superb. The comic timing is on point. Despite their inexplicably weird and creepy antics, the cast portray such an endearing tight-knit family that they manage to make you want to be a part of it!I'm glad to say I still thoroughly enjoyed it nearly 30 years on and I spotted a lot more adult humour that I wouldn't have done as a child. As we know, that's often the key to a successful family movie.

As any afficiando of the REAL "Addams Family" (the TV series)knows, Uncle Fester is NOT an Addams -- he's called "Uncle"because he is Morticia's uncle, not Gomez's brother and thechildren's uncle; he was the go-between who arranged themarriage -- a major plot point of the TV series.  Nevertheless,the studio went ahead and based the movie on the premise that heis Gomez's brother, throwing away ANY credibility the film hadas a part of the Addams Family canon (or is it cannon?!).  Thankgoodness the cast was better than the script!

The Addams Family has the Addams family debt laden almost bankrupt lawyer Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya) & his wife Margaret (Dana Ivey) being invited to an annual séance held by the Addams family to remember Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) Brother, Fester who mysteriously disappeared 25 years ago. Back at his office Alford is threatened by loan shark Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) & her brute of a son Gordon (Christopher Lloyd) who want their money. Alford says he has no money but knows where there is a vault full of treasure & that her son Gordon looks exactly like Fester who disappeared 25 years ago & that with his help they can rob the Addams family of all their money. Later that night at the séance Gomez his wife Morticia (Anjelica Huston), Grandma (Judith Malina) & the two children Wednesday (Christina Ricci) & Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) are all astounded & delighted when Fester suddenly & rather unexpectedly turns up having supposedly been trapped in the Bermuda Triangle... Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld I thought The Addams Family was a fine film that provides solid entertainment but at the same time is maybe a little simplistic & not quite funny enough. The Addams Family first appeared as a series of cartoons by Charles Addams in 1935, then the character's were given their own TV series The Addams Family (1964 - 1966) which ran for 64 episodes, then Hanna-Barbera turned the concept into a short-lived cartoon series that ran for 16 episodes in 1973 & there was one spin-off TV special called Halloween with the Addams Family (1977) with most of the original cast which then brings us to this big budget film version. The script by Caroline Thompson & Larry Wilson with Paul Rudnick doing the rewrites moves along at a nice pace & isn't demanding, it has the sort of macabre black humour you would expect & is good fun. I have to admit that I personally didn't really laugh at any point, I certainly smiled & found it amusing but there weren't any big laugh-out-loud moments for me & anyone who doesn't guess the 'surprise' ending within the first ten minutes is either dead or just plain stupid. All the Addams Family character's are there including Lurch (Carel Struycken) the ridiculously tall butler & Thing the dismembered hand. The cast help the film enormously, Julia as Gomez is perfect as is Huston as Morticia while a young Christinia Ricci is very effective as Wednesday. With a supposed budget of $38,000,000 back in '91 The Addams Family is technically a very good looking & polished film with the Addamses' Gothic mansion standing out & almost being a character in it's own right. The special effects vary as one would expect from a film from '91, the special effects on Thing are surprisingly good while the wind & electricity effects at the end are awful by todays standards. The recognisable Addams Family theme tune is only used during the opening credits. Director Sonnenfeld keeps things moving with plenty of visual gags & slapstick comedy, although I felt the sequence where Wednesday cuts Pugsley's arm off in a school play & in return he slits her throat with fountains of spurting blood spraying from the wounds was somewhat disturbing & felt out of place as in the context of the film I think they did it for 'real'. I liked it, I'm not sure I would want to watch it again anytime soon. Definitetly worth a watch especially as you can probably find it cheap these days or catch it on TV for free, like I did in fact!

Entertaining film version of the 60's television series with Julia and Huston beautifully in sync as Gomez and Morticia, while Lloyd is a hammy riot as Uncle Fester. Art direction is impressive and the direction of Barry Sonnefeld is solid throughout. Followed by ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES in 1993.

Generally, speaking this a pretty "fun movie" for most people, kids and adults. I think "fun" is the adjective most people would use in describing this film.As one who remembered the television series, I thought I would check this out, too. Angelica Huston certainly didn't match Carolyn Jones' beauty but she, along with Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd and Christinia Ricci all were entertaining to watch.There certainly were no end to the colorful imagines, unique scenes and dialog, special-effects and - for those with a surround system, good sound. It all made for an entertaining and fast-moving film.I didn't find a lot of laugh-out-loud moments but it did bring a lot of smiles to my face. A lot of this is dark humor, so it helps to appreciate that type of comedy.

The Addams FamilyThe paradox of being in a family is that you can give other family members advice, but since you're family they won't listen to it.That happens to be the case in this comedy about an estranged uncle's homecoming.Decades after his brother Fester (Christopher Lloyd) departed over a disagreement, Gomez (Raúl Juliá) is overjoyed to have his brother back in his, his wife Morticia's (Anjelica Huston) and their children's, Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) and Wednesday's (Christina Ricci), lives.While a dead ringer of the long-lost brother-in-law, Fester is in fact part of a plan orchestrated by the Addams' lawyer (Dan Hedaya) to fleece the well-heeled weirdos of their riches.Based on the television series inspired by the comic strip, The Addams Family is aptly adapted in terms of kooky characters, ooky milieu and spooky humour.However, living with any uncle means having your address on the National Sex Offender Registry.

TV show was so much more *funny* than this, with slapstick jokes and sound effects. This movie loses the plot and tries to create a world different from the one which was created as an idea for a single panel comic and in a different time where the novelty has worn off.The comic and the TV show were both products of a day when people were learning to break out of the conformity of the 50's and early 60's. "Goth" hadn't become an industry yet which stores in the mall catered to.The TV show was *funny*. It wasn't "subtle". You didn't have to listen closely to the TV show to "get" it.For example, there was a weekly sequence seeing "regular" people left running out of the house frightened for their lives, often using under cranked film (fast motion). (not unlike the stock joke of the Casper cartoons) In this movie, however, the house guests are about as weird as the Addams. There was no "contrast".On TV, Jackie Coogan's Fester provided pure over the top belly laughs with a vaudeville like cadence. With his light bulb and self-destructive, one-man-three-stooges tricks (his regular headache cure gag), adding the sound effects made us all laugh out loud on a weekly basis.And let's not forget the fact that the original TV show actors defined those roles, esp Carolyn Jones and the guy (pardon me) who played Lurch. In this, however, Lurch dropped into the background. "Thing" had a much bigger role (thanks to CGI, we completely lost "the box" which was kind of the joke). To be sure, Angelica Houston was very good, but I thought they played up the sex/romance a half-note too much for what was really a kids show.Lastly, as a point of art, the TV show was in black and white, which was fitting for the macabre theme. This movie, however, was a lush production and the attention to detail was fantastic.But furniture doesn't make me *laugh*. (although I remember the laugh track on the TV show tried to make us laugh at it) Often, movie adaptations of TV shows will take some lingering question from the TV show and actually address it. Like, where did Gomez and Morticia meet? What exactly is "Thing"? (who is way overdone in the movie, thanks to CGI) So many missed opportunities.Instead, they create an story about Fester which was never part of the TV show, introducing a main character (the lawyer) which wasn't part of the original show, and again, focus on a very well done set design (yawn) to weave a story (the vault) which only takes you farther away from the characters you fell in love with or any real jokes.Perhaps it's because we have so many more choices today that "humorous" doesn't cut it any more.Interesting and pretty but outside of the pre-title sequence gag, simply not funny.

The Addams Family has had a death... Fester Addams. But lo and behold, their lawyer knows a man who resembles Fester and if he passes the impostor off, could gain access to the family vault, full of treasures untold. But can the fake Fester survive the family's maniacal games? I don't have much experience with older incarnations of the Addams Family. So, I can't make an educated comparison. However, this film excels in every way: macabre, humorous and just plain eccentrically absurd. The casting is also amazing... Raul Julia in the performance of his career, and Christopher Lloyd in a very offebeat role even for him.This was a breakout performance for Christina Ricci (playing Wednesday Addams). Sure, it possibly typecast her into weird roles ("Casper", "Sleepy Hollow", "Pumpkin") but this is, beyond a doubt, where she fits. She can do drama ("Monster", "Black Snake Moan") but will always be America's goth girl.This film's dark humor is family appropriate -- cartoon violence, no nudity and marginal language. They simply do not make films like this anymore. Full credit must be given to the writer and director for bringing this family to life in a way that just cannot be repeated. Well, aside from the sequel.

"The Adams Family" is a very funny film that is very under rated. With a great all star cast you get just what you expect, a great comedy. The TV show was already funny enough, and then the movie came and I was on the floor laughing. It's fun to see a happy dysfunctional family. No, I'm not talking about "The Osbornes". All the characters are great and you really get into it. If you can tell me that you honestly did not get one laugh from this film, there is something very wrong with you. Because it is a very funny film. I would recommend this to anyone. It's a good watch on any day.8/10

Charles Addams' dark characters get the film treatment in Barry Sonnenfeld's THE ADDAMS FAMILY, which is something of a cross between the actual New Yorker comics and the 1960s television show. Not trying to lean too far to either, the movie stays at a safe plane, even incorporating a vague plot involving two grifters, Gordon and Abigail Craven, posing as Uncle Fester and a renowned psychiatrist (Christopher Lloyd and Elizabeth Wilson) who are in cahoots to rob the Addams of their fortune and house. The problem arises when Craven seems to go against his take-the-money-and-run attitude and when the Addams themselves appear to enjoy every minute that they're being taken advantage of. It suits the dark humor well, because since the Addams live in an alternative universe of their own creation in which dark is light, repugnant is beautiful, pain equals pleasure, death is life, and chaos equals order, it leaves the door open for many of their Gothic eccentricities to pull the rug over Lloyd and Wilson over and over again. It's clever, although its only problem is the "needing to introduce the characters we all know" setup which like in all movies based on comics or television shows, looks obvious.But despite this, everyone is uniformly excellent. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston lend their looks to embody their cartoon counterparts and are the romantics at the heart of this decidedly perverse story. Christopher Lloyd is also great in his representation of Uncle Fester. But hands down: the one who walks away with the entire movie is Christina Ricci who plays Wednesday as if she were living the role day by day. There's a sadistic gleam in her eyes and her voice that not many child actors have and I think that any other actor of the time that this film was made would have been unable to fit into this difficult part. Other than that, the tone of the movie is perfect: as dark as it wants to be, but never letting its Gothic setting drown it in an inescapable mire. On the contrary, we're constantly aware that this is a typical American family who lives upside down and who are happy in being so even when we gawk and cringe at their oddities.

Uncle Fester appears to have come home after a long period of absence, but is he an imposter?This is a pretty good comedy with great performances, a decent amount of jokes and some memorable scenes.The plot is for me the weakest aspect of the movie, but it gets us from start to finish and importantly allows for the characters and their actors to shine as much as possible.I enjoy the visuals which are very atmospheric, entertaining and technically well done. The cinematography and editing is excellent with lots of great shot compositions and lively camera movement. One of my favourite moments is the dance between Gomez and Morticia in the dark empty ballroom that superbly transitions mid dip to the actual ball in full swing.The production design is perfect for the tone of the film with wonderful set design in the Addams house, along with great costumes and props.It is the acting that gives it the extra quality, with Raúl Juliá on fantastic form as Gomez and Angelica Huston perfect as Morticia. Christina Ricci shows glimpses of the quality to come in her great Addams Family Values performance.

The Addams family are far from being normal but they are rich and as such are their attorney's only chance of getting rich. Tully has debts up the yazoo and the only thing that stops his knees being violently replaced with fresh air is the fact that Abigail Craven's son Gordon looks eerily like Gomez's missing brother Fester. Shaving his head, Gordon enters the Addams home as Fester and tries to use his spare time to get into the family vault. However Gomez's joy at his return is gradually marred by a sneaking feeling that Fester is not himself  meanwhile Wednesday has no such doubts at all and is out to expose the impostor.One of the few remakes that actually works, The Addams Family takes the Gothic humour of the TV series and makes it feel fresh and entertaining. The story is essentially a nail for us to hang our coats on so we can watch the gags come but even with this it is actually pretty good. Making one of the family a "new character" is a clever way of adding to the formula without having to bring in new characters to lead the film and it does work. Within this frame the twisted comedy is rather entertaining and, although rarely laugh out loud funny, it is still consistently amusing and enjoyable.The cast are roundly good. Julia is a perfect Gomez and Huston is a great Morticia despite the latter being a fairly one-note affair. Lloyd is enjoyable in the lead and manages to do well to carry the "new character" aspect of Fester without disrupting the dynamic of the family. Ricci is excellent and the only downside is that the film doesn't give her enough to do; Workman is also good and has good chemistry with her. Hedaya, Wilson, Ivey and others are strong in support and generally do well to shore up the story.Overall a kooky affair that is enjoyable in you are in the mood for its particular brand of dark silliness. The plot is more than enough to act as a frame, the jokes maybe don't hit many real highs but they do consistently get very close to the target and the fact that the actors all buy into the joke makes it that little bit better. An enjoyable remake that succeeds because it has the strength to stand as its own beast.

The Addams are an unique wealthy macabre family. Their corrupted lawyer Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya) owns money to a loan shark. Together they plot to inject a fake Uncle Fester Addams (Christopher Lloyd) into the family so he could search for the family treasure of gold Doubloons.Barry Sonnenfeld has created a well made Gothic Addams world. The family is played by Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, and Christina Ricci as young Wednesday Addams. This is mostly amusing especially what Wednesday keep doing to Pugsley. All the performers are wonderful. They have all the fun creating these amazing characters. The whole setup is incredibly inventive. The story itself is a bit of a grind. It would be better for the Family to clash more with the 'normal' suburban life. The regular jobs are funny. The kids should wreck havoc on regular school. That's the better sweet spot.

Barminess of the best kind, and every member of the cast is a joy to watch.

The Addams Family are one of the more recognisable families in TV history. With that in mind, let's skip the introductions and get straight to the chase.The performances in this movie are superb. It's a black, black comedy, and as such, it requires a certain kind of actor. The kind who has the right look, the perfect comedic timing, and the ability to deliver lines so deadpan it almost hurts.Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, and a young Christina Ricci somehow ALL manage to deliver. They're truly a delight to watch, delivering the most macabre lines without even coming close to cracking a smile, yet having me in stitches every time. Even Christopher Lloyd, playing a far more energetic character, manages to bring in a maniacal edge to the performance. I don't think there's an actor in the movie who doesn't understand the role they play.The script is great material for them to work with too, extremely witty, rarely if ever falling on it's face, and complemented with some fantastic sets. And let's not forget the music. From the legendary theme tune, to the harpsichord jingles accompanying the visual gags, to the booming organs during the heavier moments, it's spot-on. The whole movie works as one to capture *THE* Addams atmosphere, macabre as it's ever been.Sure, there's a plot too, but while it drives the movie on, you'd watch this movie for the wonderful theme, not for an intriguing plotline.It's a classic, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't seen it, or if you think you're too sensible for this kind of movie.

Certainly there are going to be those who take this comic variation on "Tales From the Darkside" as something that was influenced by the devil with its irreverent take on family structure and focus on characters who obviously seem to take great pleasure in following some seemingly morbid characteristics. Yes, they are indeed absolutely ookie, with gorgeous mom Morticia (that's Anjelica Huston, not Cher...), extremely sexy dad Gomez (a very dreamy Raul Julia), the witch-like Grandma (Judith Malina), portly Pugsly (Jimmy Workman) and the very dour Wednesday (a delightful Christina Ricci) not the Brady Bunch, not the Cunninghams, not the Cleavers, and very far even from the Munsters. Gomez has been mourning the disappearance of his brother Fester (which means "to rot") for years, and every year like clockwork on the anniversary of his disappearance, they do a séance to try and find out where he is. Thanks to some con-artist clients of the family attorney (Dan Heydara), "Fester" does show up during the séance, actually the son of a hard-hearted con-artist (a very funny Elizabeth Wilson). She pretends to be his psychiatrist, having "discovered" him in the midst of the Bermuda triangle. Cynical Wednesday is suspicious, and this eventually leads to the Addams being removed from their own home so "Fester" and mommie dearest can find out where the family fortune is being hidden.Lavishly filmed with fun special effects and gorgeously morbid art direction, the film version of the famous comic strip and 1960's T.V. series is perfectly cast. It seems that nobody could replaced Carolyn Jones as the luscious Morticia, but Ms. Huston does a phenomenal job and is obviously having a ton of fun, especially after being haggard as an evil witch just a few years earlier. Raul Julia is not as tongue-in-cheek as John Astin was, but his Gomez is certainly unforgettable with an undeniable sex appeal. Anjelica and Raul have amazing chemistry, making it clear that this morbidly old married couple are very much in love. Those who saw Raul in the original Broadway cast of "Nine" will agree that after playing that role, nobody else could have done this role justice.Some people are going to confuse Dana Ivey, the talented stage actress who plays Heydara's neglected wife Margaret Alford, with the legendary Maggie Smith as they do have similar facial features. Lots of old friends truly thought Ivey's character in "The Color Purple" was Maggie Smith until I pointed out her name in the credits. What happens to her character here is truly bizarre, but in a magnificently funny way. Carel Struycken is an amusing Lurch, but unfortunately never gets to say Ted Cassidy's famous line, "You Rang?", only being silent with the exception of a few grunts when things don't seem right to him. Take the satanic references with a grain of salt or you might find yourself as crazy and ookie as the bizarre characters (both dead and alive) here. The film also features a magnificent party sequence which utilizes a classic movie tradition of switching from two characters dancing alone to the switch to the party in full swing. When Julia and Lloyd break into "The Mamushka", the film becomes absolutely delightful. There's really nothing offensive in the things the Addams family does. It's just all silly fun, and if you watch it with that in mind, you won't need to "cleanse" yourself afterwords with a hot shower.

For some reason, the 90's and early 2000's were a bit of a heyday when it came to contemporary adaptations of kitschy old TV-shows and stories. Everything from "The Flintstones" to "Charlie's Angels"... from "The Brady Bunch" to "Dudley Do-Right"... they all got remade, rebooted and re-imagined for then-modern audiences. But strangely, almost all of them were redone in typically either a self-satirical or self-deprecating way. Almost like the filmmakers were ashamed of the properties they were meant to be paying tribute to. But one particular film among them stands out for doing quite the opposite. For creating a respectful, honorable and faithful adaptation that kept changes to a necessary minimum while simply delivering a bigger and wilder version of what came before.And oddly enough... that film was "The Addams Family", directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and released in 1991. Loosely inspired by the original comics of creator Charles Addams, while taking many cues and nods from the beloved 1960's sitcom, Sonnenfeld crafted a delicious and delightful comedic throwback that's filled to burst with classic Addams humor... with dark visual references, creepy double-entendres and plenty of cynical gallows humor gags. All the while, treating audiences to top-notch visuals and fantastic comedic turns from an all-star cast. "The Addams Family" might not be a perfect film... but it's darned entertaining and is a great riff on a classic piece of source material.The very creepy and kooky Addams Family is getting along fine, though Gomez Addams (the late and great Raul Julia) still laments the disappearance of his brother Fester 25 years earlier. But things take an interesting turn when the Addams' lawyer Tully (Dan Hedaya) ends up in too deep with devious loan shark Abigail (Elizabeth Wilson)... Out of time, Tully hatches a plan to pay off his debt- To disguise Abigail's oafish son Gordon (Christopher Lloyd) as the long-lost Fester, of whom he is the spitting image, so that he can infiltrate the Addams clan and discover their secret vault, which holds an immense treasure. Gordon is welcomed "back" into the clan under the pretense of suffering amnesia. Though the more time he spends with the devilish family, the more he grows attached to them, and the more he doubts he'll be able to go through with the plan...The peculiar thing about both this film and it's immediate follow-up "Addams Family Values" is that in many ways, they come across more as a series of clever but only tenuously connected vignettes than as singular, cohesive narratives... and yet, they both function quite well. The story lines are kept almost as an after-thought and only serve the basis of building and contriving funny situations to find our heroes in. And I think it actually works better this way given the nature of the material. The humor of the Addams Family was almost always about contrast and subversion of modern American ideals. And structuring the film in such a way to base much of the humor on almost random interactions with standard members of middle-class culture was a good way to go. It keeps the pacing light and refreshing, and only bogs itself down with the intricacies of plot and character development when needed.Visually, the film is a delightfully Gothic masterwork of manic energy thanks to Sonnenfeld's breezy and slick cinematography and use of movement and flow. It's got an energy to it that's all its own, and feels unique and even special in a weird way. This is complimented by the remarkable and even awe-inspiring set and costume design and Marc Shaiman's fabulous score, which incorporates that classic theme we all know and love and makes good use of it for varying levels of humor and suspense.And then there's the cast. My lord, this is just an exceptional ensemble of performers. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston frequently steal the show as the demented obsessive lovers Gomez and Mortitia, and their chemistry is out of this world. Particularly admirable is the childlike energy Julia exudes in every scene. Lloyd is a blast and a half as the would-be Fester, and he really nails the character in the best of ways. Jimmy Workman, Carel Struycken and Judith Malina round out the clan in fine supporting roles. And then- newcomer Christina Ricci is a complete joy as the sardonic daughter Wednesday in a wonderful performance. Hedaya and Wilson also do quite well as our devious and bumbling villains, and have some good scenes to shine.In all honesty, it's really hard to say anything critical of the film, because so much of it feels like it's accomplishing and excelling at every goal it sets out to achieve. And yet, there's just something about it that holds it just shy of perfection. Mainly lying in the intrusions of plot that pop in now and again and feel tacked on, and the fact that the film does feel very short and sometimes rushed. There's just some very small squabbles I have that are noticeable enough to hold it back a teeny bit. But even beyond those minor issues, I can't help but give "The Addams Family" a whole- hearted recommendation. It's fantastically fun and darkly hilarious, and I love every single second of it. And so I give it a very good 8 out of 10!

Gordon Craven (Christopher Lloyd), a dead ringer for The Addams' long lost Uncle Fester, poses as the missing relative in order to get his hands on the freaky family's fortune, hidden in the bowels of their spooky mansion.I find the humour in Barry Sonnenfeld's big screen debut for The Addams Family more amusing than side-splitting, but I can't fault the casting, the lively, spot-on performances ensuring that a good time is had throughout: in particular, Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester and Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams are inspired choices. Another aspect of the film that makes it more success than failure is the production design, from the wonderful interiors of the Addams' mansion, to the amazing costumes, to the top-notch special effects. Throw in a suitably ooky score by Marc Shaiman and what you have is an entertaining 99 minutes of morbid fun for all the family.The ghoulish gags come thick and fast, there's a fun musical number (the Mamushka!), Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) and Wednesday add some grand guignol to their school play, Elizabeth Wilson (as Gordon's loanshark mother Abigail) does a great comedic German accent, and Thing gets a job with FedEx!6.5/10 for the film, plus a bonus point for being the inspiration for one of the best pinball machines of the '90s (second only to The Twilight Zone). So that's 7.5/10, rounded down to 7 for that awful Addam's rap by M. C. Hammer (such an early '90s thing).

So here it is: a feature look into the lives of the ghoulish family that bears the name of their creator. In this case, Morticia (Anjelica Huston) and Gomez (Raul Julia) are raising their family, when long lost Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) rejoins the family. But there may be other people who want the Addams' house.Most people don't seem to realize that "The Addams Family" actually had some social commentary: everyone outside the Addams house considers them weird because they live differently, but they're actually a very loving family. As it was, "The Addams Family" was always better than "The Munsters" (cleverer and not as silly). But anyway, this is the feature, and it's one of the few TV-to-movie adaptations that got it right.

I had the opportunity to sit down in 2021 and watch the 1991 "The Addams Family" again. I believe this is my third time watching it since it was released 30 years ago. My, how the time flies.Writers Caroline Thompson and Larry Wilson definitely managed to write a storyline that was entertaining in many ways, because "The Addams Family" has something for everyone in the family. And the best part is that they definitely managed to keep the feel of the old classic very much alive in this 1991 version.The storyline had laughs and lots of quirky characters and locations. The amount of details in every single set was just spectacular. And you can easily watch the movie a second time just to pay attention to everything in the background and on the sets. Thumbs up for the props and decoration teams for those achievements.The acting performances in "The Addams Family" were good, but of course with a cast that included Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd, Anjelica Houston, Dan Hedaya and Christina Ricci, then you will find yourself in for a good time."The Addams Family" had a lot of interesting wardrobes and costumes, and the make-up department were also doing great jobs.Sure, with 30 years on its back, "The Addams Family" is showing some signs of aging, in terms of special effects. But I will say that the special effects actually still are passable even today.My rating of director Barry Sonnenfeld's 1991 "The Addams Family" lands on a seven out of ten stars.

As any afficiando of the REAL "Addams Family" (the TV series)knows, Uncle Fester is NOT an Addams -- he's called "Uncle"because he is Morticia's uncle, not Gomez's brother and thechildren's uncle; he was the go-between who arranged themarriage -- a major plot point of the TV series.  Nevertheless,the studio went ahead and based the movie on the premise that heis Gomez's brother, throwing away ANY credibility the film hadas a part of the Addams Family canon (or is it cannon?!).  Thankgoodness the cast was better than the script!

A good, nay great, movie version to the classic 60s series. Raul Julia is great as Gomez, as is Christopher Lloyd as Fester. The story is sound, pretty much better than the sequel. This is a comedy with slightly dark themes, but that doesn't mean the family can not enjoy it. Barry Sonnenfeld is a genius.

I was 8 when this film came out, and I remember it being a firm favourite. I've watched it again recently with my own children expecting to find it a bit frivolous and silly. Well, it is silly but in a brilliantly and cleverly delivered way. It's probably underrated to be honest. The sinister and deadpan acting is superb. The comic timing is on point. Despite their inexplicably weird and creepy antics, the cast portray such an endearing tight-knit family that they manage to make you want to be a part of it!I'm glad to say I still thoroughly enjoyed it nearly 30 years on and I spotted a lot more adult humour that I wouldn't have done as a child. As we know, that's often the key to a successful family movie.

The Addams Family has the Addams family debt laden almost bankrupt lawyer Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya) & his wife Margaret (Dana Ivey) being invited to an annual séance held by the Addams family to remember Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) Brother, Fester who mysteriously disappeared 25 years ago. Back at his office Alford is threatened by loan shark Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) & her brute of a son Gordon (Christopher Lloyd) who want their money. Alford says he has no money but knows where there is a vault full of treasure & that her son Gordon looks exactly like Fester who disappeared 25 years ago & that with his help they can rob the Addams family of all their money. Later that night at the séance Gomez his wife Morticia (Anjelica Huston), Grandma (Judith Malina) & the two children Wednesday (Christina Ricci) & Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) are all astounded & delighted when Fester suddenly & rather unexpectedly turns up having supposedly been trapped in the Bermuda Triangle... Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld I thought The Addams Family was a fine film that provides solid entertainment but at the same time is maybe a little simplistic & not quite funny enough. The Addams Family first appeared as a series of cartoons by Charles Addams in 1935, then the character's were given their own TV series The Addams Family (1964 - 1966) which ran for 64 episodes, then Hanna-Barbera turned the concept into a short-lived cartoon series that ran for 16 episodes in 1973 & there was one spin-off TV special called Halloween with the Addams Family (1977) with most of the original cast which then brings us to this big budget film version. The script by Caroline Thompson & Larry Wilson with Paul Rudnick doing the rewrites moves along at a nice pace & isn't demanding, it has the sort of macabre black humour you would expect & is good fun. I have to admit that I personally didn't really laugh at any point, I certainly smiled & found it amusing but there weren't any big laugh-out-loud moments for me & anyone who doesn't guess the 'surprise' ending within the first ten minutes is either dead or just plain stupid. All the Addams Family character's are there including Lurch (Carel Struycken) the ridiculously tall butler & Thing the dismembered hand. The cast help the film enormously, Julia as Gomez is perfect as is Huston as Morticia while a young Christinia Ricci is very effective as Wednesday. With a supposed budget of $38,000,000 back in '91 The Addams Family is technically a very good looking & polished film with the Addamses' Gothic mansion standing out & almost being a character in it's own right. The special effects vary as one would expect from a film from '91, the special effects on Thing are surprisingly good while the wind & electricity effects at the end are awful by todays standards. The recognisable Addams Family theme tune is only used during the opening credits. Director Sonnenfeld keeps things moving with plenty of visual gags & slapstick comedy, although I felt the sequence where Wednesday cuts Pugsley's arm off in a school play & in return he slits her throat with fountains of spurting blood spraying from the wounds was somewhat disturbing & felt out of place as in the context of the film I think they did it for 'real'. I liked it, I'm not sure I would want to watch it again anytime soon. Definitetly worth a watch especially as you can probably find it cheap these days or catch it on TV for free, like I did in fact!

Entertaining film version of the 60's television series with Julia and Huston beautifully in sync as Gomez and Morticia, while Lloyd is a hammy riot as Uncle Fester. Art direction is impressive and the direction of Barry Sonnefeld is solid throughout. Followed by ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES in 1993.

Extremely enjoyable update to the old t.v. show retains the eccentric spookiness and oddball humor of old, then proceeds to update the warped family familiarity with a rousing sense of decadent glee. The unexpectedly classy affair benefits greatly from the amazing casting that went into choosing all the Addams clan. What is nothing short of ensemble perfection, a sense of fun had by all on set during production remains undeniably infectious throughout, lending the amusing proceedings a distinct level of class.Directed by easily digestible Barry Sonnenfeld, The Addams Family may be a bit intense for young kids but should stay a delight to all others. A wonderful, gentle perversity that hangs over the entire family might have pushed things a little too far to justify this family film to the younger set, but will stay surprisingly balanced with an outpouring of heart and morality,simply flipped inside out here, for comedic intent.Wonderful set and prop design mixed with it's politely warped sense of humor would have been enough to make Addams Family the success it became, although it was the brilliant casting which continues to uphold a credibility for this film. Led by the outstanding (and sadly missed) Raul Julia, nearly every single family member wears their role with an unreal amount of dignity, making the fairly standard plot completely memorable.

This film adaptation of the Addam's Family has its moments and is watchable, but there are just certain things about it that do not work that cause it to be a sort of all right comedy rather than a really good one. Part of the problem is the casting, but then the casting is good as well. Raul Julie is perfectly cast as Gomez and is a very bright spot in this film. A shame Addam's Family Values was not his last movie instead of the horrid Street Fighter movie. Christopher Lloyd plays Fester, and while he is not my first choice the man can play any role from Fester, to Judge Doom, and even a Klingon. Anjelica Houston on the other hand had the look of Morticia, but her voice was at times barely audible. I did not care for grandma either as that person would thankfully be played by Karol Cane in the sequel and she did a much better job even though that role was largely ignored in both films. The story here is rather different, as we have a person trying to pass off this dude whose mother is like some loan shark or something as the long lost Uncle Fester. So we have a guy trying to make heads or tails of the strange family while trying to get the family fortune. There are some funny scenes and long dead sections to the movie as well. The kids Wednesday and Pugsley provide the biggest laugh for me though during there school play. All in all it was not a bad film, just needed a bit of work. I actually feel the sequel is a more complete film than this one, but not by much.

Generally, speaking this a pretty "fun movie" for most people, kids and adults. I think "fun" is the adjective most people would use in describing this film.As one who remembered the television series, I thought I would check this out, too. Angelica Huston certainly didn't match Carolyn Jones' beauty but she, along with Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd and Christinia Ricci all were entertaining to watch.There certainly were no end to the colorful imagines, unique scenes and dialog, special-effects and - for those with a surround system, good sound. It all made for an entertaining and fast-moving film.I didn't find a lot of laugh-out-loud moments but it did bring a lot of smiles to my face. A lot of this is dark humor, so it helps to appreciate that type of comedy.

The Addams FamilyThe paradox of being in a family is that you can give other family members advice, but since you're family they won't listen to it.That happens to be the case in this comedy about an estranged uncle's homecoming.Decades after his brother Fester (Christopher Lloyd) departed over a disagreement, Gomez (Raúl Juliá) is overjoyed to have his brother back in his, his wife Morticia's (Anjelica Huston) and their children's, Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) and Wednesday's (Christina Ricci), lives.While a dead ringer of the long-lost brother-in-law, Fester is in fact part of a plan orchestrated by the Addams' lawyer (Dan Hedaya) to fleece the well-heeled weirdos of their riches.Based on the television series inspired by the comic strip, The Addams Family is aptly adapted in terms of kooky characters, ooky milieu and spooky humour.However, living with any uncle means having your address on the National Sex Offender Registry.

This movie is a brilliant masterpiece. A very simple movie by the way. I dunno what else was expected by the fans. But this movie is amazing.

"The Addams Family" is a story by Charles Addams, which has later turned into a series and movie franchise. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and written by Caroline Thompson and Larry Wilson, this movie is one of the wackiest and funniest I have seen in a while. The movie focuses on the relationship of the Addams Family, a weird, bizarre and scary family that worships death, séance and everything that is gothic. Every member of the family is special in his own way: Morticia and Gomez who are the leaders of the family, Wednesday and Pugsley are the little rascals who make death pranks on each other, we then have Granny, Lurch the waiter and Thing. Fester Addams is the long lost brother of Gomez who comes back and creates a lot of chaos. All the cast members are fantastic and act so well under the whole makeup on their faces. Christopher Lloyd is great as Fester and steals the show with every appearance of his. The interactions of the family members with each other is brilliant and well written due to the script. The better the script is attached to the story, the better the movie gets. Overall this is a very funny film that aged well and is always a pleasure to watch again.

TV show was so much more *funny* than this, with slapstick jokes and sound effects. This movie loses the plot and tries to create a world different from the one which was created as an idea for a single panel comic and in a different time where the novelty has worn off.The comic and the TV show were both products of a day when people were learning to break out of the conformity of the 50's and early 60's. "Goth" hadn't become an industry yet which stores in the mall catered to.The TV show was *funny*. It wasn't "subtle". You didn't have to listen closely to the TV show to "get" it.For example, there was a weekly sequence seeing "regular" people left running out of the house frightened for their lives, often using under cranked film (fast motion). (not unlike the stock joke of the Casper cartoons) In this movie, however, the house guests are about as weird as the Addams. There was no "contrast".On TV, Jackie Coogan's Fester provided pure over the top belly laughs with a vaudeville like cadence. With his light bulb and self-destructive, one-man-three-stooges tricks (his regular headache cure gag), adding the sound effects made us all laugh out loud on a weekly basis.And let's not forget the fact that the original TV show actors defined those roles, esp Carolyn Jones and the guy (pardon me) who played Lurch. In this, however, Lurch dropped into the background. "Thing" had a much bigger role (thanks to CGI, we completely lost "the box" which was kind of the joke). To be sure, Angelica Houston was very good, but I thought they played up the sex/romance a half-note too much for what was really a kids show.Lastly, as a point of art, the TV show was in black and white, which was fitting for the macabre theme. This movie, however, was a lush production and the attention to detail was fantastic.But furniture doesn't make me *laugh*. (although I remember the laugh track on the TV show tried to make us laugh at it) Often, movie adaptations of TV shows will take some lingering question from the TV show and actually address it. Like, where did Gomez and Morticia meet? What exactly is "Thing"? (who is way overdone in the movie, thanks to CGI) So many missed opportunities.Instead, they create an story about Fester which was never part of the TV show, introducing a main character (the lawyer) which wasn't part of the original show, and again, focus on a very well done set design (yawn) to weave a story (the vault) which only takes you farther away from the characters you fell in love with or any real jokes.Perhaps it's because we have so many more choices today that "humorous" doesn't cut it any more.Interesting and pretty but outside of the pre-title sequence gag, simply not funny.
