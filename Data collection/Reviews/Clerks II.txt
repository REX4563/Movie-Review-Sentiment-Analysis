I had reservations about a sequel to the cult classic, Clerks. The charm of the first movie was how Kevin Smith relied on convoluted dialogue and effervescent characters to launch the movie. I was not confident that he could return to those roots after 12 years of success under his belt.Fortunately, this movie does not disappoint. Smith's trademark witty dialogue is ubiquitous as ever. The characters argue and rant about meaningless topics with the same intensity as family members faced with the decision to pull the plug. O'Halloran continues to portray Dante as the hapless slacker who simultaneously makes us feel sorry for him and urges us to smack him for not doing anything about his circumstances. The latter feeling is embodied by Anderson, who plays the irresponsible malcontent, Randall. Fans of the first Clerks movie will be amused by their continued antics. One of the new characters is Becky, played by Rosario Dawson. Dawson performs admirably, making us fall in love with the free spirit who took a wrong turn in life and ended up managing a Mooby's restaurant. Becky provides a refreshing contrast to the stodgy and suffocating Emma, played by Mrs. Smith. Emma appears a bit too one-dimensional, but her purpose as Dante's fiancée is clearly to show yet another disappointing facet of Dante's life. Another new character is Elias, played by Trevor Fehrman. Elias's role is a bit over-the-top as the hobbit-obsessed geek whose life is enriched by the promise of a live-action Transformers movie. The flaw is that Elias is too repressed and weird and cannot garner much sympathy from the audience. This might be Smith's intent, as we enjoy a little schadenfreude every time Randall torments him.The story is fairly basic and picks up where the first movie leaves off. Dante and Randall seamlessly move from the end of Clerks to the beginning of Clerks II. This may seem sad, since they are now 30-somethings working as clerks, and that is intentional. The sequel shifts the focus from young clerks trying to determine what to do with their lives to clerks approaching middle age trying to figure out why they're still in their dead-end jobs. The story of Dante whining about his life and Randall putting him in his place is rehashed from the first movie, but with a sudden afflatus, Dante is finally able to do something about it.The humor is still strong with Kevin Smith, as he throws ridiculous sight gags at us in between the labyrinthine dialogue about Transformers, Star Wars, racial slurs, blogs, and life in general. Fans of Kevin Smith naturally will enjoy this movie and do not need to fear that he has "sold out." It's hard to say if newcomers will enjoy the movie. If they are into the humor of the movie, then they logically should already be aware of the first Clerks, as well as Dogma and Chasing Amy. I can only suggest for the moviegoer who is unaware of Kevin Smith's credentials to go rent Clerks. If the story bores you, then Clerks II probably won't appeal to you, though there are more sight gags that may appeal to some audiences. Those who are easily offended are also urged to stay away, as this movie contains scenes of profanity, bodily fluids, and (for most people) sexual deviance.All in all, it is a solid movie. It has a few pacing problems (or did at the screening) but nothing that negatively impacts the movie. Some scenes are utterly ridiculous, but it is par for the course for this type of movie.

Clerks II is a worthy successor to Kevin Smith's 1994 debut, "Clerks.".The continuing adventures of Dante and Randal speed along with witty dialogue, insightful social commentary, and a touching look at various levels of life, responsibility and most importantly, love.There's a lot of the requisite dirty jokes, but they enhance the golden center of the flick. I laughed and cried in many of the same moments. But mostly, I watched two characters I had grown up with grow up themselves and face some of the dilemmas I've faced since I went from being a teenage slacker to an adult. I was reminded of a better time in my life, and also reminded to look forward to the future.Brian O'Halloran knocks Dante out of the gate, with pitch-perfect delivery. I believe that this is still the Dante we knew - just a bit older. Jeff Anderson takes Randal, an already amazing character, and brings him to a new level. Randal becomes even funnier - and more touching. Trevor Fehrman's Elias adds the perfect foil for Randal's brand of mischief. Jay and Silent Bob, the dynamic duo, are also back - proving that Jason Mewes is back in top shape, and really enjoying making you laugh.~Steve

I don't know what to say really, to me, both the original Clerks and the sequel are equally great.But I have to give props to the sequel more for the very simple fact it took the original premise and took it a little farther this time. What was once a convenience store is now a Burger Joint, and what was once a duo is now a trio, and what was once Black and White is now...color! There was B&W for the very first and last scenes though, but that's pretty much all.So yes, newcomer Trevor Fehrman as the lovable Elias adds great to the sequel. His love and affection for Lord of the Rings and Transformers can never get any better than that...well, I take that back. What's better than that is seeing the Star Wars loving Randal bash it to the ground, kick it, set it on fire, and spit on the ashes. Look out for everything else he spews out of his mouth, its all worth it.Jason as Jay once again is nothing less than awesome as well. Despite his recent heroin abuse act a few years back, he came back clean and better than ever. He's probably funnier than he was in any of the other View Askew movies, with Bob kicking it back and providing some real laugh out loud one liners. I wish him the best, cause as the great guy he is in real life, he deserves it.Dante, Becky, Emma, and everyone else (except for the Donkey Sacker) was just kinda in the background, unfortunately. While Kevin tried to do some of his "sentimental" moments in this movie to try not to make it a pure comedy, I just give him credit in trying. I thought the whole story was okay, it really had its moments (especially the Go Kart discussion and Randal's confession in the end, every girl in the theater were really tearing for the guy) but it was nothing more than that. The real show stealers for me were with the pessimistic Randal and the carefree Jay and Silent Bob, they really made the movie worth it and honestly they were the real reason why I wanted to see this anyway.And be honest, that's the real reason why you wanna see it too. Kevin Smith "tell it like it is" wit + Jay + Randal = Clerks. Especially Clerks II. Overall, worth the time and money. Especially for the Kevin Smith devotee and View Askew-phile. And definitely worth the purchase as soon as it hits DVD shelves.And yeah, Ben afflek and Jason Lee also make appearances too. Small but mildly effective.

This movie was everything I hoped it would be. It is especially (or maybe even primarily) for fans of Kevin Smith's "ViewAskewniverse". (And yes, it's in color...mostly.) Also, there was no subtitle...it was titled simply "CLERKS II"...no "the second coming" or "the passion of the CLERKS".I don't want to hit any spoilers this soon before the movie comes out, but the general idea is that it is a "coming of age" story for the Gen X slackers, who finally in their 30s find themselves not having advanced very far in life, careers, personally or even in general (this is primarily Dante's role, anyway). He decides (due to some things beyond his control) to FINALLY move on, "grow up", get married and leave Leonardo New Jersey and its band of bad influences behind.Randall, of course, is not so keen at his only friend leaving NJ, is perfectly happy living with his parents and doing as little as possible, and a good part of the movie is spent on Randall challenging Dante's decision and exploration of their friendship.Now, this may sound like some kind of melodrama, BUT IT ISN'T!!! That basic story is weaved between the plot devices, smart dialogue and gritty or "pushing the limits" humor we come to expect from Kevin Smith.There's Jay and Silent Bob of course, who have a mini-character arc/growth experience themselves, Jason Lee in with an all new character for one short scene (I think this is his 5th new character in Kevin's ViewAskew franchise), and Ben Affleck with a mercifully brief (one or two line) cameo. Jay and Bob's antics are always a great break from the other action, never an intrusion, even when they are TRYING to intrude, by making asses of themselves (literally) in the background of the primary action.Plus, a couple of new characters, a crew member at Mooby's (a McDonald's type fast food joint) named Elias who is a very religious, naive counterpoint to Randall's ruthless and jaded personality, and therefore the butt of many jokes/gags. His and Randall's comments regarding "Lords of the Ring" vs "Star Wars" are priceless and vintage Kevin Smith.Another new character, "Becky", is played by Rosario Dawson, who is the manager at the same restaurant. She plays the part of the good female friend who depends on Dante and challenges Dante to consider if he really wants to settle for a girl who is merely tolerable.As with the first "CLERKS", this movie pushes the limit of what can be put on film and actually get released in theaters. I hope the more controversial parts make the final cut because I think the shock value that makes you say "NO THEY DIDN'T!" is a valuable part of the equation and expected from this film franchise. Without giving anything away, there are particularly two of the films ongoing jokes, one having to do with bestiality, the other in which some very NON-PC racial terms are used, REPEATEDLY, including the "N-word". No one else has the guts to address these issues and make them funny. 'Cept Kevin Smith.Finally, the movie really does have a story without being preachy, we're treated to known characters without it being a nostalgia-fest (for instance, Jay and Bob are in their signature places in front of the Quick Stop, but Jay utters not once "Snootchie Bootchies"...but not to fear, he finds a NEW way to crack us up...Bob's discovered a way to keep Jay's mind off of drugs. Fans of Jay will NOT be disappointed.)And the movie goes through an interesting story arc, with surprises and twists resulting in a satisfying ending.I'm concerned that the more risqué scenes might have to be neutered for ratings' purposes; hopefully not. If so, they will be on the DVD for sure. I can say that even in very conservative KC, the audience laughed A lot, no one walked out during the most "offensive" part, and everyone seemed to really enjoy the edgy wit, smart dialogue as well as the bathroom humor that kept the film at a fun pace.*EDIT-I've since read that 3 people walked out, which isn't bad from an audience of nearly 500 and with a movie this edgy. I guess I was enjoying myself too much to notice the walkouts!The movie is also more realistic than some of the other View Askew movies; more like Clerks, obviously. None of the comic book type stunts like in "Mallrats" (Silent Bob's batman utility belt and flying around with a cape) or "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" (with the fake lightsaber scenes and flying on the bicycle through a wall and not getting hurt) or all the special effects,mythology and divine interventions of "Dogma" (Alanis Morisette as God appearing at the end to save the world). There are no scenes to groan at and think "ah, right, like that could happen". These characters are real, and real things happen to them, no special abilities, creatures from the underworld or new age messiahs. Just real people that many of us can relate to.In closing...don't take your grandmother to this movie. It is full of obscene language, profane concepts, drug references, "unnatural" sexual references, etc. Unless you know your girlfriend is hip and not easily offended, test her with a DVD of "CLERKS" first to see if she "gets" the humor.Otherwise, get a gang of friends, go to this movie and get ready to laugh your freakin' BUTT off!

Most main-stream comedies would try to have over-the-top fantasy life premises, in which the audience can lance on, because how bizarre & surreal, it is. However, some of the better comedies, known for their Seinfeldian humor, idiosyncratic focus on more conversational everyday stuff that some audience might find mundane. Then, there are those, whom can mix, both of them, well-enough, that the audience can find, the simplest of premise, funny. This is one of those movies. Directed & written by Kevin Smith, Clerks 2 is a follow-up to the highest successful 1994's movie, Clerks and Smith's sixth feature film to be set in the View Askewniverse AKA Kevin Smith's fictional universe from the first film. Ten years after the events in Clerks, Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) & Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) find themselves working at a local fast food joint, after their previous work, Quick Stop Store, burned down, a year ago. Dante has plans to move away from town and get married, but Randal cannot yet, allow his long-last friend to leave, without one last goodbye party. While, Randal set up the party at the workplace, Dante is struggles with his mixed feelings for his current boss, manager, Becky Scott (Rosario Dawson) & his love for his fiancée, Emma Bunting (Jennifer Schwalbach). Will the goodbye party go according plan, or will Dante & Randal find themselves, making a bigger mess than before? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, it's nice to see Kevin Smith retackling his old films; however, in retrospect, it's generally viewed as Smith trying to rebound after his commercial failure in his non-View Askewniverse movie, 2004's Jersey Girl. Much like the original movie, the sequel to Clerks, also take place over the course of one day, and loosely connected with a series of small discussion skits and gags. But unlike, the first movie, the movie doesn't make too much jokes about the settling of the film. For a movie that mostly takes place at a fast food joint. I'm really surprised on the lack of jokes about junk food. You would think, the movie would be full of it. Anyways, the movie instead, tackles other issues, such as debates over movies, sexual positions, religion, racism, and romantic love versus pragmatic life choices. Like the first movie, the dialogue is rife with obscenities. Over 130 curse words, to start, as well as a lot of homosexual & racism slurs. The movie also has explicit jokes about bestiality, rape & others that some people might feel uncomfortable with. For me, the oddest thing about the film is having Jason Mewes as Jay do his 1991's the Silence of the Lambs, "Goodbye Horses" dance. That was really out of place & inappropriate. Even with all those, kinda offensive humor and jokes. There were some witty, somewhat heartfelt moments in the film. I did like the whole Jackson 5 'ABC" musical number. For the most part, all of these scenes serves mostly as filler. It really takes forever, for the weak main plot to kick in. The fact that the majority of that scene was ad-libbed, added to the pacing problems. While, the movie is not well-paced. The acting in this film was pretty good for the most part. The main actors, supporting actors, and cameos, all did their parts, very well. I have to say, my favorite actor in this, had to be Trevor Fehrman as Elias Grover, Dante and Randal's new co-worker at the Mooby's fast food chain. It sucks that he hasn't acted since this movie, because I found him to be, very funny. The worst acting in the film has to go to Jennifer Schwalbach. I'm really didn't buy anything, she was saying. Her performance was so wooden. Another thing, that was way different from the first movie, is how this sequel was in color & not in black & white. But as mentioned in the DVD commentary for this film, the entire film was desaturated, a bit after filming, because the colors were far too bright and cheery. In my opinion, I didn't mind that it was, as it adds so much to the cartoony astrosphere, giving the film a far, greater look. It reminds me, so much of the early 2000's animated TV Series Clerks with its style. Overall: While, Clerks 2 will never outshine the original. I have to say, it's still a watchable guilty pleasure of mine. Worth checking out. Face it tiger. You just hit the jackpot!

I've been lucky enough to see this movie twice, and I can't wait to see it again in theaters. I laughed so hard I NEED to see it again to hear what I missed the first two times around, and I even shed a tear or two.Kevin Smith is in fine form as Dante and Randal return 10 years older. But are they 10 years wiser? After the Quick Stop is unexpectedly shut down, Dante and Randall continue their meager existences at Mooby's, a fast food chain. The movie takes place on the day before Dante is set to leave for broader horizons with his overbearing fiancé, played by the stunning and impressive Jennifer Schwalbach.Can Dante really survive outside of the comfortable confines of New Jersey? What will Randal do without his hetero-lifemate? And speaking of hetero-lifemates, what are Jay and Silent Bob up to these days? Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson give stellar performances. Dante and Randal are back and in fine form. Trevor Fehrman is an excellent addition to the cast as Elias, new coworker and perfect whipping boy for Randal. I absolutely fell in love with Rosario Dawson as Becky, Mooby manager, several times over. Jay and Silent Bob pop in and out without disappointment. I can't tell you how fantastic it is to see Jason Mewes looking healthy and in top form.Those looking for the intelligent, wry and vulgar humor of Clerks will find it here. Can you top screwing a dead guy in a bathroom? Oh yes, you can! Those who appreciated the heart of Chasing Amy will find that here too. Only Kevin Smith can pull off that combination. The soundtrack is a must buy as well.I can't wait to see this movie again.

Look, I'll be honest with you. I think that Kevin Smith is the anti-Christ. His films in recent years have been dismal. I found Dogma to be one of the worst movies ever and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was made to appeal to the lucrative stoner/Generation X market who think that films like this are 'da bomb'. Sigh, I remember the days when people actually spoke correct English and we really need another World War to thin out their ranks a little. The aforementioned movies only make them believe it's funny to be hopeless losers that they are. It seems that Kevin Smith is incapable of writing a movie that isn't soaked in f-words or pee and fart jokes. Clerks II is NO exception, but he's reined in the stupidity and added enough real human drama to make it bearable for the rest of us.The store from the first movie has burnt down due to Randal's incompetence and he and Dante are forced to work in Mooby's, a Cow-themed fast-food restaurant with the lovely Becky (the utterly gorgeous Rosario Dawson, who I would do 86 ways) and Elias an ultra-Christian who seems to be an exaggerated cross between Rod AND Tod Flanders. I imagined the whole movie would be nothing more than them having inane conversations and swearing a lot while Jay and Silent Bob sell weed to the kiddies in the parking lot. And while we do get this there was, surprisingly, a bit of real story in there too.Dante is about to get married to a gorgeous woman who adores him (but only because she has given up on the shallow, good-looking men) and is leaving NJ forever the next day for sunny Florida. Despite the fact that their lives go nowhere, Randal really doesn't want him to go and would-be true-love Becky tries to convince him that he's fooling himself.It's the dilemma of finally being able to move on in life with a future of mock-happiness or making the most of what's right in front of you that elevates this higher than the crude JASBST and the wildly over-rated Dogma. But don't think for a minute that this film will not have extensive conversations on ass-to-mouth (Becky likes it!!!), comparisons of Star Wars to Lord of the Rings (or Nerd vs Nerd in other words) or arguments of non-racist racist words (Porchmonkey? Never heard of it!) or a man raping a donkey for the viewing pleasure of drunken idiots. And do look out for the 'Who's Your Buddy' Jesus on Jay's T-shirt.Although he does write some good scenes and his work in comic-books is brilliant (Bluntman and Chronic, read it!)I 'm still not convinced of Smith's ability as a director. One superficial and completely pointless dance number doesn't make up for the endless static shots of inside a fast-food joint, but at the very least it's slicker and more professional than Dogma, a film I will never forgive for its infinite rubbishness.

A decade later, Dante and Randal still work at Quick Stop and RST Video, respectively. That is, until it burns down. Rather than moving on with their lives, the pair take up employment at another demeaning and degrading locale... the fast food restaurant.Shortly after this film's release, it was sitting as an 8.3 out of 10 on IMDb. That's a little bit high. Even now, at 7.8, it seems a stretch. I mean, I know you love Kevin Smith, but you know as well as I do this is not his best film.But nor is it his worst. This film hit me hard in the gut, made me sad. Because I finally felt I was saying goodbye to characters I grew up with. I've seen all the films opening day in the theater since 1995's "Mallrats" when I was 14, so almost half my life has been shared with these characters. They are my cinematic family. And after this one, I don't ever expect to see them again.See, the strength of this film is our connection to the characters. We have to identify with them. My generation, and especially my clique, knows what it's like to approach 30 and still be in a dead-end job or have no job, no family and no viable housing. We know what it's like to waste time and talk about nothing. Not that this is a good thing, but these are the truisms in Dante and Randal: we all need to grow up, but some of us do it in ways others will not.Not to say the film isn't funny. Granted, it's not as funny as "Clerks", "Chasing Amy" or "Mallrats". I see there being two periods in Smith's writing of humor, with these three being in the first period and all other films in the second. His drift from witty dialog to action sequences is his downfall. The references are stale (Transformers? Lord of the Rings?) and the dialog, Smith's best skill, is weak and thin. More conversation, less filler and this film would have been a masterpiece. But I appreciated the "Silence of the Lambs" jokes and other oddities. And I certainly liked the cameos being kept to a minimum -- the lack of "faces" is what made Clerks even better. Although Affleck is drifting back into obscurity, I think. Not unlike Steve Guttenberg.I felt that the jokes and references were forced. The parallels between this film and the first were nice, but again forced. I mean, the "not even supposed to be here today" line was not needed, though the Milk Maid shot was good. Attempts to make this a big movie left me feeling distant -- did we need so many hit songs? Do we need Dante driving around contemplating life? I don't know... not the film I would have wanted to see.If you like bestiality, smut talk, go-karts and some great racial slurs, this film is for you. If you don't, it's not. And if you never knew these characters before, you might want to acquaint yourself first. If you're going to be saying goodbye, you may as well say hello first.

I liked Clerks. It was funny and refreshing at the time. That was 1994. I had high hopes for Kevin Smith. Fast forward over a decade and that hope has vanished. Clerks 2 is utterly dreadful. This is absolutely pathetic film-making. Smith has never been much of a visual director; his films have always been slow and static. But now any flair for dialogue he ever had has gone. What you get are completely unlikable characters spouting foul-mouthed chunks of awful bile. None of it is funny or fresh. It all sounds like the stuff a desperate fanboy might come up with. And I guess that's all Kevin Smith is at heart. He should go and work in a video store where he might amuse the odd customer with a speech about Lord of the Rings. His career in film should be over.Contender for worst sequel of all time. A disgrace.

You'll like Clerks 2. If you liked the original Clerks, this is Kevin's Smith's masterpiece. It mirrors the original Clerks, but it shows how much he's grown as a writer and a director. From the black and white/color shots, to the crane shot (a *beep* crane shot), to just the placement of people in the Camera shots...everyone one of these things contributed to the overall enjoyment of this movie.The script is crisp and tense, with just the right amount of reality and joy. There is no long monologues or actors stumbling over lines. There's this freedom in Smith's work that doesn't feel forced or attempting to impress anyone...but he impresses everyone with just the beautiful way of putting together his scenes.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, but especially those who are on the verge of 30 and the rest of your life. It definitely impressed me and touched me in a way that I didn't expect. It's a fitting end to the Jersey Viewaskewverse.Hopefully, in 10 years, they do another Clerks movie. I'd love to see these guys in their 40s. Randal and Dante are the most engaging of couples and Smith writes such an engaging story about friends in their 30s without pandering or compromising the vision of their piece.You will love it. Even if you hated all his other movies past Clerks, you will love it.

Thank you Kevin Smith, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. I am so glad that I saw Clerks 2 while here in Sacramento for training. I saw it alone of course and could not stop being entranced! There were tons of gross parts which is EXCELLENT!!! Jay and Silent BOB were excellent as always. Of course, Dante and his friend contemplate life like CRAZY, especially the other guy. The argument about Lord of the Rings vs. The Star Wars trilogy had me DYING OF LAUGHTER!!!! This movie will be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I am glad I saw this. Keem em' coming Kevin Smith because you are a genius.The end

Brain O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes, Rosario Dawson, Kevin Smith, Trevor Fehrman and Jeniffer Schwalbach. (Cameos by: Ethan Suplee, Jason Lee, Ben Affleck). Directed by Kevin Smith. After 12 years and many films, Kevin Smith returns with his rude, crude and brass sense of humor with the obscene clerks. After a fire burns down the Quick Stop Dante (O'Halloran) and Randal (Anderson, in an Oscar worthy role, I know right) are forced to enter the world of a fictional Disney like restaurant Mooby's. Where the duo do the same thing in the job, make fun of customers and a geeky LOTR fan Elias (Fehrman). While Dante is in the mist of a life crisis and has to make the decision of whether to leave his pal Randal forever. And the return of the new and improved Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), not to mention a lovely credit to Levine's "Tuck" Dance from "Silence of the Lambs", creepy in full form. "Clerks 2" is a nice return to the counter culture world, that does ring true. Smith truly has an ingenious sense of humor and also throws in a few dramatic notes in the end, kudos to Anderson on the tidy delivery. The funniest movie I've seen since the "40 Year Old Virgin"

Wow, the return of the clerks, indeed! I went to a pre-screening last night of Clerks II and let me say that it was actually really good. The title, as Mr. Smith explained, has been simplified to undersell the movie so fans and moviegoers in general will be pleasantly surprised when they see it. So here is my contribution to word-of-mouth advertising: if you liked ANYTHING about Clerks I, go see Clerks II. More of the same and then some; and then some more. I have always been hit-or-miss with Kevin Smith and, sadly, the original Clerks was still my favorite of the group. And this movie is his best yet.(In fact, the only way I can appreciate "Mallrats" is to watch it with the audio commentary on.) To me, Mr. Smith is a lot funnier when he's just add-libbing. He said during his Q & A, last night, that they spent more time on this movie in pre-production than all the other movies combined and it shows. I am sure he was kidding but this movie is actually well written, very well acted (Rosario especially; she is the topping that is going to make this movie sell), and just well thought out in general. Good pacing (especially with the sight gags, one after another) and the Decalogue that I've come to appreciate is priceless. Like the argument over which franchise has the better "Return" movie; "Lord of the Rings" or "Star Wars". Clerks II has become my favorite movie of the summer and I hope it becomes the sleeper hit of the summer because it is just that good. Oh, and Kevin, if you're reading this, sorry about the title, I am sure you pondered it. Maybe if you hadn't already used "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"?

I only had a few problems with the original. A few of the lines were spit out too fast. The worst one came from the hockey player who wanted the Gatorade. Other than that it was groundbreaking and funny.In Clerks II O'Halloran has regressed as an actor - or is it that Smith regressed as a director? That long stare as Dante watches the fire department crew was terrible. Some of the reactions to Randal's comments in Moobies were way overblown. The constant looking over to Randal in the car got repetitively annoying.Emma looks like a man. What the hell happened to her looks? Her head is shaped like a knee bone, and that make out scene with Dante made me want to throw up.Elias acts like a retard and is too much of a dork to be believable.Chicks who use the word pooter and cooch disgust me. Those are terms guys use more, and are funnier when guys say them. Pus sy sounds better coming from a girl.Randal's crying to Dante in the jail cell totally took away from his character. We don't need drama to balance the comedy. Plus he contradicts himself when he suggests laser bars, then when Jay says plastic like in X-men Randal tells him to keep it in the real world. The funniest part of his tirade was when he talks about taking a criminology class. "What were we trying to become - Batman?" I'm not totally dissing this movie and still watch it when it comes on cable, but I turn the channel before the jail scene. It's just too unbelievable - the way Dante pined away at working at the Quick Stop and now he wants to buy it and work there forever. Clerks was a classic - Clerks 2 is more of a wannabe, even though it is still entertaining.

I saw an early screening of C2 and I must say that the flick is way better than anyone thought it would be. Mr. Smith is back in prime form and I would dare to say that this is quite possibly his best work yet. Granted, this is not a film for everyone but, if you are not offended by purposefully vulgar humor, C2 should be on your "must see" list. Dante (Brian O' Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) are back with their humorous banter as if a whole decade had not gone by since we saw them last. Dante/Brian is practically flawless as the straight man while Randal/Jeff is one of the funniest actors around and their on-screen chemistry is simply wonderful. The new guy Elias (Trevor Fuhrman from "Now You Know") is a clever addition to the group while Rosario Dawson shines her irresistible charm on this little world of dysfunctional employees. The combination is a winning one and, if you add an healthy dose of Jay and Silent Bob to the mix, and even a musical number worthy of "The Blues Brothers", you have quite possibly the best comedy of the summer. This film is enjoyable even if you are not familiar with the original Clerks, but it's even better if you are. To top it all off, Kevin Smith shows us that he has learned from his mistakes and has now mastered the fine art of balancing comedy with truly heartfelt moments, staying clear of the sappiness that sunk "Jersey Girl". At the end of the film there were quite a few shiny eyes in the audience... bravo Mr Smith! You pulled off your best trick yet.

What I like about Kevin Smith is that he doesn't shy away from anything risqué. Bestiality, racial epithets, dick and fart jokes....the list goes on. What I can't believe is that he still keeps coming back to the same old territory. I saw this in the theatre and I did laugh out loud (yes I LOL'ed) but I left wondering what Kevin will do next. I saw the original Clerks back in '94 when all the rage was beating down my door. No intentional rhyme there. I loved it, just like I loved Mallrats and Chasing Amy to follow. But then came Dogma. Then Jay & SIlent Bob Strike Back....then that other one with Affleck & Tyler that I still can't bring myself to view. It was nice to see Dante and Randal trot about in their usual jerky way for my enjoyment. However, I did wonder if the counter-jockeys will come back when they're pushing 60 for Clerks 3 : The Golden Years. I figure it will take place in a convalescent home with a hot nurse teasing their aged tender vittles while they bicker about their failed lives. I just hope that Mr. Smith can come back with something besides Jay & Silent Boob. I was tired of it a few movies back. Yet i still find myself checking these movies out. I guess I still am a Kevin Smith fan. I also like cookies....especially ones with chocolate....a little bit of macadamia doesn't hurt either.

I had reservations about a sequel to the cult classic, Clerks. The charm of the first movie was how Kevin Smith relied on convoluted dialogue and effervescent characters to launch the movie. I was not confident that he could return to those roots after 12 years of success under his belt.Fortunately, this movie does not disappoint. Smith's trademark witty dialogue is ubiquitous as ever. The characters argue and rant about meaningless topics with the same intensity as family members faced with the decision to pull the plug. O'Halloran continues to portray Dante as the hapless slacker who simultaneously makes us feel sorry for him and urges us to smack him for not doing anything about his circumstances. The latter feeling is embodied by Anderson, who plays the irresponsible malcontent, Randall. Fans of the first Clerks movie will be amused by their continued antics. One of the new characters is Becky, played by Rosario Dawson. Dawson performs admirably, making us fall in love with the free spirit who took a wrong turn in life and ended up managing a Mooby's restaurant. Becky provides a refreshing contrast to the stodgy and suffocating Emma, played by Mrs. Smith. Emma appears a bit too one-dimensional, but her purpose as Dante's fiancée is clearly to show yet another disappointing facet of Dante's life. Another new character is Elias, played by Trevor Fehrman. Elias's role is a bit over-the-top as the hobbit-obsessed geek whose life is enriched by the promise of a live-action Transformers movie. The flaw is that Elias is too repressed and weird and cannot garner much sympathy from the audience. This might be Smith's intent, as we enjoy a little schadenfreude every time Randall torments him.The story is fairly basic and picks up where the first movie leaves off. Dante and Randall seamlessly move from the end of Clerks to the beginning of Clerks II. This may seem sad, since they are now 30-somethings working as clerks, and that is intentional. The sequel shifts the focus from young clerks trying to determine what to do with their lives to clerks approaching middle age trying to figure out why they're still in their dead-end jobs. The story of Dante whining about his life and Randall putting him in his place is rehashed from the first movie, but with a sudden afflatus, Dante is finally able to do something about it.The humor is still strong with Kevin Smith, as he throws ridiculous sight gags at us in between the labyrinthine dialogue about Transformers, Star Wars, racial slurs, blogs, and life in general. Fans of Kevin Smith naturally will enjoy this movie and do not need to fear that he has "sold out." It's hard to say if newcomers will enjoy the movie. If they are into the humor of the movie, then they logically should already be aware of the first Clerks, as well as Dogma and Chasing Amy. I can only suggest for the moviegoer who is unaware of Kevin Smith's credentials to go rent Clerks. If the story bores you, then Clerks II probably won't appeal to you, though there are more sight gags that may appeal to some audiences. Those who are easily offended are also urged to stay away, as this movie contains scenes of profanity, bodily fluids, and (for most people) sexual deviance.All in all, it is a solid movie. It has a few pacing problems (or did at the screening) but nothing that negatively impacts the movie. Some scenes are utterly ridiculous, but it is par for the course for this type of movie.

Clerks 2 (2006): Dir: Kevin Smith / Cast: Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Rosario Dawson, Trevor Fehrman, Jennifer Schwallbach: Every bit as raunchy as the first film yet it contains that deep meaningful undercurrent that everyone can relate too whether or not one will admit it. Dante and Randall still work at Quik-Mart until it burns down in the film's opening. A year later they are employed at a fast food restaurant and still causing disgust with customers. Brian O'Halloran returns as Dante who is engaged and set to move to Florida in hopes of expanding his options. Jeff Anderson returns as the foul Randall who rents out a filthy sex exhibitionist as Dante's going away present, which turns out to be the film's grossest joke. Rosario Dawson plays the restaurant manager who actually loves Dante and given sudden news. Trevor Fehrman plays employee Elias whom Randall corrupts from his conservative upbringing of phony sexual myths. Jennifer Schwallbach plays Dante's imposing fiancée who dislikes Randall and encourages him to leave with her. Finally as trademark within Kevin Smith films is clever dialogue as well as the presences of Jay and Silent Bob loitering and dope peddling at the store front. Smith is seen as Silent Bob along with Jason Mewes as foul drug peddling Jay to underscore appreciation or normality of what is often taken for granted. Score: 8 / 10

In New Jersey, when Dante (Brian O'Halloran) arrives to open the convenience store "Quick Stop Groceries" for another labor day, he finds the place on fire. The losers Dante and his friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) find another job position in the fast food restaurant Mooby's, managed by Becky (Rosario Dawson), and working with the Christian employee Elias (Trevor Fehrman). The new and improved potheads and drug dealers Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) also move their traffic spot to the new location. Dante is planning a new life in Florida getting married with his fiancée Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach) while his friend Becky is a woman that does not believe in romantic love. On the eve of Dante's departure to Florida, Randal decides to promote a farewell and bachelor party to his best friend, and he invites Kelly and the Sexy Stud (Zak Knutson) from Tijuana to heat the celebration. However, things go wrong and Dante rethinks his future."Clerks II" is a hilarious sequel of the cult "Clerks" that was the debut of Kevin Smith. The story follows the usual politically incorrect style of this director, with racist and sexist jokes blended with drugs, gross situations and a romance. However, what else can a viewer expect from a Kevin Smith's movie? Rosario Dawson is extremely charming in the role of Becky, and the witty lines with double sense meanings are very funny. The conventional conclusion fits well to the story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Balconista 2" ("The Clerk 2")

I was lucky enough to go to an advanced screening of this film, a luxury not often afforded to us normal movie goers, and a luxury not appreciated by a critic that I don't need to name. This movie was filled with laughs, but still managed to tell a truly genuine story. A story about people that get trapped in their dead end jobs, and struggle to find happiness and try to decide what they want in life. Eventually teaching acceptance and promoting individualism rather than trying to live up to some kind of social standard.I was very impressed with the casting, everyone was great, and it was great to see some familiar faces, Afflec and Lee really left an impression even though they were only present in one scene each. Smith really presents a dramatic tone with his directing, a tone which is rarely set nowadays with most directors trying to match the style of Spielberg, Hitchcock, or (insert successful director here), and leave the movie looking like an impression, Smith isn't afraid to use his own style. Most movies today are very cookie cutter, but this is a refreshing change. What happened to directors just directing, instead of trying to follow a formula to get rich? Smith is a genuine and modest filmmaker, we can only hope that he keeps making movies, and maybe he'll inspire more "Hollywood" directors to stick to good/original material rather than weak big budget movies with all the latest young stars stinking up the screen. Cheers to Kevin Smith, cheers to Clerks II.9 / 10

I don't know what to say really, to me, both the original Clerks and the sequel are equally great.But I have to give props to the sequel more for the very simple fact it took the original premise and took it a little farther this time. What was once a convenience store is now a Burger Joint, and what was once a duo is now a trio, and what was once Black and White is now...color! There was B&W for the very first and last scenes though, but that's pretty much all.So yes, newcomer Trevor Fehrman as the lovable Elias adds great to the sequel. His love and affection for Lord of the Rings and Transformers can never get any better than that...well, I take that back. What's better than that is seeing the Star Wars loving Randal bash it to the ground, kick it, set it on fire, and spit on the ashes. Look out for everything else he spews out of his mouth, its all worth it.Jason as Jay once again is nothing less than awesome as well. Despite his recent heroin abuse act a few years back, he came back clean and better than ever. He's probably funnier than he was in any of the other View Askew movies, with Bob kicking it back and providing some real laugh out loud one liners. I wish him the best, cause as the great guy he is in real life, he deserves it.Dante, Becky, Emma, and everyone else (except for the Donkey Sacker) was just kinda in the background, unfortunately. While Kevin tried to do some of his "sentimental" moments in this movie to try not to make it a pure comedy, I just give him credit in trying. I thought the whole story was okay, it really had its moments (especially the Go Kart discussion and Randal's confession in the end, every girl in the theater were really tearing for the guy) but it was nothing more than that. The real show stealers for me were with the pessimistic Randal and the carefree Jay and Silent Bob, they really made the movie worth it and honestly they were the real reason why I wanted to see this anyway.And be honest, that's the real reason why you wanna see it too. Kevin Smith "tell it like it is" wit + Jay + Randal = Clerks. Especially Clerks II. Overall, worth the time and money. Especially for the Kevin Smith devotee and View Askew-phile. And definitely worth the purchase as soon as it hits DVD shelves.And yeah, Ben afflek and Jason Lee also make appearances too. Small but mildly effective.

Clerks II is a worthy successor to Kevin Smith's 1994 debut, "Clerks.".The continuing adventures of Dante and Randal speed along with witty dialogue, insightful social commentary, and a touching look at various levels of life, responsibility and most importantly, love.There's a lot of the requisite dirty jokes, but they enhance the golden center of the flick. I laughed and cried in many of the same moments. But mostly, I watched two characters I had grown up with grow up themselves and face some of the dilemmas I've faced since I went from being a teenage slacker to an adult. I was reminded of a better time in my life, and also reminded to look forward to the future.Brian O'Halloran knocks Dante out of the gate, with pitch-perfect delivery. I believe that this is still the Dante we knew - just a bit older. Jeff Anderson takes Randal, an already amazing character, and brings him to a new level. Randal becomes even funnier - and more touching. Trevor Fehrman's Elias adds the perfect foil for Randal's brand of mischief. Jay and Silent Bob, the dynamic duo, are also back - proving that Jason Mewes is back in top shape, and really enjoying making you laugh.~Steve

'Clerks 2' marks the much anticipated return of Dante and Randal to the big-screen. As two middle-aged underachievers coasting through life, they soon find themselves questioning where they're at.After having worked in a convenience store for ten years the duo are now flipping burgers at a diner in New Jersey. They pretty much hang out, debate the great issues of life and partake in conversations filled with explicit sexual references and derogatory slurs.Despite this, the dialogue is well scripted and engaging.Dante, played by Brian O' Halloran, faces a dilemma: does he marry the girl who promises him a fresh start to his miserable life or should he face the music of another tenuous situation in New Jersey. Naturally Randal is loath to see his best friend leave, and does everything in his power to dissuade him from moving to Florida.The film sports some much loved characters in Jay and Silent Bob and there is even a cameo appearance by Ben Affleck.Overall the film has performed well, given its modest budget of $5 million. To date it has generated some $27 million. Incidentally its predecessor, Clerks, was made on a meager budget of $27 000 and still managed to pull in $3 million. In a fashion befitting this cult-classic series, Clerks 2 delivers big on humour but low on content.

This movie was everything I hoped it would be. It is especially (or maybe even primarily) for fans of Kevin Smith's "ViewAskewniverse". (And yes, it's in color...mostly.) Also, there was no subtitle...it was titled simply "CLERKS II"...no "the second coming" or "the passion of the CLERKS".I don't want to hit any spoilers this soon before the movie comes out, but the general idea is that it is a "coming of age" story for the Gen X slackers, who finally in their 30s find themselves not having advanced very far in life, careers, personally or even in general (this is primarily Dante's role, anyway). He decides (due to some things beyond his control) to FINALLY move on, "grow up", get married and leave Leonardo New Jersey and its band of bad influences behind.Randall, of course, is not so keen at his only friend leaving NJ, is perfectly happy living with his parents and doing as little as possible, and a good part of the movie is spent on Randall challenging Dante's decision and exploration of their friendship.Now, this may sound like some kind of melodrama, BUT IT ISN'T!!! That basic story is weaved between the plot devices, smart dialogue and gritty or "pushing the limits" humor we come to expect from Kevin Smith.There's Jay and Silent Bob of course, who have a mini-character arc/growth experience themselves, Jason Lee in with an all new character for one short scene (I think this is his 5th new character in Kevin's ViewAskew franchise), and Ben Affleck with a mercifully brief (one or two line) cameo. Jay and Bob's antics are always a great break from the other action, never an intrusion, even when they are TRYING to intrude, by making asses of themselves (literally) in the background of the primary action.Plus, a couple of new characters, a crew member at Mooby's (a McDonald's type fast food joint) named Elias who is a very religious, naive counterpoint to Randall's ruthless and jaded personality, and therefore the butt of many jokes/gags. His and Randall's comments regarding "Lords of the Ring" vs "Star Wars" are priceless and vintage Kevin Smith.Another new character, "Becky", is played by Rosario Dawson, who is the manager at the same restaurant. She plays the part of the good female friend who depends on Dante and challenges Dante to consider if he really wants to settle for a girl who is merely tolerable.As with the first "CLERKS", this movie pushes the limit of what can be put on film and actually get released in theaters. I hope the more controversial parts make the final cut because I think the shock value that makes you say "NO THEY DIDN'T!" is a valuable part of the equation and expected from this film franchise. Without giving anything away, there are particularly two of the films ongoing jokes, one having to do with bestiality, the other in which some very NON-PC racial terms are used, REPEATEDLY, including the "N-word". No one else has the guts to address these issues and make them funny. 'Cept Kevin Smith.Finally, the movie really does have a story without being preachy, we're treated to known characters without it being a nostalgia-fest (for instance, Jay and Bob are in their signature places in front of the Quick Stop, but Jay utters not once "Snootchie Bootchies"...but not to fear, he finds a NEW way to crack us up...Bob's discovered a way to keep Jay's mind off of drugs. Fans of Jay will NOT be disappointed.)And the movie goes through an interesting story arc, with surprises and twists resulting in a satisfying ending.I'm concerned that the more risqué scenes might have to be neutered for ratings' purposes; hopefully not. If so, they will be on the DVD for sure. I can say that even in very conservative KC, the audience laughed A lot, no one walked out during the most "offensive" part, and everyone seemed to really enjoy the edgy wit, smart dialogue as well as the bathroom humor that kept the film at a fun pace.*EDIT-I've since read that 3 people walked out, which isn't bad from an audience of nearly 500 and with a movie this edgy. I guess I was enjoying myself too much to notice the walkouts!The movie is also more realistic than some of the other View Askew movies; more like Clerks, obviously. None of the comic book type stunts like in "Mallrats" (Silent Bob's batman utility belt and flying around with a cape) or "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" (with the fake lightsaber scenes and flying on the bicycle through a wall and not getting hurt) or all the special effects,mythology and divine interventions of "Dogma" (Alanis Morisette as God appearing at the end to save the world). There are no scenes to groan at and think "ah, right, like that could happen". These characters are real, and real things happen to them, no special abilities, creatures from the underworld or new age messiahs. Just real people that many of us can relate to.In closing...don't take your grandmother to this movie. It is full of obscene language, profane concepts, drug references, "unnatural" sexual references, etc. Unless you know your girlfriend is hip and not easily offended, test her with a DVD of "CLERKS" first to see if she "gets" the humor.Otherwise, get a gang of friends, go to this movie and get ready to laugh your freakin' BUTT off!

Most main-stream comedies would try to have over-the-top fantasy life premises, in which the audience can lance on, because how bizarre & surreal, it is. However, some of the better comedies, known for their Seinfeldian humor, idiosyncratic focus on more conversational everyday stuff that some audience might find mundane. Then, there are those, whom can mix, both of them, well-enough, that the audience can find, the simplest of premise, funny. This is one of those movies. Directed & written by Kevin Smith, Clerks 2 is a follow-up to the highest successful 1994's movie, Clerks and Smith's sixth feature film to be set in the View Askewniverse AKA Kevin Smith's fictional universe from the first film. Ten years after the events in Clerks, Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) & Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) find themselves working at a local fast food joint, after their previous work, Quick Stop Store, burned down, a year ago. Dante has plans to move away from town and get married, but Randal cannot yet, allow his long-last friend to leave, without one last goodbye party. While, Randal set up the party at the workplace, Dante is struggles with his mixed feelings for his current boss, manager, Becky Scott (Rosario Dawson) & his love for his fiancée, Emma Bunting (Jennifer Schwalbach). Will the goodbye party go according plan, or will Dante & Randal find themselves, making a bigger mess than before? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, it's nice to see Kevin Smith retackling his old films; however, in retrospect, it's generally viewed as Smith trying to rebound after his commercial failure in his non-View Askewniverse movie, 2004's Jersey Girl. Much like the original movie, the sequel to Clerks, also take place over the course of one day, and loosely connected with a series of small discussion skits and gags. But unlike, the first movie, the movie doesn't make too much jokes about the settling of the film. For a movie that mostly takes place at a fast food joint. I'm really surprised on the lack of jokes about junk food. You would think, the movie would be full of it. Anyways, the movie instead, tackles other issues, such as debates over movies, sexual positions, religion, racism, and romantic love versus pragmatic life choices. Like the first movie, the dialogue is rife with obscenities. Over 130 curse words, to start, as well as a lot of homosexual & racism slurs. The movie also has explicit jokes about bestiality, rape & others that some people might feel uncomfortable with. For me, the oddest thing about the film is having Jason Mewes as Jay do his 1991's the Silence of the Lambs, "Goodbye Horses" dance. That was really out of place & inappropriate. Even with all those, kinda offensive humor and jokes. There were some witty, somewhat heartfelt moments in the film. I did like the whole Jackson 5 'ABC" musical number. For the most part, all of these scenes serves mostly as filler. It really takes forever, for the weak main plot to kick in. The fact that the majority of that scene was ad-libbed, added to the pacing problems. While, the movie is not well-paced. The acting in this film was pretty good for the most part. The main actors, supporting actors, and cameos, all did their parts, very well. I have to say, my favorite actor in this, had to be Trevor Fehrman as Elias Grover, Dante and Randal's new co-worker at the Mooby's fast food chain. It sucks that he hasn't acted since this movie, because I found him to be, very funny. The worst acting in the film has to go to Jennifer Schwalbach. I'm really didn't buy anything, she was saying. Her performance was so wooden. Another thing, that was way different from the first movie, is how this sequel was in color & not in black & white. But as mentioned in the DVD commentary for this film, the entire film was desaturated, a bit after filming, because the colors were far too bright and cheery. In my opinion, I didn't mind that it was, as it adds so much to the cartoony astrosphere, giving the film a far, greater look. It reminds me, so much of the early 2000's animated TV Series Clerks with its style. Overall: While, Clerks 2 will never outshine the original. I have to say, it's still a watchable guilty pleasure of mine. Worth checking out. Face it tiger. You just hit the jackpot!

I've been lucky enough to see this movie twice, and I can't wait to see it again in theaters. I laughed so hard I NEED to see it again to hear what I missed the first two times around, and I even shed a tear or two.Kevin Smith is in fine form as Dante and Randal return 10 years older. But are they 10 years wiser? After the Quick Stop is unexpectedly shut down, Dante and Randall continue their meager existences at Mooby's, a fast food chain. The movie takes place on the day before Dante is set to leave for broader horizons with his overbearing fiancé, played by the stunning and impressive Jennifer Schwalbach.Can Dante really survive outside of the comfortable confines of New Jersey? What will Randal do without his hetero-lifemate? And speaking of hetero-lifemates, what are Jay and Silent Bob up to these days? Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson give stellar performances. Dante and Randal are back and in fine form. Trevor Fehrman is an excellent addition to the cast as Elias, new coworker and perfect whipping boy for Randal. I absolutely fell in love with Rosario Dawson as Becky, Mooby manager, several times over. Jay and Silent Bob pop in and out without disappointment. I can't tell you how fantastic it is to see Jason Mewes looking healthy and in top form.Those looking for the intelligent, wry and vulgar humor of Clerks will find it here. Can you top screwing a dead guy in a bathroom? Oh yes, you can! Those who appreciated the heart of Chasing Amy will find that here too. Only Kevin Smith can pull off that combination. The soundtrack is a must buy as well.I can't wait to see this movie again.

Look, I'll be honest with you. I think that Kevin Smith is the anti-Christ. His films in recent years have been dismal. I found Dogma to be one of the worst movies ever and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was made to appeal to the lucrative stoner/Generation X market who think that films like this are 'da bomb'. Sigh, I remember the days when people actually spoke correct English and we really need another World War to thin out their ranks a little. The aforementioned movies only make them believe it's funny to be hopeless losers that they are. It seems that Kevin Smith is incapable of writing a movie that isn't soaked in f-words or pee and fart jokes. Clerks II is NO exception, but he's reined in the stupidity and added enough real human drama to make it bearable for the rest of us.The store from the first movie has burnt down due to Randal's incompetence and he and Dante are forced to work in Mooby's, a Cow-themed fast-food restaurant with the lovely Becky (the utterly gorgeous Rosario Dawson, who I would do 86 ways) and Elias an ultra-Christian who seems to be an exaggerated cross between Rod AND Tod Flanders. I imagined the whole movie would be nothing more than them having inane conversations and swearing a lot while Jay and Silent Bob sell weed to the kiddies in the parking lot. And while we do get this there was, surprisingly, a bit of real story in there too.Dante is about to get married to a gorgeous woman who adores him (but only because she has given up on the shallow, good-looking men) and is leaving NJ forever the next day for sunny Florida. Despite the fact that their lives go nowhere, Randal really doesn't want him to go and would-be true-love Becky tries to convince him that he's fooling himself.It's the dilemma of finally being able to move on in life with a future of mock-happiness or making the most of what's right in front of you that elevates this higher than the crude JASBST and the wildly over-rated Dogma. But don't think for a minute that this film will not have extensive conversations on ass-to-mouth (Becky likes it!!!), comparisons of Star Wars to Lord of the Rings (or Nerd vs Nerd in other words) or arguments of non-racist racist words (Porchmonkey? Never heard of it!) or a man raping a donkey for the viewing pleasure of drunken idiots. And do look out for the 'Who's Your Buddy' Jesus on Jay's T-shirt.Although he does write some good scenes and his work in comic-books is brilliant (Bluntman and Chronic, read it!)I 'm still not convinced of Smith's ability as a director. One superficial and completely pointless dance number doesn't make up for the endless static shots of inside a fast-food joint, but at the very least it's slicker and more professional than Dogma, a film I will never forgive for its infinite rubbishness.

Clerks II:**** Clerks II is a strong and poignant retelling of the story of when two slackers grow into adulthood. In many ways this is writer/director Kevin Smith's most adult film in that we see four characters that we've grown up with over the past 12 years finally grow themselves. It opens on the final day of work for Dante who is finally getting up and out of Jersey with his fiancé, leaving Randal figuratively alone at Mooby's. Randal hasn't changed much over the past years, and in many cases neither has Dante. Randal still wrestles with the customers in pitiful pop culture debates, among them whether the LOTR trilogy is better than the Star Wars trilogy, but this time around he has a new foil in a 19 year old gamer-geek named Elias. The banter between these two is really funny especially when Randal tells him what he has planned for Dante's departure gift (but you'll have to see the flick to find out what that is because it is too gross for me even to write). After a short stint in re-hab Jay and Silent Bob have found solace in the Lord but this doesn't stop them from the dispensing with the drugs. Its odd to find that in the past decade it is Jay and Silent Bob that have changed the most, true they still are up to their perverse antics such as ass rubbing on the window and the disturbing recreation of "The Silence of the Lambs" dance but they have grown more sensitive to other people's emotions and needs, especially Jay. I haven't mentioned Rosario Dawson, who gives a very charming performance as the clerks' boss. She brings a lot of presence to a slightly underdeveloped character. But it is Jeff Anderson, Randal, that deserves the full attention this time around. He gives an award worthy performance and delivers it with an astonishing amount of sympathy. He's loosing his best friend which, though he'd never show it, absolutely devastates him. The last 20 minutes are really tear jerking, I know I was in tears and couldn't stop the flow. This film sort of keeps to the feel Smith created with Chasing Amy and Jersey Girl in that they lay the drama on thick and it almost works better than the comedy, an oddity for Smith proving he too has grown as a writer. It isn't all drama though you do get great comedic scenes such as, my favorite, the "porch monkey" scene. I nearly had laughing tears during it. This is probably Smith's best looking film elevating it to the quality one would get whilst watching a really good episode of television. The camera even moves! And a neat little digital effect is shown at the beginning where the clerks' world seamlessly transforms from black and white to color, I was shocked because I didn't even realize it was happening. This is one of Smith's best films and one of the year's best. I give it a high recommendation but I ask that you stick with it a little while because it moves at a slower pace then any of the other Jersey Chronicles, it may take a bit of getting used to for some, but this is a film that can not be missed.

A decade later, Dante and Randal still work at Quick Stop and RST Video, respectively. That is, until it burns down. Rather than moving on with their lives, the pair take up employment at another demeaning and degrading locale... the fast food restaurant.Shortly after this film's release, it was sitting as an 8.3 out of 10 on IMDb. That's a little bit high. Even now, at 7.8, it seems a stretch. I mean, I know you love Kevin Smith, but you know as well as I do this is not his best film.But nor is it his worst. This film hit me hard in the gut, made me sad. Because I finally felt I was saying goodbye to characters I grew up with. I've seen all the films opening day in the theater since 1995's "Mallrats" when I was 14, so almost half my life has been shared with these characters. They are my cinematic family. And after this one, I don't ever expect to see them again.See, the strength of this film is our connection to the characters. We have to identify with them. My generation, and especially my clique, knows what it's like to approach 30 and still be in a dead-end job or have no job, no family and no viable housing. We know what it's like to waste time and talk about nothing. Not that this is a good thing, but these are the truisms in Dante and Randal: we all need to grow up, but some of us do it in ways others will not.Not to say the film isn't funny. Granted, it's not as funny as "Clerks", "Chasing Amy" or "Mallrats". I see there being two periods in Smith's writing of humor, with these three being in the first period and all other films in the second. His drift from witty dialog to action sequences is his downfall. The references are stale (Transformers? Lord of the Rings?) and the dialog, Smith's best skill, is weak and thin. More conversation, less filler and this film would have been a masterpiece. But I appreciated the "Silence of the Lambs" jokes and other oddities. And I certainly liked the cameos being kept to a minimum -- the lack of "faces" is what made Clerks even better. Although Affleck is drifting back into obscurity, I think. Not unlike Steve Guttenberg.I felt that the jokes and references were forced. The parallels between this film and the first were nice, but again forced. I mean, the "not even supposed to be here today" line was not needed, though the Milk Maid shot was good. Attempts to make this a big movie left me feeling distant -- did we need so many hit songs? Do we need Dante driving around contemplating life? I don't know... not the film I would have wanted to see.If you like bestiality, smut talk, go-karts and some great racial slurs, this film is for you. If you don't, it's not. And if you never knew these characters before, you might want to acquaint yourself first. If you're going to be saying goodbye, you may as well say hello first.

I liked Clerks. It was funny and refreshing at the time. That was 1994. I had high hopes for Kevin Smith. Fast forward over a decade and that hope has vanished. Clerks 2 is utterly dreadful. This is absolutely pathetic film-making. Smith has never been much of a visual director; his films have always been slow and static. But now any flair for dialogue he ever had has gone. What you get are completely unlikable characters spouting foul-mouthed chunks of awful bile. None of it is funny or fresh. It all sounds like the stuff a desperate fanboy might come up with. And I guess that's all Kevin Smith is at heart. He should go and work in a video store where he might amuse the odd customer with a speech about Lord of the Rings. His career in film should be over.Contender for worst sequel of all time. A disgrace.

Staying faithful to everything that made its predecessor an instant classic, taking its graphic humour to a whole new level of extremity and exhibiting a significant upgrade in all aspects, Kevin Smith's follow-up to his 1994 debut feature is definitely one of the funniest, crudest & raunchiest comedies to surface on the silver screen yet carries a charm that most examples of its genre lack.Set 10 years after the events of the first film, Clerks II follows yet another day in the lives of Dante & Randal who, after the accidental incineration of their respective stores, now work at a fast food restaurant. Dante is about to leave his dead-end lifestyle to settle down in Florida with his girlfriend, Randal has a surprise going-away party planned for his best friend, and both Jay & Silent Bob are still around selling drugs.Written & directed by Kevin Smith, Clerks II is a huge improvement over Clerks that takes everything that was remarkable about the original and catapults it to a new high. The film is hilarious from its opening moments and it only gets better as the story progresses. Smith's direction also exhibits considerable enhancement in his handling of the coarse humour and thanks to its equally impressive storyline, it's his best film to date.The screenplay brims with welcome references to the original, explores an extensive range of profanities, parodies almost everything it comes across, and finishes on a high note with an inspiring, thoughtful & heartwarming ending that nicely explores the beauty of friendship. There is one sequence that throws in Star Wars vs Lord of the Rings argument, and despite being a devoted fan of the latter, it was impossible for me to not laugh like crazy while it was being mercilessly bashed.Even the technical aspects are brilliantly executed and are a step up from its predecessor which is to be expected given its higher budget. The camera bookends the film with black- n-white segments as a throwback to the original yet for the most part, its colour palette is effectively used. Editing is expertly carried out too for there isn't a single dull moment in the picture and its 97 minutes of story simply flies by. And also worthy of a mention is its excellent choice of songs that compliment the narrative.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of the same guys who were present in the previous chapter with most notable new addition being Rosario Dawson, who plays the manager of the fast food restaurant. The chemistry between Dante & Randal is as amazing as before and same goes for Jay & Silent Bob who are allotted more screen time here. The entire cast chips in with valuable inputs in their given roles and even though the performances aren't by any means outstanding, it's good enough to stay away from the complaint zone.On an overall scale, Clerks II is an ideal sequel to Clerks that has to go down in my book as one of the most rib-tickling, unabashedly funny & endlessly fascinating comedies I've ever seen. It has the unparalleled humour of South Park, the characters are as idiosyncratic as I expected, and even its dramatic segments carry a certain amount of depth & happen to be as rewarding as its moments of comedy. Highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying, Clerks II comes one hundred percent recommended for there is nothing about this genre masterpiece that I don't like.

Filmmaker Kevin Smith returns to the stamping ground of his breakthrough independent film of 1994, with rather ingratiating, if imperfect, results. Dante (Brian O'Halloran) shows up for work one day to find the Quick Stop in flames. The next chapter of his life sees him and Randal (Jeff Anderson) working for the fast food joint "Mooby's"; however, there exists a chance for Dante to escape a dead-end life by marrying his girlfriend (played by Smiths' real-life wife, Jennifer Schwalbach) and moving to Florida.There's the expected barrage of raunchy humour and vulgarities, but Smith still manages to come up with some priceless lines. His main problem is with the pacing, as some scenes really go on too long. And what's with that production number set to the Jackson Five? Anyway, the film ultimately emerges as pretty engaging, especially for any loyal Kevin Smith fan; there are some choice cameos by actors from the Smith filmography. But what's key to really making "Clerks II" work is its portrayal of the Dante / Randal friendship, which comes to a head in the third act, and some fairly poignant dialogue. The story *does* have some real heart.The Randal character runs the risk of wearing out his welcome, but it's still amusing the way that this terminally immature, irresponsible character operates without a filter and says whatever he damn well pleases. He has a slew of sardonic comments for just about any occasion. (Although, along those lines, some of this viewers' favourite moments occur when Randal has *no* witty comeback to something someone else has said.)The cast is just fine, with Dante as the perennial straight man and Randal as the irreverent one. Rosario Dawson is a delight as the "Mooby's" boss with whom Dante has forged another strong relationship; she and O'Halloran have great chemistry. Jason Mewes and Smith himself are still funny as shameless slackers Jay and Silent Bob (indulging in enough "Goodbye, Horses" gags for two movies). Trevor Fehrman is amusing as dorky "Mooby's" co-worker Elias.There is an over-reliance on "nerd"-based humour, as the "Lord of the Rings" and "Transformers" stuff is dragged out too much. But Smith wraps things up with such an appealing conclusion that he still generates plenty of good vibes. At the end, there is a nice message about taking control of ones' life.Seven out of 10.

You'll like Clerks 2. If you liked the original Clerks, this is Kevin's Smith's masterpiece. It mirrors the original Clerks, but it shows how much he's grown as a writer and a director. From the black and white/color shots, to the crane shot (a *beep* crane shot), to just the placement of people in the Camera shots...everyone one of these things contributed to the overall enjoyment of this movie.The script is crisp and tense, with just the right amount of reality and joy. There is no long monologues or actors stumbling over lines. There's this freedom in Smith's work that doesn't feel forced or attempting to impress anyone...but he impresses everyone with just the beautiful way of putting together his scenes.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, but especially those who are on the verge of 30 and the rest of your life. It definitely impressed me and touched me in a way that I didn't expect. It's a fitting end to the Jersey Viewaskewverse.Hopefully, in 10 years, they do another Clerks movie. I'd love to see these guys in their 40s. Randal and Dante are the most engaging of couples and Smith writes such an engaging story about friends in their 30s without pandering or compromising the vision of their piece.You will love it. Even if you hated all his other movies past Clerks, you will love it.

Brain O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes, Rosario Dawson, Kevin Smith, Trevor Fehrman and Jeniffer Schwalbach. (Cameos by: Ethan Suplee, Jason Lee, Ben Affleck). Directed by Kevin Smith. After 12 years and many films, Kevin Smith returns with his rude, crude and brass sense of humor with the obscene clerks. After a fire burns down the Quick Stop Dante (O'Halloran) and Randal (Anderson, in an Oscar worthy role, I know right) are forced to enter the world of a fictional Disney like restaurant Mooby's. Where the duo do the same thing in the job, make fun of customers and a geeky LOTR fan Elias (Fehrman). While Dante is in the mist of a life crisis and has to make the decision of whether to leave his pal Randal forever. And the return of the new and improved Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), not to mention a lovely credit to Levine's "Tuck" Dance from "Silence of the Lambs", creepy in full form. "Clerks 2" is a nice return to the counter culture world, that does ring true. Smith truly has an ingenious sense of humor and also throws in a few dramatic notes in the end, kudos to Anderson on the tidy delivery. The funniest movie I've seen since the "40 Year Old Virgin"

You don't see the words excellent sequel together very often but this film lives up to them. I have not laughed out loud in a movie in a very long time. I almost couldn't catch my breath from laughing so hard. This movie is just awesome. Kudos Mr. Smith and crew. Every part of this movie is worth watching from the opening credits to the very last frame of the film. Kevin Smith plays to the fans of his films and we appreciate every last bit of it. We are rabid and loyal and this film does not disappoint. At the theatre I watched it in the entire audience cheered when it began and were clapping and cheering at the end. I could have watched it again immediately.

Thank you Kevin Smith, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. I am so glad that I saw Clerks 2 while here in Sacramento for training. I saw it alone of course and could not stop being entranced! There were tons of gross parts which is EXCELLENT!!! Jay and Silent BOB were excellent as always. Of course, Dante and his friend contemplate life like CRAZY, especially the other guy. The argument about Lord of the Rings vs. The Star Wars trilogy had me DYING OF LAUGHTER!!!! This movie will be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I am glad I saw this. Keem em' coming Kevin Smith because you are a genius.The end

Wow, the return of the clerks, indeed! I went to a pre-screening last night of Clerks II and let me say that it was actually really good. The title, as Mr. Smith explained, has been simplified to undersell the movie so fans and moviegoers in general will be pleasantly surprised when they see it. So here is my contribution to word-of-mouth advertising: if you liked ANYTHING about Clerks I, go see Clerks II. More of the same and then some; and then some more. I have always been hit-or-miss with Kevin Smith and, sadly, the original Clerks was still my favorite of the group. And this movie is his best yet.(In fact, the only way I can appreciate "Mallrats" is to watch it with the audio commentary on.) To me, Mr. Smith is a lot funnier when he's just add-libbing. He said during his Q & A, last night, that they spent more time on this movie in pre-production than all the other movies combined and it shows. I am sure he was kidding but this movie is actually well written, very well acted (Rosario especially; she is the topping that is going to make this movie sell), and just well thought out in general. Good pacing (especially with the sight gags, one after another) and the Decalogue that I've come to appreciate is priceless. Like the argument over which franchise has the better "Return" movie; "Lord of the Rings" or "Star Wars". Clerks II has become my favorite movie of the summer and I hope it becomes the sleeper hit of the summer because it is just that good. Oh, and Kevin, if you're reading this, sorry about the title, I am sure you pondered it. Maybe if you hadn't already used "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"?

When the film Hannibal was green lit for the always much anticipated sequel to Silence of the Lambs, it seemed odd for so much time had passed since Silence, past its prime and out of time. Twevle years has past since the original Clerks became an indie smash, and now a cult film. In those twelve years, protagonists Randal and Dante haven't change. In a nostalgic opening sequence of black and white, the Quick Stop burns down, with Dante and Randal, and delinquents Jay and Silent Bob needing to move on. Yet moving from one pathetic job to the next doesn't help.Becoming employed at fast food restaurant Mooby's; seen through Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Dante has finally taken a step to change his life; engaged to Emma and moving to Florida. It's his last day at Mooby's and waits the rest of his life. Randal hasn't changed, abusing customers and co-worker Elias. They still argue about important things, life, sex, ones sexuality, nothing is sacred.Kevin Smith has a knack for writing highly pretentious material. Much like Cameron Crowe, Smith acts like he knows some secret about life and love that we aren't getting. Though to his credit, he makes it works and his films are engagingly entertaining. His other knack is mixing in obscene amounts of crude, toilet humor, inducing hysterical comedy, especially from Jay and Silent Bob. Though Smith seems to have lost some of his bite.Clerks had this freshness to it, exploring work, love and friendship. Chashing Amy put a spin on the boundaries of love, Dogma was a sinful piece of satire on religion. Clerks II sounds like a broken record. It retreads over past conversations and arguments we've heard to much; Lord of the Ring vs Star Wars is getting boring, the subtext of LOTR is gay has been spewed forth so many times. It all seems stale.There is a lot we've heard before in this tale, but Smith does keep things running along with the jokes coming in rapid fire; digging deeper into scat humour and the boundaries of tasteful erotica. Pillow Pants and Jay's homage to Silence of the Lambs is side splitting. Smith also gets his usual cameos from Ben Affleck and Jason Lee.Brian O'Halloran made Dante in Clerks a great pathetic character, feeling for his plights. Here he's just pathetic, O'Halloran just makes him so uninteresting. Jeff Anderson hasn't missed a step for Randal, not missing a note during any of his arguments. Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith know their characters inside out, always picking up the slack when things go down. Trevor Fehrman is perfect as Elias, with a different take on the nerd character. Rosario Dawson is the best of all, she's a really talented actress.Clerks II misses that spark of the original, but is a must for all the fans.

I saw an early screening of C2 and I must say that the flick is way better than anyone thought it would be. Mr. Smith is back in prime form and I would dare to say that this is quite possibly his best work yet. Granted, this is not a film for everyone but, if you are not offended by purposefully vulgar humor, C2 should be on your "must see" list. Dante (Brian O' Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) are back with their humorous banter as if a whole decade had not gone by since we saw them last. Dante/Brian is practically flawless as the straight man while Randal/Jeff is one of the funniest actors around and their on-screen chemistry is simply wonderful. The new guy Elias (Trevor Fuhrman from "Now You Know") is a clever addition to the group while Rosario Dawson shines her irresistible charm on this little world of dysfunctional employees. The combination is a winning one and, if you add an healthy dose of Jay and Silent Bob to the mix, and even a musical number worthy of "The Blues Brothers", you have quite possibly the best comedy of the summer. This film is enjoyable even if you are not familiar with the original Clerks, but it's even better if you are. To top it all off, Kevin Smith shows us that he has learned from his mistakes and has now mastered the fine art of balancing comedy with truly heartfelt moments, staying clear of the sappiness that sunk "Jersey Girl". At the end of the film there were quite a few shiny eyes in the audience... bravo Mr Smith! You pulled off your best trick yet.

What I like about Kevin Smith is that he doesn't shy away from anything risqué. Bestiality, racial epithets, dick and fart jokes....the list goes on. What I can't believe is that he still keeps coming back to the same old territory. I saw this in the theatre and I did laugh out loud (yes I LOL'ed) but I left wondering what Kevin will do next. I saw the original Clerks back in '94 when all the rage was beating down my door. No intentional rhyme there. I loved it, just like I loved Mallrats and Chasing Amy to follow. But then came Dogma. Then Jay & SIlent Bob Strike Back....then that other one with Affleck & Tyler that I still can't bring myself to view. It was nice to see Dante and Randal trot about in their usual jerky way for my enjoyment. However, I did wonder if the counter-jockeys will come back when they're pushing 60 for Clerks 3 : The Golden Years. I figure it will take place in a convalescent home with a hot nurse teasing their aged tender vittles while they bicker about their failed lives. I just hope that Mr. Smith can come back with something besides Jay & Silent Boob. I was tired of it a few movies back. Yet i still find myself checking these movies out. I guess I still am a Kevin Smith fan. I also like cookies....especially ones with chocolate....a little bit of macadamia doesn't hurt either.

Yep. Although he seems like a nice enough guy to grab a beer with and shoot the gab. Unfortunately he can't write dialogue and I'm tired of the same tired old clichés and flat jokes he trots out every two or three years to keep his mouth-breathing perpetually pubescent fanbase satisfied. Was I expecting an enlightening experience from Clerks II? Of course not. But I was expecting a few laughs, and I didn't get them. A couple of chuckles here and there, but nothing I wouldn't get from listening to drunks outside my window on a Friday night. And that's unscripted and free of charge.Atom Egoyan is often nailed by critics for overusing his questionably talented wife in lead roles, but he's got nothing on Smith. Good lord. Having to watch Emma and Dante make out stands as one of the most unpleasant things I've ever had to bear witness to. The "boob" flash was the runny icing on the dried out cake. I had to stop the movie and check the IMDb to see who she was and how on earth she was cast as Rosario Dawson's competition. Not much of a contest. I mean, fair enough, it's admirable that Smith is looking out for the love of his life, but damn. A hint of verisimilitude couldn't hurt could it? Rosario Dawson vs. Veiny Cokehead Anorexic Washed-Up-Porn-Starlet looking girl doesn't really come off as a fair fight. But I'm being mean. Sorry. But in all seriousness, get that woman some friggin protein. For the love of god.So yeah, I didn't like the movie. But who cares, right? Kevin Smith's legions of fanboys will keep him warm and safe at night, and are most likely yelling "EFF OFF!" and "LIKE YOU COULD DO ANY BETTER!" at the computer screen as they read this.Hopefully he'll retire from film-making and concentrate on blogging.
