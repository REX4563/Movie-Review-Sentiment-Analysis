This was not the perfect movie, but it was also leagues better than most contemporary horror movies. I wanted to discuss the positives and negatives in my review but then also address common complaints from other reviews and forums.The absolute best part of the movie (many of the detractors even give this credit) was a detailed look into Jigsaw's past and his twisted motivations. The traps were decent - I think too many people romanticized the traps of the first Saw when many of the new ones relied on the exact same cringe factor that made the first movie so effective. I feel that in order to appreciate Saw II, you really have to approach the subject in a similar matter to Jigsaw. Sure, the situations in the movie were not scary like "Hellraiser" scary. Instead, if you look at it more like a psychological experiment, the true dark genius of the movie comes out. What would happen if eight people awoke in a room, their lives in danger, and no certain way to save them? We see immediately all of these very distinct personalities working together or against each other. Despite best intentions, there's always going to be some violent ass like Xavier that ruins even the most well laid plans. Thus, even "capable" humans are brought down by the defects of those around them.The drawbacks - there was no single scene that was comparable in terms of tension to the "Adam camera" scene from Saw. Also, at 93 minutes, I felt like some of the characters (Laura, Gus, Addison) never got a chance to be developed. It would have been great to have seen their traps explained or heard their back stories. However, this can be explained by reference to the plot. As a cohesive group, the hostages were a failure. Who knows how vividly the characters could have been described if they had opened Xavier's door or worked together better? But if they had been successful, more of them would have gotten the antidotes and there would have been less urgency all around. So it seems like some characters had to be sacrificed to keep the movie going.I've noticed a lot of people expressing incredulity at some of the logic in the movie and it's been bothering me for two reasons. First of all, I know plenty of people who are willing to suspend disbelief for some stupid action flick, but not for a horror movie. This doesn't necessarily describe the exact people writing reviews - my point is only that horror should probably given more slack than other types of movies. Second of all, a lot of the "illogical" reactions are not all that crazy when you think about them.For instance, why did Xavier cut the number off of his neck instead of asking politely? Lots of people found this unrealistic simply because they CLAIM that they wouldn't do that. Well, it made perfect sense for the character who had been established as a heartless egomaniac up until that point. Also, let's not forget that there's only 1 antidote in the safe. If you have ONLY 15 minutes to live and have reason to believe that others will screw you over if you cooperate, you'd do something drastic too.Others claim that there's no way Amanda would go over to the "dark side" once having run through Jigsaw's gauntlet, herself. Again, this is not all that unbelievable. Psychologists have noted the phenomenon of Stockholm Syndrome, in which hostages come to identify with and even join their captors (Patty Hearst). Likewise, in abusive families, children who suffer psychological or physical abuse don't ALWAYS repeat this cycle, but they are much more likely to than the general population. I found Amanda the scariest part of the movie, not because Shawnee Smith can match the creepy gravitas of Tobin Bell (she can't), but the sheer notion of her transformation. Jigsaw, while not physically powerful has the ability to reproduce his twisted world view in formerly sane people, including the ones he's "tested." Shawnee is not capable of delivering the "game over" line like Tobin can, but the thought that the idea of Jigsaw won't die even when he's physically dead is truly one of the more disturbing aspects of the movie.

Saw II follows on the heels of Saw, as another taught, tense thriller. The mark of a great thriller/shocker/horror movie is the number of twists and turns, and this is what identifies Saw II as one of the better members of its genre.This is NOT a movie where people walk backwards into dark rooms. This is NOT a movie where people pull sheets off bodies. That's all too predictable for Saw II. In fact, there's virtually nowhere in this film, where you can say that you've got it figured out.Few movies keep me on the edge of my seat. This was one of them. There was no one dozing off during this flick. And the number of folks who walked out to take/make cell phone calls was the lowest I've ever seen.Like Saw, this sequel is more than a little bloody in some places, but that's to be understood. It was never promoted as a walk in the park. If you're in the mood for a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is worth a try.And this movie left more than a few folks in the audience waiting for another sequel.

I have no idea what my title means, except that it sounded clever in my head. Hmm.I'll assume that you've already seen the original Saw and you're wondering if this is a worthy successor. In a word: yeah. But it's a very different approach. While the first Saw was brilliantly minimalistic, the story being staged almost entirely in one room, this second installment takes us out of the box. Gone is the claustrophobic feeling of confusion and good ole existentialistic "who am I" from the original, and instead we get more of a mystery as seen from the outside, as our hero Eric (Donnie Wahlberg) tries to crack the case before it's too late.Sure, the same elements existed in the first film, with 2 concurrent plots of victim & detective. But the draw of the first was to figure out why all these things are happening. Here the mystery is revealed in the first few minutes, the killer is apprehended, and what follows is a sort of chess game between investigator Eric and perp Jigsaw with the clock ticking to save the intended victims. It's actually a clever approach similar to the rather AWESOME film "Exorcist III" (1990) which is composed of dark dialogues between the detective and the lunatic, and this dramatic approach was repeated a year later in the more popular "Silence of the Lambs" (1991). But in this domain, in order for it to work, the film must be slow, almost painfully slow, thick and heavy.Saw II attempts to balance the heavy, psychological "Lambs" approach with good old fashioned slashes & gore. It succeeds, I feel. But I still can't help but wonder how it would've been if the filmmakers had gone full tilt "Lambs" on us. Instead the dialogues between Eric & Jigsaw seem a bit short, rushed and not fully explored.The result is a film which is certainly entertaining, but I don't think it will ever be considered a psychological classic like the other two I mentioned, or like "Seven"--films that are much slower in pace, with far fewer gallons of blood spilled but with oceans of drama.I know this may sound like a negative review, but that's only because I'm comparing Saw II to the heavyweights. If instead we take Saw II at face value, a straightforward horror flick, it certainly delivers. There's the added bonus of having two nice twists at the end. In terms of sheer entertainment value, Saw II cuts a real log.I should really quit trying to come up with witty puns.

I have the same main problem I had with Saw II that I had with the original (Shockingly enough, not the gaping plot holes). At the core, both movies are about the same thing: Elaborate puzzles that stupid people ignore so they can spend more time yelling at each other.I really wanted to like Saw II, but I felt like I was being teased. I catch a whiff of interesting puzzle-solving, instead I have a lot of yelling.It's a personal preference, I know. The movie I wanted to see was about people adapting to their situation and using their brains against that of an evil genius. Instead, I got the evil genius (Tobin Bell is great as Jigsaw, by the way, one of the parts of the film I really enjoyed) going to a lot of work for some people who, frankly, don't seem to appreciate it. The creators seemed to want to make a film about how people's lives are dictated by their unavoidable flaws (driven home by the ending, the last few twists, and the general character of the cop, all of which are the reason my rating is as high as it is), and how panic destroys people.And the horror... isn't. I don't find blood scary. There are some *shocking* moments in this film, some cringe-inducing moments, but nothing actually scary. That really disappointed me, because Adam's capture in Saw I was one of the scarier scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time. There's nothing for people who actually want to be scared here, just grossed out.

Last night we were part of the lucky few(750 peoples) who got to see the world premiere to the public of Saw II. Without going too much into the details, for this kind of movie can be ruined quite easily by revealing to much, I can say that it was a good sequel albeit not as strong as the first one. I could compare quite easily having seen the first one the night before.First of all the character development, one of the greatest strength in the first one, is quasi inexistent in the sequel. This of course could be explain by the fact that having 8 characters locked together instead of only 2 gives less room for each one of them. Even if I liked the concept of having a bunch of people trapped, there could have been a way to remove some character and give a little more room to the background of the more important ones. This actually lead to a feeling of watching a more americanized version of saw. You actually loses a part of the psychology that was also very strong in the first one. This loss i could say is partly due to the fact that you again haver very little to base yourself on the background of the characters.Despite all of this it was entertaining. Most of the jigsaw's game of the sequel still have the same flavor as those in the original and the plot line in itself is still very good as you get to understand a little more behind the games of jigsaw. I recommend for all of you to watch it once its out in theater but don't go expecting the same feeling you had when watching Saw, you'll be disappointed.

A few unfortunates people(Glenn Plummer,Enmanuel Vaugier,Beverly Mitchell,Erik Knudsen, among others) trapped into closed building and they must encounter a way out before inhale a lethal nerve gas. But they must also avoid the deadly traps Jigsaw(Tobin Bell) has set on the way. Meanwhile, a policemen(Donnie Wahlberg,Dina Meyer) and SWAT track down from him. Jigsaw, who is on the brink of death , has become obsessed for revenge and has prepared twisted traps. The group must race against the clock of Jigsaw's on ticket heart affected by cancer.This second sequel from original by James Wan, packs grisly terror, tension, suspense and lots of blood and gore . The film takes accent as suspense as well as terror with creepy use of images- shock and slick edition. Provides an imaginative and well-knit screenplay plenty of twists and surprises . Sinister and mysterious atmosphere , well made by cameraman David Armstrong and eerie musical score adequate for mystery and tension by Charlie Clousier. The movie is again starred by Tobin Bell, he's a secondary actor working from the 80s in TV series(Walker Texas Rager, Stargate SG1, Alias, 24) and occasionally for cinema(Goodfellas, The firm, Ruby, Black mask 2), achieving success with Jigsaw character. The motion picture is well directed by Darren Lynn Bousman. It's followed by Saw III by same director and with Dina Meyer, Shawnee Smith and Costas Mandylor; Saw IV again with Donnie Wahlberg, Dina Meyer and in pre-production, Saw V directed by David Hacklin with Costas Mandylor.

Saw 2 is a better than average movie with a promising storyline that just didn't turn out as good as it seemed.I did enjoy the dialog between Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bell,but the scenes with everyone stuck in the booty trapped room set up by Jigsaw was terrible,the dialog and acting was very mediocre and it mostly relied on gore.It is definitely more gory than the first Saw,a bit too gory for me,the way everyone is killed is just disgusting and graphic.The movie also wasn't as frightening as the first Saw and the story didn't have a build up as exciting as the original.I also didn't like how we didn't get to see much of the Jigsaw puppet and the direction isn't as dark (the director is different) as the first.Saw 2 is very gruesome,but its not very scary,if your a fan of the first you should still check it out,mainly because of Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bells impressive performances and a very unexpected twist,but you will be overall disappointed.The Jigsaw Killer has kidnapped the son of cop Eric Matthews.Jigsaw gets Eric to talk to him while his son and many others try to survive.

Shame, shame, shame. I actually enjoyed the first Saw quite a bit, and had hopes that this installment would meet or surpass its predecessor in quality. Poor guess on my part. I am a huge fan of horror movies...I have been watching them since I was a child. This was no horror movie. It was a poorly put-together "psychological" thriller with some violence in it. Part of what made the first movie good was the anonymous evil-doer. Having Jigsaw out and front all the time just didn't do it for me. The movie tries to justify his motivations, but his diatribes into the human condition fall short of convincing me. Fear of the unknown is one of the strongest types of fear there is, and having the killer spell out all his intentions is really kind of a let down. Also, the twist just left me snoring. And another thing (whine whine whine) was that I just could not suspend my disbelief. So there is this terminal cancer patient who can barely walk, yet is able to put many large sturdy devices together. Sure, he has help, but look at all the gear setup, and you'll see what I'm getting at. Also, Jigsaw must be psychic. His big ransom is the son of the detective. So he sets up all these traps in order to reach a desired outcome. What if people dropped dead from the nerve gas early? What if one of the criminals flipped out and killed the boy early? Sure, he might have profiled them, but I had some of these same issues with Mindhunters. The kicker is that I just don't care about any of the characters in this movie. They're all jerks, and it doesn't pain me to see them die. The end. Don't see this movie, it is a waste of time.

This movie has just mad a quantum leap in horror films. after watching this movie i had the chills walking to my car, and lets say that i more than enjoy a scary movie. this movie kept me up for at least and hour after watching it. it was one of those movies were you cant let it out of your mind. The movie had one of the best openings that i have seen in a long time. after a few minutes into the movie i had to put down my popcorn. i don't have a weak stomach and this movie got me to put down my popcorn, that is huge. With a great blend of suspense, acting, and oh yes there was a lot of blood. this movie great deserves another watch, i would pay to see this movie a couple of times. not to mention one of the best twists i have seen in a movie. i would say 2nd best ending i have seen in a movie.(#1 was Fight Club). you definitely have to see this movie.

OK, if you've already seen the first one, you will be absolutely disappointed. it in no way lives up to the first one at all. first of all, saw was great because it was two kids on a low budget writing a script. they had to make up for the lack of money with the plot and script. secondly, the plot was really good and thick and everyone was connected in some odd way. the ending had so many twists, it was just brilliant. OK, now for saw 2. they had more money, so they definitely used it. instead of the people being in one room, it was one huge house. having more money took away from the effect, and most definitely the script, the plot and the acting. the plot had an unbelievable amount of holes in it. the people were connected by one stupid little line and the ending was absolutely ridiculous. one of the characters is just a complete idiot and decides to just get mad about everything. so, when he finds out there are numbers on the back of people's necks, instead of just kindly asking them to turn around, he kills them! finally, someone points out that he has a number on the back of his head that he's going to need, so he can't kill everyone. first of all, he tries seeing it with his little knife, then he decides to just cut it off, as any logical person would do. then, the murderer, john some how came up with a lot of money between dr gordon and now. before hand, his technique was simple. the tools he used to murder people could be found at a yardsale. in this one, somehow he got surgical equipment, the brains to do surgery and about five places with 20 computers. at some point in time, the writers seemed to have decided that it didn't matter that he had cancer, he can still do all this stuff. however, when you see him, he's in pretty bad shape. OK, now for the ending. remember the changed druggy, amanda? well, apparently, after she was almost killed, she decided the entire idea was a good one. so, she comes to john as an apprentice and decides to take his place as jigsaw. john becomes her yoda and teaches her the way of murder. at the end of saw 1, john had the memorable line of "GAME OVER". it was so great because of his voice, his appearance, everything. at the end of saw 2, amanda comes in, looking like she just went shopping and got her hair done and put on make up, and in a very little girl voice says "game over". absolutely horrible.

Jigsaw kidnaps a few unsuspecting 'criminals' along with the son of a detective. Having been unappreciative of their lives, the dying Jigsaw challenges the hostages to escape the house they are held in. The victims have two hours to find antidotes in order to escape a virus with which they are infected, involving deadly tasks and booby traps, as well as negotiating differences with their fellow-captives. Meanwhile Detective Matthews seeks to find where his son is being held through interrogating Jigsaw, the true colours of the cop coming out through the course of the film.Mixed within the depth of violence and suspense of the film lies juxtaposed moralistic messages and a superb plot that is increasingly rare in the genre in modern times. However, for some, the violence may be too much, indeed the processes of killing the subjects are ingenious but not in any way subtle. However, if you're going to watch Saw II, then it's unlikely that your shy of horror, and you'll get it in bucket-loads, as well as a twist at the end that is as good as any you'll see in cinemas today.Overall as a film Saw II is very good, it's entertaining, thou such a strong plot may have benefited from not seeming to want to rely so heavily on graphic violence. It probably won't go down as a classic and it's certainly not for everyone (don't rent it for the kids one night), but it's certainly one of the better 'scary' movies of recent times and worthy of a trip to the cinema or DVD store.

Saw was already a movie with a deep, terrific plot. The sequel contained the same, although it just isn't as great as the first one. First off, there are much more people locked inside the trap. Therefore, if one gets angry or upset, they can kill each other, like Xavier did. Chaos and fights will start between people, unlike the first one where there were only an amount of two, so if one dies the other one will most likely go too. Torture scenes were just as brutal and left you with eyes opened wide enough to make your eyes dry up. Such as Amanda jumping into a pool of syringes, Obi being cooked up in an oven.Parts of the movie weren't as confusing and mind boggling anymore. I understand that "The Devil May help You" for Obi, but it's kind of obvious. Also, the first one tells the story of each person and WHY they are in the trap and HOW they aren't appreciating their lives. This one only explains probably one or two.I'd give props to the ending, because it was just a complete shock to me. I couldn't believe the fact that Amanda was faking the whole time and how she was actually helping Jigsaw, and that the surveillance camera was set 2 hours back already. As Jigsaw said, if Eric Matthews would have listened, his son is SAFE. Instead, he didn't listen, and he ended up dead, when his son was in a safe next to him.Overall, this movie was pretty good, just wasn't AS good as the first one. I would watch it again, but it wouldn't give me much interest after a while since it's pretty shady and dull.

The first Saw really through me through some spins and caught me off guard for originality, Saw 2 is leagues above the first. Saw 2 runs with the same game based theme as the first, with clues for both the characters and the audience about what might happen next, but it takes the game to a completely different level. Just when things start to come together there is another twist to leave the viewer on the edge of their seat for what may come next. Without seeming to give everything away the movie was made to give it all away, but no one can catch all the clues because they have been pulled so deep into the movie. I highly recommend this one.

Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the methodical serial killer from Saw, is back! This time, he's pitted against a tough detective (Donnie Wahlberg), who must try to save his son and others from a house of horrors filled with deadly nerve gas, puzzles and death traps.Saw 2 is just as scary and suspenseful as the original. The death traps are very creative and some of the twists are unpredictable. The original Saw was a very suspenseful film that actually terrified its audience. The sequel is more or less the same except its much bloodier. Whether or not that's a good thing is entirely up to you but it was fine by me. There were more scary, over the top gory scenes in this film then in the original Saw. There were more characters as well and that kind of hurt the film since they were all one dimensional. Some of them didn't even share their story of why they were there. The acting was well not so good. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who has seen the original film.Tobin Bell probably gives the best performance as Jigsaw. This guy is defiantly very scary and very creepy. You see a lot more of him this time around so it made the film better. Donnie Wahlberg plays the detective who is trying to hunt down the people being tortured. He does a decent job though nothing special. Shawnee Smith plays Amanda and she also gives a decent performance. Everyone else was either too over the top or under performed. The worst was Beverley Mitchell but she's from 7th Heaven so that shouldn't be too much of a surprise. James Wan didn't direct this one and it shows. The original relied more on suspense to scare its audience while this one focuses more on disturbing scenes. There were disturbing scenes in Saw but that wasn't what the film was really about. So, the director for Saw 2 isn't as good as Wan. Also, the film is too short so the story feels rushed and its not as effective as it could have been. Like the original, it's hard to feel sorry for the characters because they do bad things and are so unlikable but that's just me. In the end, Saw 2 is a very gory and violent sequel that lives up to the original. Rating 8/10.

The tag line says it all: Oh yes, there will be blood!I've had the chance/honor of seeing the sequel of a very anticipated movie this year at the world's premiere at the Montreal's Midnight Madness and I haven't been disappointed one bit. Off course, there was some magic that night, considering the fact that there were hundreds of horror fans expecting a gory sequel to the Saw installment and they got served! Without stating any spoilers, let me confirm that the movie is packed with bloody action and gore at its best. Those who liked the Jigsaw's strategy of allowing him the chance of survival to its victims by giving them a puzzle to solve, this time it goes even further. From the start until the end, you'll be given puzzling situation in which you wouldn't like to be part of at any time in your life. Near the end of the movie, the twisted game gets even more spicy...I wasn't used to hear people applauding at the theater and it created some kind of psycho ambiance in the room that I kinda really enjoyed. The sadistic approach of the Jigsaw killer is still pretty impressive! Without telling you more, go watch it with some friends that will be able to tolerate blood in gallons and you'll be served! I give it a 9/10 for its originality, gory moments, interesting story and punch of action. It is rare to see a sequel that beats its predecessor but in this case, it does!

While investigating the bloody aftermath of a grizzly murder, Detective Eric Matthews has the feeling that it is the work of Jigsaw, the notorious killer who disappeared leaving a trail of bodies behind. Jigsaw is indeed back, but instead of two people locked in a room with only one unthinkable way out, there are eight. Eight strangers, unaware of their connection to each other, forced to play out a game that challenges their wits and puts their lives in jeopardy.James Wan and Leigh Whannell gave us a sharp and unique film last year, which shocked audiences around the world. It also had over-acting, major plot holes and mediocre pacing. Saw II manages to stay away from everything that was flawed with Saw, although, in doing so, it plays it too safe and loses all the shock that it wanted to give us.Much like the original, you will find some people in impossible situations, which are unique and great to watch. But Saw 2 tries to take it up a notch by putting more people in this situation, the more people you have the more clichés you need to put in. You get the macho guy, the mysterious guy, the pretty girl, the scared girl, the little kid, the one who knows whats going on, and the token black guy.Unlike the original, where you actually liked the characters, as annoying or over the top they may have been, here you hate them all. You know that most of them, if not all are going to die in some elaborate death, and this keeps us wanting to see more, just so we can watch them die in Jigsaw's house of horrors. Saw 2 focuses more on booby traps then clues for it's players. Even if there were more clues, the people don't care about them, or the director didn't care enough to enlighten us with them.With these clues, you would expect the people inside to pull together and try to solve this puzzle, instead they all turn on each other. One guy finds out what the first clue was and goes on a killing rampage. It's pretty much the same formula as the first, which makes this saw rusty and dull. The original had many jaws drop to the floor with it's twist ending, and going into Saw 2, you would expect the same. There is a twist, more then one to be precise, which is probably the best thing in this film. Although it never reaches the high-point of the original.How can a film that has better acting, not as many plot holes and more on Jigsaw, not be as good you might as yourself. It's basically the overall feel of the movie. I got chills throughout the entire first film, here I got one. Without ruining it, I'll just say that when the lights went on, my eyes were wide open with disbelief.Donnie Whalberg is much better in this film, then Danny Glover was in the first. In this installment, he actually has a reason to be here. Aside from the creepy Tobin Bell, Whalberg actually gives a good performance.Everyone else in the house just plays their characters they way they were written. Scream on cue, cry here, and die there.Excluding the house and all it's traps, the film only showcases one other Jigsaw predicament. A man with a bear trap on his face, who must cut out his own eye in order to get the key to unlock the contraption. Very cool, but not like the reverse bear trap on the girl's jaw from the original. Why did I like the first so much, well it was cool seeing all those little trap he put people in. That was missing from this one. The traps inside the house had wre impossible to get out of, the people were doomed and you knew it.Nevertheless, Saw 2 does end with a twist that sets up a possible third installment. Hopefully in the next one, the saw is sharper and the traps are more convincing. If I were ever in a situation with Jigsaw, I would listen to him carefully and follow his every step, I even yelled at the detective to do so. Saw 2 doesn't put to rest the ongoing debate of whether or not Dr. Gordon is alive or dead and it shouldn't, it should be up to interpretation.Saw 2 was quickly written and directed because it wanted to ride the success of the first and it shows. If time was taken and people who first brought it to us were still involved, Saw 2 could have surpassed the original. The script was written before Saw came out and had nothing to do with it. Once Saw became a hit, a few changes were made and it became Saw 2. So when a script is not written directly for the sequel purpose, you know you're in for trouble.

This is my first post on IMDb. The reason I am devoting my first post to such a crappy movie is the 7/10 rating here fooled me into renting this DVD and now I want my money and time back. The biggest issue of this film is its lackluster plot. It's just painfully dumb comparing to similar film like "Cube" , which was shot ~ 10 yrs ago (are films getting better today ?). In "Cube", you also got people waking up inside some closed cell and they need to solve some puzzle to find their way out. But in SAW II, there isn't really any puzzle to solve. For the most part of the movie, you just watch the characters running around and getting killed. There is no intelligence involved in this movie. BTW, the characters are poisoned, this greatly compromises their mobility and thus makes it a lot harder for them to move from A to B, which in turn lengthens the film a lot. Also the traps are pretty lame. Another issue is that the characters are so stereotypical (loud and rowdy). The moment they are first introduced, I know they will start killing each other before long. Overall the movie deserves 1/10 and I wish I could give it -10^10 just to counter balance all the positive ratings this film doesn't deserve. Seriously, if you think this movie is good, you should watch "Cube" and think about the improvement filmmakers have achieved over 10 yrs. Also you should watch "Cabin Fever" coz it's an equally crappy movie and crappy movies have a lot in common.

This was not the perfect movie, but it was also leagues better than most contemporary horror movies. I wanted to discuss the positives and negatives in my review but then also address common complaints from other reviews and forums.The absolute best part of the movie (many of the detractors even give this credit) was a detailed look into Jigsaw's past and his twisted motivations. The traps were decent - I think too many people romanticized the traps of the first Saw when many of the new ones relied on the exact same cringe factor that made the first movie so effective. I feel that in order to appreciate Saw II, you really have to approach the subject in a similar matter to Jigsaw. Sure, the situations in the movie were not scary like "Hellraiser" scary. Instead, if you look at it more like a psychological experiment, the true dark genius of the movie comes out. What would happen if eight people awoke in a room, their lives in danger, and no certain way to save them? We see immediately all of these very distinct personalities working together or against each other. Despite best intentions, there's always going to be some violent ass like Xavier that ruins even the most well laid plans. Thus, even "capable" humans are brought down by the defects of those around them.The drawbacks - there was no single scene that was comparable in terms of tension to the "Adam camera" scene from Saw. Also, at 93 minutes, I felt like some of the characters (Laura, Gus, Addison) never got a chance to be developed. It would have been great to have seen their traps explained or heard their back stories. However, this can be explained by reference to the plot. As a cohesive group, the hostages were a failure. Who knows how vividly the characters could have been described if they had opened Xavier's door or worked together better? But if they had been successful, more of them would have gotten the antidotes and there would have been less urgency all around. So it seems like some characters had to be sacrificed to keep the movie going.I've noticed a lot of people expressing incredulity at some of the logic in the movie and it's been bothering me for two reasons. First of all, I know plenty of people who are willing to suspend disbelief for some stupid action flick, but not for a horror movie. This doesn't necessarily describe the exact people writing reviews - my point is only that horror should probably given more slack than other types of movies. Second of all, a lot of the "illogical" reactions are not all that crazy when you think about them.For instance, why did Xavier cut the number off of his neck instead of asking politely? Lots of people found this unrealistic simply because they CLAIM that they wouldn't do that. Well, it made perfect sense for the character who had been established as a heartless egomaniac up until that point. Also, let's not forget that there's only 1 antidote in the safe. If you have ONLY 15 minutes to live and have reason to believe that others will screw you over if you cooperate, you'd do something drastic too.Others claim that there's no way Amanda would go over to the "dark side" once having run through Jigsaw's gauntlet, herself. Again, this is not all that unbelievable. Psychologists have noted the phenomenon of Stockholm Syndrome, in which hostages come to identify with and even join their captors (Patty Hearst). Likewise, in abusive families, children who suffer psychological or physical abuse don't ALWAYS repeat this cycle, but they are much more likely to than the general population. I found Amanda the scariest part of the movie, not because Shawnee Smith can match the creepy gravitas of Tobin Bell (she can't), but the sheer notion of her transformation. Jigsaw, while not physically powerful has the ability to reproduce his twisted world view in formerly sane people, including the ones he's "tested." Shawnee is not capable of delivering the "game over" line like Tobin can, but the thought that the idea of Jigsaw won't die even when he's physically dead is truly one of the more disturbing aspects of the movie.

Saw II follows on the heels of Saw, as another taught, tense thriller. The mark of a great thriller/shocker/horror movie is the number of twists and turns, and this is what identifies Saw II as one of the better members of its genre.This is NOT a movie where people walk backwards into dark rooms. This is NOT a movie where people pull sheets off bodies. That's all too predictable for Saw II. In fact, there's virtually nowhere in this film, where you can say that you've got it figured out.Few movies keep me on the edge of my seat. This was one of them. There was no one dozing off during this flick. And the number of folks who walked out to take/make cell phone calls was the lowest I've ever seen.Like Saw, this sequel is more than a little bloody in some places, but that's to be understood. It was never promoted as a walk in the park. If you're in the mood for a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is worth a try.And this movie left more than a few folks in the audience waiting for another sequel.

The original Saw was probably my most favorite recent "horror" movie, so naturally I was excited when the second one came out. I saw it its opening weekend in theaters, and **THIS WAS IN PREVIEWS, SO I Don't CONSIDER IT A SPOILER** I see a man strapped to a chair, with this "Man in the Iron Mask"-like thing on with all sorts of pretty nails poking toward his face. If you've seen the first one, you can expect what it does. A TV turns on, and there's the puppet thing, and that creepy voice. I'm like "Hell yes!" and it seemed like a great beginning, and it truly does have a great idea going for it, but unfortunately it seems like they got lost in the success of the original and the new bigger budget and lost something. It became the traditional horror movie, with your typical predictable characters, and the innovation and claustrophobic feel of the original was gone. It wasn't scary, but then again I didn't think the first one was to be honest, I think they're more of a mental experience than anything. The weird acid-trip like camera shake still occurs, though thankfully less frequently, and it is like a bigger budget Saw. Think Land of the Dead. Still a Romero movie, but it didn't feel like one as much. Same thing applies here. The ending is cool for most people, but I honestly saw it coming. It gets a bit muddled, and by the end of it you really don't remember much except the very beginning and end. It's fun, and it's an interesting piece of this new Saw series, but it just doesn't seem to live up to the original for me. You watch it yourself and give it a chance. I give it a 6 1/2.

I have no idea what my title means, except that it sounded clever in my head. Hmm.I'll assume that you've already seen the original Saw and you're wondering if this is a worthy successor. In a word: yeah. But it's a very different approach. While the first Saw was brilliantly minimalistic, the story being staged almost entirely in one room, this second installment takes us out of the box. Gone is the claustrophobic feeling of confusion and good ole existentialistic "who am I" from the original, and instead we get more of a mystery as seen from the outside, as our hero Eric (Donnie Wahlberg) tries to crack the case before it's too late.Sure, the same elements existed in the first film, with 2 concurrent plots of victim & detective. But the draw of the first was to figure out why all these things are happening. Here the mystery is revealed in the first few minutes, the killer is apprehended, and what follows is a sort of chess game between investigator Eric and perp Jigsaw with the clock ticking to save the intended victims. It's actually a clever approach similar to the rather AWESOME film "Exorcist III" (1990) which is composed of dark dialogues between the detective and the lunatic, and this dramatic approach was repeated a year later in the more popular "Silence of the Lambs" (1991). But in this domain, in order for it to work, the film must be slow, almost painfully slow, thick and heavy.Saw II attempts to balance the heavy, psychological "Lambs" approach with good old fashioned slashes & gore. It succeeds, I feel. But I still can't help but wonder how it would've been if the filmmakers had gone full tilt "Lambs" on us. Instead the dialogues between Eric & Jigsaw seem a bit short, rushed and not fully explored.The result is a film which is certainly entertaining, but I don't think it will ever be considered a psychological classic like the other two I mentioned, or like "Seven"--films that are much slower in pace, with far fewer gallons of blood spilled but with oceans of drama.I know this may sound like a negative review, but that's only because I'm comparing Saw II to the heavyweights. If instead we take Saw II at face value, a straightforward horror flick, it certainly delivers. There's the added bonus of having two nice twists at the end. In terms of sheer entertainment value, Saw II cuts a real log.I should really quit trying to come up with witty puns.

Sequels rarely live up to the originals. And in the horror genre that's even rarer. I reckon that 'Saw' (part I) will always be better, due to its originality and shock value, but its (first) successor does its best to expand on the mythology and give the audience something more. In short... it's definitely worth a watch if you enjoyed the original.The first outing could be summed up best by 'two men wake up in a serial killer's lair and try to figure out how to escape.' However, there was far more to the story than just that and the amount of different twists and turns really struck a chord with audiences (that and the amount of 'body horror' that was involved.'Part II' ups the ante in every sense. There are more victims in the killer's latest 'lair,' more gore, more traps, more police officers trying to figure out where these hapless people are, perhaps most importantly, more of the killer himself (who was surprisingly not in the first installment very much). In fact... out of all the characters in the film, it's the killer 'Jigsaw' (Tobin Bell) who steals every scene.As with the first film, there's more to the story than just a bunch of people trying to escape from some fiendishly fatal death-traps. 'Saw II' does its best to keep the surprises coming and, like the first, you'll only have one chance to watch it without knowing all the plot twists that will be heading your way.So, if you liked the original then you should enjoy this one, too. In fact it's almost like these two films could have been written together and filmed back to back. After this one I only stayed with the franchise for a couple more films as the quality really does go downhill after this one. For me the 'Saw' franchise was a two-picture deal.

I have the same main problem I had with Saw II that I had with the original (Shockingly enough, not the gaping plot holes). At the core, both movies are about the same thing: Elaborate puzzles that stupid people ignore so they can spend more time yelling at each other.I really wanted to like Saw II, but I felt like I was being teased. I catch a whiff of interesting puzzle-solving, instead I have a lot of yelling.It's a personal preference, I know. The movie I wanted to see was about people adapting to their situation and using their brains against that of an evil genius. Instead, I got the evil genius (Tobin Bell is great as Jigsaw, by the way, one of the parts of the film I really enjoyed) going to a lot of work for some people who, frankly, don't seem to appreciate it. The creators seemed to want to make a film about how people's lives are dictated by their unavoidable flaws (driven home by the ending, the last few twists, and the general character of the cop, all of which are the reason my rating is as high as it is), and how panic destroys people.And the horror... isn't. I don't find blood scary. There are some *shocking* moments in this film, some cringe-inducing moments, but nothing actually scary. That really disappointed me, because Adam's capture in Saw I was one of the scarier scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time. There's nothing for people who actually want to be scared here, just grossed out.

Last night we were part of the lucky few(750 peoples) who got to see the world premiere to the public of Saw II. Without going too much into the details, for this kind of movie can be ruined quite easily by revealing to much, I can say that it was a good sequel albeit not as strong as the first one. I could compare quite easily having seen the first one the night before.First of all the character development, one of the greatest strength in the first one, is quasi inexistent in the sequel. This of course could be explain by the fact that having 8 characters locked together instead of only 2 gives less room for each one of them. Even if I liked the concept of having a bunch of people trapped, there could have been a way to remove some character and give a little more room to the background of the more important ones. This actually lead to a feeling of watching a more americanized version of saw. You actually loses a part of the psychology that was also very strong in the first one. This loss i could say is partly due to the fact that you again haver very little to base yourself on the background of the characters.Despite all of this it was entertaining. Most of the jigsaw's game of the sequel still have the same flavor as those in the original and the plot line in itself is still very good as you get to understand a little more behind the games of jigsaw. I recommend for all of you to watch it once its out in theater but don't go expecting the same feeling you had when watching Saw, you'll be disappointed.

A few unfortunates people(Glenn Plummer,Enmanuel Vaugier,Beverly Mitchell,Erik Knudsen, among others) trapped into closed building and they must encounter a way out before inhale a lethal nerve gas. But they must also avoid the deadly traps Jigsaw(Tobin Bell) has set on the way. Meanwhile, a policemen(Donnie Wahlberg,Dina Meyer) and SWAT track down from him. Jigsaw, who is on the brink of death , has become obsessed for revenge and has prepared twisted traps. The group must race against the clock of Jigsaw's on ticket heart affected by cancer.This second sequel from original by James Wan, packs grisly terror, tension, suspense and lots of blood and gore . The film takes accent as suspense as well as terror with creepy use of images- shock and slick edition. Provides an imaginative and well-knit screenplay plenty of twists and surprises . Sinister and mysterious atmosphere , well made by cameraman David Armstrong and eerie musical score adequate for mystery and tension by Charlie Clousier. The movie is again starred by Tobin Bell, he's a secondary actor working from the 80s in TV series(Walker Texas Rager, Stargate SG1, Alias, 24) and occasionally for cinema(Goodfellas, The firm, Ruby, Black mask 2), achieving success with Jigsaw character. The motion picture is well directed by Darren Lynn Bousman. It's followed by Saw III by same director and with Dina Meyer, Shawnee Smith and Costas Mandylor; Saw IV again with Donnie Wahlberg, Dina Meyer and in pre-production, Saw V directed by David Hacklin with Costas Mandylor.

I saw the original "Saw" when it came out in UK theaters back in 2004. I thought it was very good - thrilling, different and clever. The acting was pretty bad (especially the ending with Elwes' laughable facial contortions), but it was the jolt that horror sorely needed. It wasn't another slice-'em-dice'-em slasher flick - it was smarter.When I read that they were almost instantly putting "Saw II" into production based on the success of the original - and that pretty much no one from the original film was returning except for Tobin Bell (who plays Jigsaw) - I had very small hopes. I even said on the message board for the film at one point that it was going to ruin the impact of the original.Well, I was wrong. In many ways, "Saw II" is better than the original. The acting talents are far stronger -- Donnie Wahlberg (Marky Mark's brother) is so much better than Elwes was in the first film. Due credit to Elwes -- he's a fine actor usually, but in "Saw" he was embarrassing towards the end. Wahlberg is perfect for the film.Another nice twist in the plot is that it isn't totally repetitive as the trailers would lead you to believe. It does something I've never seen before - the killer is arrested within the first twenty minutes AND unmasked. Tobin Bell is on-screen throughout the entire film in plain view, having discussions with Wahlberg.The movie implements a lot of new twists such as the whole concept of "Rashomon"ing everything and going back and forth between different perspectives. The ending is brilliant because it's not just a throwaway shocker - it has a moral message that I never expected from this film.The movie's interweaving plots and self-referential layers (such as a revisiting of the bathroom from the first movie) provide lots of fun and Jigsaw's game with the detective in the film is thought-provoking - this film is so much smarter and better than I ever expected and I was really blown away by the fact that we still have the capability of making good sequels to good movies that offer something fresh, rather than simply retreading material from the original.

Saw 2 is a better than average movie with a promising storyline that just didn't turn out as good as it seemed.I did enjoy the dialog between Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bell,but the scenes with everyone stuck in the booty trapped room set up by Jigsaw was terrible,the dialog and acting was very mediocre and it mostly relied on gore.It is definitely more gory than the first Saw,a bit too gory for me,the way everyone is killed is just disgusting and graphic.The movie also wasn't as frightening as the first Saw and the story didn't have a build up as exciting as the original.I also didn't like how we didn't get to see much of the Jigsaw puppet and the direction isn't as dark (the director is different) as the first.Saw 2 is very gruesome,but its not very scary,if your a fan of the first you should still check it out,mainly because of Donnie Wahlberg and Tobin Bells impressive performances and a very unexpected twist,but you will be overall disappointed.The Jigsaw Killer has kidnapped the son of cop Eric Matthews.Jigsaw gets Eric to talk to him while his son and many others try to survive.

Shame, shame, shame. I actually enjoyed the first Saw quite a bit, and had hopes that this installment would meet or surpass its predecessor in quality. Poor guess on my part. I am a huge fan of horror movies...I have been watching them since I was a child. This was no horror movie. It was a poorly put-together "psychological" thriller with some violence in it. Part of what made the first movie good was the anonymous evil-doer. Having Jigsaw out and front all the time just didn't do it for me. The movie tries to justify his motivations, but his diatribes into the human condition fall short of convincing me. Fear of the unknown is one of the strongest types of fear there is, and having the killer spell out all his intentions is really kind of a let down. Also, the twist just left me snoring. And another thing (whine whine whine) was that I just could not suspend my disbelief. So there is this terminal cancer patient who can barely walk, yet is able to put many large sturdy devices together. Sure, he has help, but look at all the gear setup, and you'll see what I'm getting at. Also, Jigsaw must be psychic. His big ransom is the son of the detective. So he sets up all these traps in order to reach a desired outcome. What if people dropped dead from the nerve gas early? What if one of the criminals flipped out and killed the boy early? Sure, he might have profiled them, but I had some of these same issues with Mindhunters. The kicker is that I just don't care about any of the characters in this movie. They're all jerks, and it doesn't pain me to see them die. The end. Don't see this movie, it is a waste of time.

This movie has just mad a quantum leap in horror films. after watching this movie i had the chills walking to my car, and lets say that i more than enjoy a scary movie. this movie kept me up for at least and hour after watching it. it was one of those movies were you cant let it out of your mind. The movie had one of the best openings that i have seen in a long time. after a few minutes into the movie i had to put down my popcorn. i don't have a weak stomach and this movie got me to put down my popcorn, that is huge. With a great blend of suspense, acting, and oh yes there was a lot of blood. this movie great deserves another watch, i would pay to see this movie a couple of times. not to mention one of the best twists i have seen in a movie. i would say 2nd best ending i have seen in a movie.(#1 was Fight Club). you definitely have to see this movie.

When detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is called to a crime scene of a victim of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), he finds a lead to the place where he is hidden. Once there, he realizes that Jigsaw trapped his son Daniel Matthews (Erik Knudsen) with three women and four men in a shelter, and they are inhaling a lethal nerve gas. If they do not use an antidote within two hours, they will die. Eric follows with increasing desperation the death of each member of the group in monitors, while trying to convince Jigsaw to release his son."Saw II" is a scary, gore and disturbing movie certainly not recommended for audiences with problem with psychological and visual violence. The story is excellent, and the expected twists in the end are unpredictable and well tied up. This movie recalled me the atmosphere of "The Silence of the Lambs" and Tobin Bell performs a stunning sadistic and cold blood killer. His explanations how the knowledge of death changes everything is very logical, therefore frightening. The camera, the cinematography and the soundtrack contribute with the morbid atmosphere of this film. My vote is seven.Title (brazil): "Jogos Mortais II" ("Mortal Games II")

OK, if you've already seen the first one, you will be absolutely disappointed. it in no way lives up to the first one at all. first of all, saw was great because it was two kids on a low budget writing a script. they had to make up for the lack of money with the plot and script. secondly, the plot was really good and thick and everyone was connected in some odd way. the ending had so many twists, it was just brilliant. OK, now for saw 2. they had more money, so they definitely used it. instead of the people being in one room, it was one huge house. having more money took away from the effect, and most definitely the script, the plot and the acting. the plot had an unbelievable amount of holes in it. the people were connected by one stupid little line and the ending was absolutely ridiculous. one of the characters is just a complete idiot and decides to just get mad about everything. so, when he finds out there are numbers on the back of people's necks, instead of just kindly asking them to turn around, he kills them! finally, someone points out that he has a number on the back of his head that he's going to need, so he can't kill everyone. first of all, he tries seeing it with his little knife, then he decides to just cut it off, as any logical person would do. then, the murderer, john some how came up with a lot of money between dr gordon and now. before hand, his technique was simple. the tools he used to murder people could be found at a yardsale. in this one, somehow he got surgical equipment, the brains to do surgery and about five places with 20 computers. at some point in time, the writers seemed to have decided that it didn't matter that he had cancer, he can still do all this stuff. however, when you see him, he's in pretty bad shape. OK, now for the ending. remember the changed druggy, amanda? well, apparently, after she was almost killed, she decided the entire idea was a good one. so, she comes to john as an apprentice and decides to take his place as jigsaw. john becomes her yoda and teaches her the way of murder. at the end of saw 1, john had the memorable line of "GAME OVER". it was so great because of his voice, his appearance, everything. at the end of saw 2, amanda comes in, looking like she just went shopping and got her hair done and put on make up, and in a very little girl voice says "game over". absolutely horrible.

Jigsaw kidnaps a few unsuspecting 'criminals' along with the son of a detective. Having been unappreciative of their lives, the dying Jigsaw challenges the hostages to escape the house they are held in. The victims have two hours to find antidotes in order to escape a virus with which they are infected, involving deadly tasks and booby traps, as well as negotiating differences with their fellow-captives. Meanwhile Detective Matthews seeks to find where his son is being held through interrogating Jigsaw, the true colours of the cop coming out through the course of the film.Mixed within the depth of violence and suspense of the film lies juxtaposed moralistic messages and a superb plot that is increasingly rare in the genre in modern times. However, for some, the violence may be too much, indeed the processes of killing the subjects are ingenious but not in any way subtle. However, if you're going to watch Saw II, then it's unlikely that your shy of horror, and you'll get it in bucket-loads, as well as a twist at the end that is as good as any you'll see in cinemas today.Overall as a film Saw II is very good, it's entertaining, thou such a strong plot may have benefited from not seeming to want to rely so heavily on graphic violence. It probably won't go down as a classic and it's certainly not for everyone (don't rent it for the kids one night), but it's certainly one of the better 'scary' movies of recent times and worthy of a trip to the cinema or DVD store.

Saw was already a movie with a deep, terrific plot. The sequel contained the same, although it just isn't as great as the first one. First off, there are much more people locked inside the trap. Therefore, if one gets angry or upset, they can kill each other, like Xavier did. Chaos and fights will start between people, unlike the first one where there were only an amount of two, so if one dies the other one will most likely go too. Torture scenes were just as brutal and left you with eyes opened wide enough to make your eyes dry up. Such as Amanda jumping into a pool of syringes, Obi being cooked up in an oven.Parts of the movie weren't as confusing and mind boggling anymore. I understand that "The Devil May help You" for Obi, but it's kind of obvious. Also, the first one tells the story of each person and WHY they are in the trap and HOW they aren't appreciating their lives. This one only explains probably one or two.I'd give props to the ending, because it was just a complete shock to me. I couldn't believe the fact that Amanda was faking the whole time and how she was actually helping Jigsaw, and that the surveillance camera was set 2 hours back already. As Jigsaw said, if Eric Matthews would have listened, his son is SAFE. Instead, he didn't listen, and he ended up dead, when his son was in a safe next to him.Overall, this movie was pretty good, just wasn't AS good as the first one. I would watch it again, but it wouldn't give me much interest after a while since it's pretty shady and dull.

The first Saw really through me through some spins and caught me off guard for originality, Saw 2 is leagues above the first. Saw 2 runs with the same game based theme as the first, with clues for both the characters and the audience about what might happen next, but it takes the game to a completely different level. Just when things start to come together there is another twist to leave the viewer on the edge of their seat for what may come next. Without seeming to give everything away the movie was made to give it all away, but no one can catch all the clues because they have been pulled so deep into the movie. I highly recommend this one.

Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the methodical serial killer from Saw, is back! This time, he's pitted against a tough detective (Donnie Wahlberg), who must try to save his son and others from a house of horrors filled with deadly nerve gas, puzzles and death traps.Saw 2 is just as scary and suspenseful as the original. The death traps are very creative and some of the twists are unpredictable. The original Saw was a very suspenseful film that actually terrified its audience. The sequel is more or less the same except its much bloodier. Whether or not that's a good thing is entirely up to you but it was fine by me. There were more scary, over the top gory scenes in this film then in the original Saw. There were more characters as well and that kind of hurt the film since they were all one dimensional. Some of them didn't even share their story of why they were there. The acting was well not so good. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who has seen the original film.Tobin Bell probably gives the best performance as Jigsaw. This guy is defiantly very scary and very creepy. You see a lot more of him this time around so it made the film better. Donnie Wahlberg plays the detective who is trying to hunt down the people being tortured. He does a decent job though nothing special. Shawnee Smith plays Amanda and she also gives a decent performance. Everyone else was either too over the top or under performed. The worst was Beverley Mitchell but she's from 7th Heaven so that shouldn't be too much of a surprise. James Wan didn't direct this one and it shows. The original relied more on suspense to scare its audience while this one focuses more on disturbing scenes. There were disturbing scenes in Saw but that wasn't what the film was really about. So, the director for Saw 2 isn't as good as Wan. Also, the film is too short so the story feels rushed and its not as effective as it could have been. Like the original, it's hard to feel sorry for the characters because they do bad things and are so unlikable but that's just me. In the end, Saw 2 is a very gory and violent sequel that lives up to the original. Rating 8/10.

Let's start by saying what this movie did have, that will take a lot less time. Gore check. Creepy puppet and various devices used to permanently dismantle people's craniums check. Pasty cancer victim forcing the "unworthy" to develop some want to survive check. Alright, now that that's done I can move on to other, more pressing issues.I know that everybody, myself included, simply adored the twist ending to the first Saw. Finally learning that the "dead" guy who'd been lying in a pool of his own blood for the entire movie wasn't really dead and was in fact an ingenious, if not twisted as hell, cancer victim striving to show people the value of their meaningless lives was a treasured moment in horror movie history. I can't say much about its staying power in the minds of the general public I will always remember watching that body rise from the floor of that bathroom.Of course the producers couldn't just reenact the twist from the first one, they had to take it a step farther, keep people guessing. So how do you top a twist as well developed and well executed as the one in Saw? If you take a hint from Saw II I guess the answer is to make the ending so ridiculously contrived that nobody would ever dream of guessing it for fear of feeling stupid even in their own mind. Though I'm sure the girl who played Amanda was thrilled to get her second major acting gig reviving the heroine-addict she so briefly portrayed in the first Saw, I didn't appreciate her reappearance quite so much. It was completely pointless to bring her back; she was useless in the first movie and even more useless in this one. When you get right down to it they used her presence as out: this way they could kill off our friend the cancer victim and still keep the series going. At least we can sleep easy knowing "Amanda" won't soon be out of work.Unfortunately, the real sin in the writing here is that they simply took it too far. All they had to do was leave it with the SWAT team figuring out that the whole thing was staged and that the kid was really in a "safe" place. That would have been more than enough for me. Also, I could have done without Beverley Mitchell crying constantly, but they couldn't have cast the part better. A decade of complaining on 7th Heaven made her the perfect choice for the part.The one redeemable quality of this film is the thing that made the first one: a truly original and inventive antagonist. This guy ranks up there with Hannibal and John Doe of Seven on my list of awesome villains. This is where the writers showed their true prowess. They managed to do what is rare these days: they created a powerfully psychopathic serial killer that had a defendable philosophy. "Those who don't value life don't deserve life." It sounds cruel, but there is some part in all of us that has to agree with the sentiment if not the deeds carried out in its name. It bothers me that he claims never to have killed anyone because it seems to me that putting people into a situation where they will almost certainly perish and offering them only a slim chance for survival is grounds for a murder charge. I know what he means, but that one statement is the only stupid thing that he says and he continues to say it despite the glaring error in it. That fact aside, this guy continues to impress me. He outsmarts everybody. The beauty in his strategy is that he tells everybody exactly what they need to know in order to walk out of their given situation entirely intact. He just banks on the fact that people never change and they, when put under immense stress, default to their baser instincts instead of taking a second to think the situation out rationally. The sad truth about humankind is that he will never be disappointed.Overall I enjoyed the movie, but I had pretty low expectations to begin with. I expected exactly what I got: a solid villain and an hour and a half of gratuitous violence and blood. If you're looking for a great piece of cinematography you're going to be sorely upset with what you see; you'll probably be a little motion-sick by the end too. Bring your sense of humor and check your upchuck reflex at the door, especially if you are sensitive about the use of scalpels on eyeballs.

The tag line says it all: Oh yes, there will be blood!I've had the chance/honor of seeing the sequel of a very anticipated movie this year at the world's premiere at the Montreal's Midnight Madness and I haven't been disappointed one bit. Off course, there was some magic that night, considering the fact that there were hundreds of horror fans expecting a gory sequel to the Saw installment and they got served! Without stating any spoilers, let me confirm that the movie is packed with bloody action and gore at its best. Those who liked the Jigsaw's strategy of allowing him the chance of survival to its victims by giving them a puzzle to solve, this time it goes even further. From the start until the end, you'll be given puzzling situation in which you wouldn't like to be part of at any time in your life. Near the end of the movie, the twisted game gets even more spicy...I wasn't used to hear people applauding at the theater and it created some kind of psycho ambiance in the room that I kinda really enjoyed. The sadistic approach of the Jigsaw killer is still pretty impressive! Without telling you more, go watch it with some friends that will be able to tolerate blood in gallons and you'll be served! I give it a 9/10 for its originality, gory moments, interesting story and punch of action. It is rare to see a sequel that beats its predecessor but in this case, it does!

Wow. While I enjoyed the first Saw, let me say this sequel was an utter disgrace. If its title were an anagram, as in my heading, it would be more honest. This movie was an exercise in shock video, not a horror film. Believe me, there is a difference. It looks like today's audiences have forgotten, or, judging by some poster's ages, never gotten the chance to experience, what a true horror film is.Some reviews which gave this high ratings said they did so because it had "more movement", was "more gory and bloody" and "leaves it open for the next installment." Well, none of those suggests a superior piece of cinema. The script was poor, editing was spastic, and the characters were absent. Even in this age of sequels, need we be reminded a 90 minute film is not an episode? This is a clumsily slapped together torture fest which is missing the mystery, the characterization, and the human element of the first. Horror needs pacing, buildup, and subtlety. Apparently, bloodshed, arguing, and a tacked on twist ending which made little sense scare people nowadays. And I haven't even delved into plot yet! In short, Saw II takes the could-be mystery and shines a light on it, takes the entities and blurs them, takes the audience and leads us by the hand to a ridiculous ending. Save your time and money, and watch some old horror on DVD instead.

While investigating the bloody aftermath of a grizzly murder, Detective Eric Matthews has the feeling that it is the work of Jigsaw, the notorious killer who disappeared leaving a trail of bodies behind. Jigsaw is indeed back, but instead of two people locked in a room with only one unthinkable way out, there are eight. Eight strangers, unaware of their connection to each other, forced to play out a game that challenges their wits and puts their lives in jeopardy.James Wan and Leigh Whannell gave us a sharp and unique film last year, which shocked audiences around the world. It also had over-acting, major plot holes and mediocre pacing. Saw II manages to stay away from everything that was flawed with Saw, although, in doing so, it plays it too safe and loses all the shock that it wanted to give us.Much like the original, you will find some people in impossible situations, which are unique and great to watch. But Saw 2 tries to take it up a notch by putting more people in this situation, the more people you have the more clichés you need to put in. You get the macho guy, the mysterious guy, the pretty girl, the scared girl, the little kid, the one who knows whats going on, and the token black guy.Unlike the original, where you actually liked the characters, as annoying or over the top they may have been, here you hate them all. You know that most of them, if not all are going to die in some elaborate death, and this keeps us wanting to see more, just so we can watch them die in Jigsaw's house of horrors. Saw 2 focuses more on booby traps then clues for it's players. Even if there were more clues, the people don't care about them, or the director didn't care enough to enlighten us with them.With these clues, you would expect the people inside to pull together and try to solve this puzzle, instead they all turn on each other. One guy finds out what the first clue was and goes on a killing rampage. It's pretty much the same formula as the first, which makes this saw rusty and dull. The original had many jaws drop to the floor with it's twist ending, and going into Saw 2, you would expect the same. There is a twist, more then one to be precise, which is probably the best thing in this film. Although it never reaches the high-point of the original.How can a film that has better acting, not as many plot holes and more on Jigsaw, not be as good you might as yourself. It's basically the overall feel of the movie. I got chills throughout the entire first film, here I got one. Without ruining it, I'll just say that when the lights went on, my eyes were wide open with disbelief.Donnie Whalberg is much better in this film, then Danny Glover was in the first. In this installment, he actually has a reason to be here. Aside from the creepy Tobin Bell, Whalberg actually gives a good performance.Everyone else in the house just plays their characters they way they were written. Scream on cue, cry here, and die there.Excluding the house and all it's traps, the film only showcases one other Jigsaw predicament. A man with a bear trap on his face, who must cut out his own eye in order to get the key to unlock the contraption. Very cool, but not like the reverse bear trap on the girl's jaw from the original. Why did I like the first so much, well it was cool seeing all those little trap he put people in. That was missing from this one. The traps inside the house had wre impossible to get out of, the people were doomed and you knew it.Nevertheless, Saw 2 does end with a twist that sets up a possible third installment. Hopefully in the next one, the saw is sharper and the traps are more convincing. If I were ever in a situation with Jigsaw, I would listen to him carefully and follow his every step, I even yelled at the detective to do so. Saw 2 doesn't put to rest the ongoing debate of whether or not Dr. Gordon is alive or dead and it shouldn't, it should be up to interpretation.Saw 2 was quickly written and directed because it wanted to ride the success of the first and it shows. If time was taken and people who first brought it to us were still involved, Saw 2 could have surpassed the original. The script was written before Saw came out and had nothing to do with it. Once Saw became a hit, a few changes were made and it became Saw 2. So when a script is not written directly for the sequel purpose, you know you're in for trouble.

This is my first post on IMDb. The reason I am devoting my first post to such a crappy movie is the 7/10 rating here fooled me into renting this DVD and now I want my money and time back. The biggest issue of this film is its lackluster plot. It's just painfully dumb comparing to similar film like "Cube" , which was shot ~ 10 yrs ago (are films getting better today ?). In "Cube", you also got people waking up inside some closed cell and they need to solve some puzzle to find their way out. But in SAW II, there isn't really any puzzle to solve. For the most part of the movie, you just watch the characters running around and getting killed. There is no intelligence involved in this movie. BTW, the characters are poisoned, this greatly compromises their mobility and thus makes it a lot harder for them to move from A to B, which in turn lengthens the film a lot. Also the traps are pretty lame. Another issue is that the characters are so stereotypical (loud and rowdy). The moment they are first introduced, I know they will start killing each other before long. Overall the movie deserves 1/10 and I wish I could give it -10^10 just to counter balance all the positive ratings this film doesn't deserve. Seriously, if you think this movie is good, you should watch "Cube" and think about the improvement filmmakers have achieved over 10 yrs. Also you should watch "Cabin Fever" coz it's an equally crappy movie and crappy movies have a lot in common.

Having been taunted by twisted killer Jigsaw, Detective Eric Matthews cracks the clue that leads him directly to the hide-out where they capture the man himself. However Jigsaw directs Matthews' attention to a bank of monitors that show a group of people stuck in a locked house  one of whom is Matthews young son. The people in the house are breathing in a deadly nerve gas which will kill them in two hours, but they have the ability to solve puzzles to get out before then. While they try to solve the deadly puzzles, Matthews tries to break Jigsaw to find out where the house is.When Saw was a big success in the cinemas it was only a matter of time before a sequel was produced that tried to repeat the success all over again and duly this does feel like a film that has been produced to cash in. Of course this is not to say that it isn't any good but suffice to say that it doesn't quite match up the energy and tension of the first film. It does still produce the goods as a teenage style horror movie, with moments that made me cringe and look away all doing just enough to keep the film moving. Problem was more with the plot, which was never going to be as cool as the first film mainly because it couldn't be as simple and sharp. Instead we have a baggier and more contrived set up that doesn't work as well. The stuff with Matthews and Jigsaw doesn't really connect that well to the action in the house and, although part of the twist was reasonably clever, it did rather feel like it was more about setting up more sequels than producing a big impacting finish.The cast are mixed but limited by the material. Bell is good but, considering he is the heart of the story, he doesn't get much to do and is not as good a presence as he needed to be within the narrative (although the producers clearly feel the series doesn't need him so who am I to speak?). Wahlberg is cut off from the action and although he shouts well, he cannot develop the character that was needed in order to explain the plot and make the ending. The rest of the cast are so much filler and generally they run, shout, scream and die as required without doing much to make themselves stand out; basically when the most famous face is "the guy from Speed" then you know you are in trouble.Overall then this is an OK Hollywood horror movie that has a nice mean streak running through it from start to finish. The story is a bit weak and doesn't have the impact of the original, a problem not helped by the lack of good characters. Fans of the original will probably still like it but it is hard to ignore that this is much lesser product than the first film.

Saw II continued the legacy of the Saw franchise and cemented it into cult popularity in my opinion. While the first saw appealed to the gory disturbing side of every one, we get a little more in depth with the other concept of Jigsaw in this installment. Saw II dives deeper into the psychological side of, do you deserve to live if you've made others' lives harder? Not only that but Saw II steps up the scare factor by putting a bunch of strangers in an enclosed space with various iconic traps.
