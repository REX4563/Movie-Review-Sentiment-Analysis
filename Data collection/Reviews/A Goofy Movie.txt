This is one of the best Disney films I have seen. If you are young, you will fully identify with the characters, and if you're not so young, this film will make you remember many things you left behind. The expression of the characters is sensational, the music is very good, the screenplay is fantastic, and there are lots of intelligent cinematography effects used. I find it a little short, but I'm sure that children will appreciate that (as far as I can remember, I never was able to watch a long movie when I was a child). My final rating is 8-9 out of 10.

I do not see why this isn't on the Disney classics list. It is well animated, well scripted, heartwarming and it has better songs than many other Disney films. It deals with Goofy taking his son Max out on a road trip after Max sabotages an assembly. Meanwhile Max wants to stay so he can go to his favorite singer's concert and go out with his crush from school Roxanne. When compared to almost every other Disney cartoon, this one has more emotion. You feel genuinely sad or happy when Goofy and Max are getting along, or when Goofy is trying. I actually felt sad when Max gets mad at Goofy for taking him to the Possom show. It's a great movie, and I highly recommend any fan of animation find it.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****.

Goofy has always been one of my most favorite Disney characters and I always found it a shame he had no feature length film (like Mickey Mouse whom I really do not like that much). In 1995 though Goofy got his feature length film, but it took me until now to see it. It was not for rent here, but I was lucky enough to catch an English spoken version on it on German TV (films on German TV are usually overdubbed in German) so I was very happy to have caught it. I was not let down, neither by Disney, nor by Goofy. The movie was not as good as the Disney movies who are targeted for big audiences, but I still liked it quite a lot. The story was pretty realistic and good, there were enough laughs, but also some emotional' moments. All in all, something of everything and something for everybody. From me, that gets a:
7 out of 10

This one seemed to pass without notice in the theaters which is what I figured it deserved, but upon seeing it some time later on video I was surprised at how much fun this buddies on the road flick really is. 
Goofy is, for the most part, the lighthearted walking disaster we'd expect him to be.  But surprsingly enough, he shows a serious range of emotion, and actually pulls it off.  You really can sense his devotion to his son, Max, and you never have to remind yourself that Goofy would have ever been anything but a deeply caring father. It just works naturally as a genuine extension of his gregarious character.  Max himself is believably adoloscent, primarily concerned with getting asked to parties and getting the pretty girl to notice him and hoping his father doesn't publicly humiliate him (which he does, frequently), until his dad forces him along on a fishing trip which becomes a test of conscience for the both of them.  The movie mixes Goofy's classic slapstick comedy with serious drama and seems to know just when to switch gears to keep from getting too melodramatic or losing sight of the conflict at the center of the story.  In the end, the dramatic bits feel surprisingly honest and human and the comedy is, as I said, classic Goofy schtick.  It was made when Disney thought EVERYthing they did had to be a musical, but the songs here work into the story fairly easily, and a couple are even catchy.The only sad part is that the age group which could probably stand to learn the most from it will unequivocally find it "uncool".  Oh well, the younger set as well as more mature people who love to laugh will find it plenty entertaining.

Having grown up watching it, it's one of my personal favorite kid movies of the 1990's. If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves. I have to admit, it was probably this movie that convinced me to come out of my shell and made the rest of my life more enjoyable and memorable. I have to say the humor works, physical slapstick, and jokes. Some of its jokes are pretty out there like odd breaking the fourth wall humor. I loved the Lester's possum park. I don't know if it was making fun of Disneyland or not, but it was funny. Always made me laugh. This always reminded me of Chuck E. Cheese. The big foot scene was hilarious as well. The supporting cast work even Pauley Shore as Max's friend, Bobby. I'm just glad, he had a small role. Good to see Jim Cummings voicing Pete. He is a voice actor legend. The animation was pretty OK, it wasn't catchy. It look like animation, you give a TV show, not a full length animation movie. The title also is kinda wrong. It's not a Goofy movie, but a movie about Max. Goofy only plays a supporting role in the film. Kinda like a second banana. I do have to say the movie have a musical like theme throughout the film. I love every song in the film. After Today is 'The Part of your world' emotional ballad for the Disney teenager male setting the table type song that mostly sang by Disney heroines. The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. "On the Open Road" and 'Nobody Else But You" are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out. The second uses a much more cliché theme of old vs. new, and though it does work and is interesting, never goes the extra mile to address anything of true importance. So I like this movie, better. Overall: There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me. It had an old concept, the buddy/father-son/coming-of-age adolescence film. But it did it in just a very fresh, very appealing way for me.

Max is constantly embarrassed by his father, Goofy. Now considering that Goofy is a complete idiot and major dork, you can understand Max's feelings about this. But Max is no prize either...he's a teenager!! Plus, to impress a girl, he lies and says that he's friends with a famous singer and will be at the big concert in Los Angeles. The film is about their road trip across America...and Goofy has no idea that Max wants to go to the concert. So, instead, he's planned a LOT of lame vacation stops....all the types to make teens cringe.I really liked "A Goofy Movie" but cannot see giving it a score higher than 7. The reasons were that the movie featured Pauly Shore as one of Max's friends....and frankly, ANY Pauly Shore in a movie is too much. Additionally, the film simply was an extension of the television show...and looked much like a TV show. But, on the positive side, it really, really had a lot of heart and had a lot of real issues in the film--such as a father having a hard time letting his son grow up as well as how tough it is to be a teen...with all that angst, uncertainty and goofiness. Well worth seeing...warts and all.

When I grew up I watched A Goofy Movie ritually, and it never ceased to entertain me. This is a great children's film and can still relate to today's kids. The humor is enjoyable, the characters are lovable. The music is definitely bearable, whereas with most musical animated films the songs can really grate on the nerves. Perhaps it's just because I practically was raised on this film that I enjoy it so much, but I have given it to my little brother and he loves it as well. It's a great experience for any kid and shouldn't be missed. It's even a little fun for adults, and I am not ashamed to say I still enjoy it as well. A Disney classic! 10/10

When it comes to animated cartoon features, the delineating line is now almost as simple as "pre-Toy Story" and "post-Toy Story". Before that Disney-Pixar team-up cartoons in theaters were for kids and kids alone. Young kids, at that. What Toy Story proved, however, is that an animated flick could transcend that boundary and appeal to adults as well as children.Just 6-7 or so scant months before Toy Story changed everything, A Goofy Movie premiered and largely got "lost in the shuffle", I believe. Had it dropped a bit later, perhaps it could have better captured the momentum. As it was, A Goofy Movie transfixed pre-teen adolescent audiences--including yours truly--for a (very) short time with its odd-yet-winning mix of music, humor, family relationships, and shenanigans.For a basic plot summary, this story tells the story of Max (Jason Marsden), son of the infamous Goofy (Bill Farmer), going through his adolescence. Despite being extremely self-conscious of his appearance and gulp-like chuckle, he strives to win the attention of Roxanne (Kellie Martin). Just when things seem to be looking up on that front, Dad Goofy decides to take him on a weeks-long, father-son fishing excursion across the country. Max promises Roxanne he's going to the Driveline concert--the most popular band ever!--setting himself up for a tangled web of decisions and emotions out on the open road with Pops.I know it sounds ridiculous considering this a cartoon starring Goofy, but I honestly believe this little film (about 78 minutes in total) could be watched 100 years from now and still have the same effect on viewers. I truly don't think this is a case of me suffering from "90s nostalgia" and rating this film higher because "I liked it as a kid".The beginning of the film feels very much High School Musical-esque, with teen drama taking center stage. I don't care if it's 1995 or 2025, the concept of awkward teen boy trying to talk to/impress equally awkward teen girl is universal. The same can be said for when Max and Goofy hit the road together, as the tenuous relationship between pre-teen son and goofball father is once again ageless. Whether through great writing/directing or pure dumb luck, this movie stumbles upon a gold mine of relevant themes.Like I said, if only Disney knew what they potential had at this point. No self-respecting adult would have willingly sat through this in theaters at the time (there was no precedent for that), and Disney had not yet figured out how to market such fare to wide audiences either. As a result, the movie gets sucked into a sort of "black hole" of quality content that had an extremely short shelf life.The bottom line, though, is this: I watched A Goofy Movie while I was still in grade school and loved it. I watched it as a 33-year old adult...and still enjoyed it. All things considered, I view that as a remarkable achievement. Sadly, only those within a year or two (at most) proximity to myself will have any real knowledge/appreciation of this movie, but that set will show it to their children at some point, I can almost guarantee you that!

OK, I'm a grown up man and I love this movie. I know I have kids but shouldn't I want to watch grown up films? Maybe this is actually just a good movie that adults and kids alike can enjoy.This is a well underrated full-length cartoon movie about Goofy taking his son Max camping for the summer vacation. You know what Goofy is like from his appearances in Mickey Mouse films and the name Goofy sums it up. To make things more interesting, Max is wanting to be the cool kid in school and his dad is an embarrassment.The trek across the States in Goofy's little car and all the madcap things that happen to them reminded me of the original "Vacation" film only for kids and a little funnier.The music in this film is excellent. Some of the tracks could have been singles in the charts in their own right. Maybe not nowadays though.If you have kids then they will love this film. If you don't have kids go to the video shop, hire it out and pretend it is for the kids.

Believe it or not, this is a good movie. It's kinda weird... but in a good way. The music in this movie kinda sucks, but that's my biggest complaint.

I remember seeing this cartoon film from Walt Disney Pictures at least once when I was younger, but for some reason I forced myself into watching it again when grown up, probably just to get a definite opinion, but I knew it was going to be terrible no matter what. Basically school has ended and summer has begun, teenage Max Goof (Jason Marsden) wants to catch the eye of beautiful fellow student Roxanne (Kellie Martin), so he stages an impromptu concert at the final assembly. Max's father Goofy (Bill Farmer) gets a call from Principal Mazur (Toy Story's Wallace Shawn), he exaggerates events and warns that if Max's actions may one day have him facing capital punishment, Goofy has the idea to get Max away from everything by taking him on vacation. Max has succeeded becoming a celebrity and impressing Roxanne, she agrees to go to a party where a live performance by pop singer Powerline will be showing, but then Goofy blows his plans announcing they are going on a fishing trip together in his station wagon, following a map route to Lake Destiny, Idaho. Max is forced to call off the date with Roxanne, but he fabricates a story that his father knows Powerline and tells her that he will be with the pop star when they go live on stage at the concert. Max is miserable throughout the journey to go fishing, Pete (Jim Cummings) and his son and Max's friend P.J. (Rob Paulsen) join them on the way, Pete advises Goofy to keep Max under control, and of course, with Goofy around, the trip is full of disasters, including spending the night with Bigfoot (Scooby-Doo's Frank Welker). Stopping during the journey at night Max alters the route map to change the destination to Los Angeles, where the concert is being held, Goofy decides in the morning to make Max navigator, and allow them to stop along the way wherever he chooses. Pete on one of their stops overhears Max and P.J. talking about Max's change to the map, he tells Goofy, but he refuses to believe him, but looking at the map for himself he knows he has been duped. Goofy gets very angry when Max directs him towards California instead of Idaho, they fight and end up with the car crashing into the river, but they survive, they reconcile and Goofy understands Max wanting to impress a girl he feels for, and Max saves his dad from a waterfall death using a fishing technique he taught him. Goofy and Max make it to Los Angeles and the concert, through unintentional gatecrashing they both end up dancing on stage with Powerline during his performance, watched by everyone from school, including Roxanne. In the end, after returning home, Max tells Roxanne the truth, but she admits she always had feelings for him, since he said "Ahyuck!" (the Goofy laugh), they start a relationship, the car explodes and Goody falls through the house roof, this allows Max to introduce Roxanne to his dad. Also starring Kevin Lima as Lester, Florence Stanley as Waitress and Jo Anne Worley as Miss Maples. The film is essentially a film adaptation of the TV show Goof Troop (which I watched sometimes younger and liked), but with the kid character now a teenager, Goofy in this is unfortunately not suited as a dad, his chaotic antics are not as fun to watch as the original shorts from the past, in fact in this I found him highly irritating, and his teen son with an attitude is no better. In fact the entire film was irritating, only creating titters of laughs, and the most predictable and ordinary story, I knew it was going to be terrible, and it was, not one I'd even bother showing your children, a rather rubbish animated comedy. Pretty poor!

I remember the old Goof Troop show when I was a kid. It was fun but perhaps a too well " Goofy" for me now. It was a cartoon after all, and when I heard about this movie I thought this would be the same. Boy was I wrong.This movie truly reaches out for kids, teens, and adults. The whole plot revolves around Max trying to get the girl, making a name for himself, and well not trying to be a complete Goof. So he does what all kids in real life do, well more or less. Basicaly he holds a little surprise concert in the middle of an assembly, with him starring as the schools favorite singer Powerline. Well he gets Roxanne's attention, but also that of his father who thinks maybe he should spend a little more time with his son, making sure Max will turn out to be a good kid.(The characters)Goofy Its good seeing Goofy trying to be a real parent. To me in Goof troop he was more like Max's older friend. Though Goofy doesn't seem to be as goofy as he was on the old cartoons, this shows something of a better side him. Trying to be a good father, who just wants to be part of his son's life.Max Well he's a teen now, and he certainly shows it. Really all he wants is an easier life. Plus to get the attention and heart of that one girl. I think he truly has the most character development of the entire cast. Making things right in the end with his dad and Roxanne.Pete/PJ Nice cameo characters, its also nice to see Pete and Goofy acting as better friends. PJ really hasn't changed much but these two truly have some of the best lines in the movie. One thing is I don't get why everyone's all confused on Pete's wife and daughter. He said in the store that he's taking PJ camping to strengthen the father/son bond. So its obvious that Peg and the girl are still at home doing their own thing.Roxanne Ahh that popular girl that steals the heart of Max. She seems like an interesting girl however she gets really little screen time, well not counting the visions Max keeps getting of her. I kinda wish she was in it more, so we could learn a bit more of her character. Well maybe if they do A Goofy Movie 3. Big Foot 3 words Funniest Character Ever!Music The Powerline songs really have to be my favorite. You don't hear R&B like this anymore. Of course I also like some of the instrumental pieces as well. Not to mention the "After Today" these songs really wanna make you dance more then just sing. I'm even thinking about getting the soundtrack.This movie really needs to be seen to get its true impact. Doesn't matter how old you are, hey I'm 17 and I think its great. So if your interested in a good family movie, or just want some humor and a good story, then this is the Disney movie for you.

In 2004 Walt Disney was announcing that was closing the Traditional Animation Department. Sixty years of paper animation, tradition and more than that, magic, was coming to end. "Home on the Range" became the last movie made with traditional animation. This notice was received by the longtime fans as a bomb. Claiming that the style was no longer attractive, Disney forgot the past and looked for the future. But it was not just the style that Disney leaves behind, but the soul as well. This review it's about a movie that belongs to the Disney Golden Age and focuses in a character loved by generations: the Goofy. The Goofy won his own series in the early of 1990 decade and also a son, Max. "Goofy Troop" made a great success with the kid and pre- teen public with creative stories and day by day situations. With the success, Disney decided to produce a movie focusing, only not in Goofy, but the relationship between him and his son that was not so developed on the series. But why I start this review talking about the Disney animation style? Just because "The Goofy Movie" it's that kind of film that Disney really doesn't can produce again, even with all the technology we have on these days. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie was premiered on April 7, 1995 (in Brazil, the movie premiered on July 21, 1995) and made a good presence on the cinema raising more than $ 6,000,000 of box office on the first weekend. As a sequel of the series, the original characters come again. Max has now 14 years old and wants his own life without his father causing shame with his goofy way. He likes a girl named Roxanne, but don't know how to talk with her, freezing when the girl is close. After create a problem on the school, Goofy is advised by the school principal that he have to rethink how he's raising his son. Worried, Goofy decide to save Max of the electric chair, taking him to fish. And then, begins a travel of self-know where father and son will rediscover the meaning of fraternity, trust and love, even if the son grows up, he'll still be a boy for his father. This is the focus of the movie that has a simple and linear screenplay. A moral message at the end and followed by musical sequences closes the production. There's something new on this film? No, absolutely nothing, but this is exactly what makes difference. Sometimes it's not necessary produce a movie full of special effects, action sequences and all of these things. Sometimes, just a good and familiar story, with a soundtrack that really stays on the memory and charismatic and memorable characters really makes difference. And talking about soundtrack, "A Goofy Movie" has an incredible and memorable musical sequences. Performances by Tevin Campbell, music as "Eye to Eye" (I2I) and "Stand Out" is really great. Others, more slowly and sentimental as "Nobody Else but You" sang by Max and Goofy together have its presence. The final sequence when Goofy and Max really seen that the relation between father and son can really be fun it's beautiful and the stage performance with Powerline it's awesome likewise! But "Stand out" really stand out on this film! Twenty years. But unfortunately twenty years make a great distance between generations. "A Goofy Movie" with all its moral lessons and animation style has no place with the kids of these days. If you want feels the nostalgia of the old days, "A Goofy Movie" it's a nice choice. About the new generation, tries to show this movie it's a good thing, but it's possible that the expectation may be frustrated. But make a try, its praiseworthy! Styles that Disney really has lost of decade that cannot be forget. This is "A Goofy Movie"!

Not one of Disney's best films and it bombed in the box office tho has become a cult fav. I enjoyed this film more when I was a kid and teen tho watching as an adult the plot is thin and annoying. Some of the songs are fun tho some are forgettable. Overall it's a forgettable Disney film tho it has its moments.

Max, the little eleven-year-old on Goof Troop, that's not him in this he's grown up, and this is not what I excpected, it's a rare movie they don't make often. The theme here is old-fashioned dad growing up in the 60's meets your typical 90's teenager. Max is a teenager in this movie after trying to impress Roxanne, the girl of his dreams by performing a Powerline concert with him without telling anybody, something that has great imagination. He gets busted and is threatened to get put in the electric chair so Goofy decides to take him on a fishing trip to Idaho. The films got great music that I enjoy listening to on tape. Max later changes the map so they can go to the Powerline concert in La cause he couldn't see it at the graduation party he had to miss. I can relate this movie to how we all fell sometimes as teenagers. Max is mean spiritted, and tries to avoid being around his dad, and is embarresed by him and slams him for being so old-fashioned and clueless to the teen culture. He evolves towards the end, and changes and is nicer and learns to appreciate and like being around his Goofy dad and except him. In one scence at the possum park Max almost says my life's a living hell but gets cut off by a possum which I got laughs from him decking the Chuckee Cheese like thing trying to Cheer him up in a geeky friendly way. The theme is an odd couple a 90's teen stuck with a goofy old-fashioned dad. This is one of the funniest, best Disney movies ever. There's plenty of slapstick comedy like on Goof Troop.

this first feature length film starring Goofy is not too bad.it has it's funny moments,to be sure.but it also gets a bit schmaltzy at times.and there are too many musical numbers for my taste.still,a couple of the songs are catchy.and though i didn't find it riotously funny,i will say there's e a scene near the end which is very funny.overall,though i'd say it's amusing straight through and certainly very entertaining.and there's even a lesson in it for the kids.it's worth the watch at least once,especially if you catch it on TV or as a cheap rental.whether it's worth a purchase or not is up to personal tastes.but for me,A Goofy Movie is a respectable 6/10

Goofy, a very famous character, was introduced in Mickey Mouse cartoons in the early 1930's, but finally got his own full-length film over sixty years later, this 1995 movie featuring characters from the short-lived early 90's TV show, "Goof Troop". I remember seeing some of "A Goofy Movie" in my school gymnasium within the next few years after its release, but never saw it all until 2007, when I decided to rent it. When I first watched this Disney feature from beginning to end, I thought it was very good around the beginning (what I had remembered seeing before) and went downhill after a while, but was good overall. Since then, nearly three years have passed, but I rented it again last week for another viewing, and it may have improved just slightly this time.On the last day of school before the summer holidays, Max Goof, the teenage son of Goofy Goof, has a crush on a girl at school named Roxanne, and wants to impress her. His friends, PJ and Bobby, help him put on an unexpected concert at the school assembly that day. This wows the students, including Roxanne, and makes Max popular with the school, but Principal Mazur is not happy about this interruption, and the three of them end up in his office. It appears Max has won the heart of Roxanne, as his love interest agrees to go to a party with him, where the attendees will get to see the Powerline concert in L.A on TV. However, Goofy receives a call from the principal, who exaggerates what Max did, and warns the Goof father that his son could end up in the electric chair if he doesn't change his ways! Obviously not wanting this to happen, Goofy decides to take his son on a summer fishing trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father/son bonding, which means Max won't get to attend the party. Before they leave town, the teenage Goof lies to Roxanne, telling her that his father is taking him to the Powerline concert, and he will be joining the artist onstage! The trip turns out to be horrible for Max with his father's antics and their conflicting personalities, and it obviously isn't likely that his girlfriend actually will be seeing him on TV at that party! I'm not sure what I think of the dream sequence at the beginning, but after that, it's usually pretty entertaining. There are occasional unsatisfactory gags, some around the beginning involving Bobby and his love for cheese, and the kid's "Dork and Dork Junior" comment at the possum-based amusement park is another low point (I don't know if that's supposed to be funny or not), but as a comedy, the film usually works. This is often because of the lovable Goofy's antics, and the funniest part might be the car radio scene. The animation and some of the characters also help the quality of the film, and the same goes for the well written story. None of the songs are among the Disney classics, but they are decent enough. As funny as "A Goofy Movie" can be, it's not all for laughs. The film eventually becomes touching, and it's a story with morals. Towards the end of my second viewing, I wasn't sure whether the feature was a 7/10 or 8/10 in my book, with all the things there are to like, and I'm still not sure.The release of this movie was followed later the same year by the release of another animated Disney feature, and sadly a far inferior one, "Pocahontas". "A Goofy Movie" cannot match "Beauty and the Beast", "Aladdin", or "The Lion King", three more popular 90's Disney flicks which preceded it, but it's much better than the company's other traditionally animated feature from 1995. I saw "Pocahontas" in the theatre, and even as a kid, I was not very impressed. Not much changed when I watched it again a couple of times, over a decade later. And yet, it seems more people have seen that mediocre film than "A Goofy Movie" (I didn't even know about this feature during its theatrical run), and I really think this earlier 1995 Disney release deserves more recognition. It's not a masterpiece and may be a bit more entertaining for kids than adults, but I think it still has enough for an adult viewer who likes this type of film.

A Goofy Movie ranks upon my top 5 favorites.  It gives an accurate representation of adolescent life in an uplifting, comedic, and often heartwarming fashion.  The animation is good, the songs are great, the screenplay is superb, the voices fit each character perfectly (Especially Max's.  Good job Mr. Marsden!) and many nice cinematic effects are included. This "kids" movie is a real treat to the older, and, at times is symbolic of deeper messages.  A real winner that should be in the hands of any Goofy, Disney, or movie fan, for that matter!

A Goofy Movie (1995) does feel like 90's Disney animated movies, but that is what is good about it. After rewatching this movie that I have not seen in a while, I still like this movie and how it is one of those Disney animated movies you remember over time.Goofy and his son Max are likable characters and have a good father and son relationship. The chemistry between Max and the love interest Roxanne was cute, and I like that they both are awkward leading to some cute moments of them interacting with each other.The animation is pretty and flows nicely with the backgrounds and the character movements. There are memorable moments and funny scenes with the characters, but they can also give serious and heartfelt moments between Goofy and Max.A Goofy Movie (1995) is a nice family movie. The movie also has some songs that are nice to listen to and look good in the movie with the animation, which will make this a funny, nice looking, heartfelt, and fun movie.

I never though that this movie would be any good, until I saw it on Cinema when I was little. I didn't remember this movie to be that good until I re-watched it as an adult.This movie capture the relation between father and son perfectly. On one side you have a typical child having a crush on a girl as he tries to act cool and draws her attention in every opportunity, and on the other side is the most uncool father a child would ever wish to have that could ruin his reputation in an instant. Max values "coolness" greatly and tries to sever any relation he has with his goofy bloodline (even though his bloodline is occasionally catching up to him in the form of embarrassing Goofyish trademark subconscious laughs). Goofy on the other hand is the caring father, that is oblivious of the worlds recent trends, have no idea what being cool is or how his action can damage his son's reputation, and believe that every experience he had at his younger years, will work just as well on his son. Thus begin an journey where Goofy will learn to respect his son and realize that not two people are the same, and Max will have to accept and learn to appreciate his father for what he is.Also worth to note is that there is no main villain in this movie. Disney's traditional antagonist Black Pit plays an important role, but he never does anything bad, he does't sabotage the heroes's goal in any way, he don't wish bad for them, he does't get punished in the end, he even tries to help the occasionally with advices that he thinks are good. His role in the story is to represent a different opinion of how a father should interact with his son, and even though he is presented as the bad example, there is no solid proof that his model is entirely wrong.This movie could had worked as well with any random cast of characters, but for some reason Disney threw goofy in those shoes, and that was both good and bad. On the good side, Goofy's recognizably goofy and slapstick personality fits perfectly the uncool father, without making him annoying to the viewer. On the bad side, most people thought of this movie as a long Goofy cartoon and it didn't get the recognition it deserves.The movie designed to entertain and teach equally to both the child and the parrent. You should give it a shot.

In the first half of the 1990s, the Disney Renaissance practically dominated the theatrical animation media, so everyone who went to see the latest animated Disney flick knew what they were getting with fantasy, fun filled heroes and Broadway musical numbers. This would make any alternative Disney flick stick out from the crowd, such as the holiday cult favorite Nightmare Before Christmas and the surprisingly upbeat and emotional romp A Goofy Movie. What could have just been another dated 1990s film for its time ended up lasting long enough to gain a huge cult following from those who grew up with it, and understandably so.The movie follows Goofy trying to take his rebellious teenage son Max on a fishing trip so that they don't drift away from one another, yet he's unintentionally interfering with Max's social life, particularly with his high school crush Roxanne. Conceptually, the film does have the typical liar subplot where the main character has to go through an arch by making stuff up due to unfortunate circumstances and the usual father-son relationship we've seen in other films. However, what saves the movie is the execution of said father-son relationship, as the feature focuses on the pros and cons of Goofy and Max, not one specifically. You relate to Max not wanting to go on such a befuddling trip, but you also feel bad for Goofy due to his concern for Max's well being. As the road trip takes up most of the run time, it develops the nutty dad and rockstar son's relationship through crazy antics and heartfelt camaraderie. Whether it means encountering Bigfoot, getting stuck in the water or ending up in a rock & roll concert, this just may be one of the most unpredictable father-son bonds in cinema history.In addition to a heartfelt relationship, the film knows when to have fun with itself, especially during the musical numbers. After Today in particular does a swell job establishing Max's status at his high school and the students there as whole through high spirited dances and catchy lyrics any high schooler can relate to. Most of the other songs keep the story going while showcasing highly creative choreography and elaborate set pieces, especially On the Open Road and Nobody Else But You, with the one exception being Lester's Possum Park being more a funny filler quip. If there's any musical show stopper, it would have to be Eye to Eye, as it displays the coolest dance sequences, the highest amount of energy, and an amazing blend of lights and shadows. Speaking of all that technical stuff, the film's animation is more fluid and smooth than it could have been. The character animation brings the already cartoony designs to life through specific acting, the backgrounds are neatly colored without looking too saturated, and the mixes of cel shaded CGI blend in to the point of barely noticing.Another added bonus is the voice acting, especially from Goofy's voice Bill Farmer. As legendary as Pinto Colvig was, Farmer brought both the lovable goofball side to the character and a deep amount of emotive pathos that no one had ever seen before from such a famed comic star. In addition, Jason Marsden brings a good amount of cynicism and dorkiness to Max, Jim Cummings is delightfully hammy yet also menacingly cunning as Pete, Rob Paulsen really knows how to dumb-down PJ with his naive worrisome demeanor, and both Kellie Martin and Jenna von Oy are charmingly quirky as Roxanne and Stacey. Also, to anyone who cannot stand Pauley Shore, this may be the only movie he's been in where his laid-back slacker lingo fits given how much of a degenerate Bobby is (seriously, who eats THAT much cheese whizz in one gulp?). Wallace Shawn as well, despite what little screen time his character has, plays a great role in setting the record straight to Goofy on what to do with his bizarre son. Among a cast of others from hysterical children, to janky possum animatronics, the aforementioned Bigfoot and a Tevin Campbell performed pop star celebrity are some of the most fascinatingly hysterical characters in the Disney feature collection.The most unfortunate thing about A Goofy Movie is that most critics unfairly compared it to the higher bar Disney features at the time, which in turn led it to be discarded for many years until its cult following grew into mainstream recognition. Sure the film may be outlandish, but who would want it any other way? It's dated and timeless in all the right ways for its awesome music, nostalgic throwbacks, deep routed themes on parental and offspring growth and continuing Goofy's legacy with respect and silliness. As the film said perfectly, one way or another, if we listen to each other's heart, we'll find that we're never too far apart.

I'll get it out of the way - this film is the most mid-90s thing I have ever seen. The fashions, music, language and animation style are like a veritable time capsule. If I had watched this as a child, I probably would have liked it. I can see a lot to like about it - the scenes are exciting, the protagonist is relatable and his relationship with his father is emotionally engaging. However, there is too much that lets it down. The pacing and plot are very scattershot with a very jumpy feeling that never really focuses on one thing. Most importantly, the plot progression gives the rather dubious impression that dishonesty ultimately pays off, undermining the supposed heroism of the protagonist.

Perfect, it's cartoon. The music is awesome. It's perfect, funny, and clever. A must see even though your not a fan of Disney or cartoons this one just pulls you right in. Max is such a cool kids. It gives a good message. It tells you how some people act. How lying is bad. How there are consequence's for your action. You have to watch this movie even though your not a Disney fan or you are just not into cartoons. Is good for both teens and children of any age. Adults will find it suitable. Just please go out and rent this movie. Its So Funny. I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 stars. I will never ever let so one borrow my VHS because a movie this good must be valuable one day.

When Max makes an preposterous promise to a girl he has a crush on, his chances to fulfilling it seem hopeless when he is dragged onto a cross-country trip with his embarrassing father, Goofy.Goofy was always a secondary character, ranking behind Mickey and Donald, as well as Minnie. He edges out Daisy, but that's only because she has never really been developed. But with "Goofy Movie", he finally gets his due, even if he still has to be second fiddle to his son. (The movie conveniently ignores how Goofy had a son.) The film is fun, and really captures the 1990s. This is both a strength (nostalgia) and a weakness (Pauly Shore). What is odd is that I think we are supposed to identify with Max, but we actually identify more with Goofy himself, as Max comes off as rude, boastful and disrespectful.

I don't like This movie. Goof is so not funny. Max too

This is one of the best Disney films I have seen. If you are young, you will fully identify with the characters, and if you're not so young, this film will make you remember many things you left behind. The expression of the characters is sensational, the music is very good, the screenplay is fantastic, and there are lots of intelligent cinematography effects used. I find it a little short, but I'm sure that children will appreciate that (as far as I can remember, I never was able to watch a long movie when I was a child). My final rating is 8-9 out of 10.

I do not see why this isn't on the Disney classics list. It is well animated, well scripted, heartwarming and it has better songs than many other Disney films. It deals with Goofy taking his son Max out on a road trip after Max sabotages an assembly. Meanwhile Max wants to stay so he can go to his favorite singer's concert and go out with his crush from school Roxanne. When compared to almost every other Disney cartoon, this one has more emotion. You feel genuinely sad or happy when Goofy and Max are getting along, or when Goofy is trying. I actually felt sad when Max gets mad at Goofy for taking him to the Possom show. It's a great movie, and I highly recommend any fan of animation find it.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****.

Goofy has always been one of my most favorite Disney characters and I always found it a shame he had no feature length film (like Mickey Mouse whom I really do not like that much). In 1995 though Goofy got his feature length film, but it took me until now to see it. It was not for rent here, but I was lucky enough to catch an English spoken version on it on German TV (films on German TV are usually overdubbed in German) so I was very happy to have caught it. I was not let down, neither by Disney, nor by Goofy. The movie was not as good as the Disney movies who are targeted for big audiences, but I still liked it quite a lot. The story was pretty realistic and good, there were enough laughs, but also some emotional' moments. All in all, something of everything and something for everybody. From me, that gets a:
7 out of 10

This one seemed to pass without notice in the theaters which is what I figured it deserved, but upon seeing it some time later on video I was surprised at how much fun this buddies on the road flick really is. 
Goofy is, for the most part, the lighthearted walking disaster we'd expect him to be.  But surprsingly enough, he shows a serious range of emotion, and actually pulls it off.  You really can sense his devotion to his son, Max, and you never have to remind yourself that Goofy would have ever been anything but a deeply caring father. It just works naturally as a genuine extension of his gregarious character.  Max himself is believably adoloscent, primarily concerned with getting asked to parties and getting the pretty girl to notice him and hoping his father doesn't publicly humiliate him (which he does, frequently), until his dad forces him along on a fishing trip which becomes a test of conscience for the both of them.  The movie mixes Goofy's classic slapstick comedy with serious drama and seems to know just when to switch gears to keep from getting too melodramatic or losing sight of the conflict at the center of the story.  In the end, the dramatic bits feel surprisingly honest and human and the comedy is, as I said, classic Goofy schtick.  It was made when Disney thought EVERYthing they did had to be a musical, but the songs here work into the story fairly easily, and a couple are even catchy.The only sad part is that the age group which could probably stand to learn the most from it will unequivocally find it "uncool".  Oh well, the younger set as well as more mature people who love to laugh will find it plenty entertaining.

Having grown up watching it, it's one of my personal favorite kid movies of the 1990's. If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves. I have to admit, it was probably this movie that convinced me to come out of my shell and made the rest of my life more enjoyable and memorable. I have to say the humor works, physical slapstick, and jokes. Some of its jokes are pretty out there like odd breaking the fourth wall humor. I loved the Lester's possum park. I don't know if it was making fun of Disneyland or not, but it was funny. Always made me laugh. This always reminded me of Chuck E. Cheese. The big foot scene was hilarious as well. The supporting cast work even Pauley Shore as Max's friend, Bobby. I'm just glad, he had a small role. Good to see Jim Cummings voicing Pete. He is a voice actor legend. The animation was pretty OK, it wasn't catchy. It look like animation, you give a TV show, not a full length animation movie. The title also is kinda wrong. It's not a Goofy movie, but a movie about Max. Goofy only plays a supporting role in the film. Kinda like a second banana. I do have to say the movie have a musical like theme throughout the film. I love every song in the film. After Today is 'The Part of your world' emotional ballad for the Disney teenager male setting the table type song that mostly sang by Disney heroines. The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. "On the Open Road" and 'Nobody Else But You" are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out. The second uses a much more cliché theme of old vs. new, and though it does work and is interesting, never goes the extra mile to address anything of true importance. So I like this movie, better. Overall: There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me. It had an old concept, the buddy/father-son/coming-of-age adolescence film. But it did it in just a very fresh, very appealing way for me.

Max is constantly embarrassed by his father, Goofy. Now considering that Goofy is a complete idiot and major dork, you can understand Max's feelings about this. But Max is no prize either...he's a teenager!! Plus, to impress a girl, he lies and says that he's friends with a famous singer and will be at the big concert in Los Angeles. The film is about their road trip across America...and Goofy has no idea that Max wants to go to the concert. So, instead, he's planned a LOT of lame vacation stops....all the types to make teens cringe.I really liked "A Goofy Movie" but cannot see giving it a score higher than 7. The reasons were that the movie featured Pauly Shore as one of Max's friends....and frankly, ANY Pauly Shore in a movie is too much. Additionally, the film simply was an extension of the television show...and looked much like a TV show. But, on the positive side, it really, really had a lot of heart and had a lot of real issues in the film--such as a father having a hard time letting his son grow up as well as how tough it is to be a teen...with all that angst, uncertainty and goofiness. Well worth seeing...warts and all.

When I grew up I watched A Goofy Movie ritually, and it never ceased to entertain me. This is a great children's film and can still relate to today's kids. The humor is enjoyable, the characters are lovable. The music is definitely bearable, whereas with most musical animated films the songs can really grate on the nerves. Perhaps it's just because I practically was raised on this film that I enjoy it so much, but I have given it to my little brother and he loves it as well. It's a great experience for any kid and shouldn't be missed. It's even a little fun for adults, and I am not ashamed to say I still enjoy it as well. A Disney classic! 10/10

When it comes to animated cartoon features, the delineating line is now almost as simple as "pre-Toy Story" and "post-Toy Story". Before that Disney-Pixar team-up cartoons in theaters were for kids and kids alone. Young kids, at that. What Toy Story proved, however, is that an animated flick could transcend that boundary and appeal to adults as well as children.Just 6-7 or so scant months before Toy Story changed everything, A Goofy Movie premiered and largely got "lost in the shuffle", I believe. Had it dropped a bit later, perhaps it could have better captured the momentum. As it was, A Goofy Movie transfixed pre-teen adolescent audiences--including yours truly--for a (very) short time with its odd-yet-winning mix of music, humor, family relationships, and shenanigans.For a basic plot summary, this story tells the story of Max (Jason Marsden), son of the infamous Goofy (Bill Farmer), going through his adolescence. Despite being extremely self-conscious of his appearance and gulp-like chuckle, he strives to win the attention of Roxanne (Kellie Martin). Just when things seem to be looking up on that front, Dad Goofy decides to take him on a weeks-long, father-son fishing excursion across the country. Max promises Roxanne he's going to the Driveline concert--the most popular band ever!--setting himself up for a tangled web of decisions and emotions out on the open road with Pops.I know it sounds ridiculous considering this a cartoon starring Goofy, but I honestly believe this little film (about 78 minutes in total) could be watched 100 years from now and still have the same effect on viewers. I truly don't think this is a case of me suffering from "90s nostalgia" and rating this film higher because "I liked it as a kid".The beginning of the film feels very much High School Musical-esque, with teen drama taking center stage. I don't care if it's 1995 or 2025, the concept of awkward teen boy trying to talk to/impress equally awkward teen girl is universal. The same can be said for when Max and Goofy hit the road together, as the tenuous relationship between pre-teen son and goofball father is once again ageless. Whether through great writing/directing or pure dumb luck, this movie stumbles upon a gold mine of relevant themes.Like I said, if only Disney knew what they potential had at this point. No self-respecting adult would have willingly sat through this in theaters at the time (there was no precedent for that), and Disney had not yet figured out how to market such fare to wide audiences either. As a result, the movie gets sucked into a sort of "black hole" of quality content that had an extremely short shelf life.The bottom line, though, is this: I watched A Goofy Movie while I was still in grade school and loved it. I watched it as a 33-year old adult...and still enjoyed it. All things considered, I view that as a remarkable achievement. Sadly, only those within a year or two (at most) proximity to myself will have any real knowledge/appreciation of this movie, but that set will show it to their children at some point, I can almost guarantee you that!

OK, I'm a grown up man and I love this movie. I know I have kids but shouldn't I want to watch grown up films? Maybe this is actually just a good movie that adults and kids alike can enjoy.This is a well underrated full-length cartoon movie about Goofy taking his son Max camping for the summer vacation. You know what Goofy is like from his appearances in Mickey Mouse films and the name Goofy sums it up. To make things more interesting, Max is wanting to be the cool kid in school and his dad is an embarrassment.The trek across the States in Goofy's little car and all the madcap things that happen to them reminded me of the original "Vacation" film only for kids and a little funnier.The music in this film is excellent. Some of the tracks could have been singles in the charts in their own right. Maybe not nowadays though.If you have kids then they will love this film. If you don't have kids go to the video shop, hire it out and pretend it is for the kids.

Believe it or not, this is a good movie. It's kinda weird... but in a good way. The music in this movie kinda sucks, but that's my biggest complaint.

I remember seeing this cartoon film from Walt Disney Pictures at least once when I was younger, but for some reason I forced myself into watching it again when grown up, probably just to get a definite opinion, but I knew it was going to be terrible no matter what. Basically school has ended and summer has begun, teenage Max Goof (Jason Marsden) wants to catch the eye of beautiful fellow student Roxanne (Kellie Martin), so he stages an impromptu concert at the final assembly. Max's father Goofy (Bill Farmer) gets a call from Principal Mazur (Toy Story's Wallace Shawn), he exaggerates events and warns that if Max's actions may one day have him facing capital punishment, Goofy has the idea to get Max away from everything by taking him on vacation. Max has succeeded becoming a celebrity and impressing Roxanne, she agrees to go to a party where a live performance by pop singer Powerline will be showing, but then Goofy blows his plans announcing they are going on a fishing trip together in his station wagon, following a map route to Lake Destiny, Idaho. Max is forced to call off the date with Roxanne, but he fabricates a story that his father knows Powerline and tells her that he will be with the pop star when they go live on stage at the concert. Max is miserable throughout the journey to go fishing, Pete (Jim Cummings) and his son and Max's friend P.J. (Rob Paulsen) join them on the way, Pete advises Goofy to keep Max under control, and of course, with Goofy around, the trip is full of disasters, including spending the night with Bigfoot (Scooby-Doo's Frank Welker). Stopping during the journey at night Max alters the route map to change the destination to Los Angeles, where the concert is being held, Goofy decides in the morning to make Max navigator, and allow them to stop along the way wherever he chooses. Pete on one of their stops overhears Max and P.J. talking about Max's change to the map, he tells Goofy, but he refuses to believe him, but looking at the map for himself he knows he has been duped. Goofy gets very angry when Max directs him towards California instead of Idaho, they fight and end up with the car crashing into the river, but they survive, they reconcile and Goofy understands Max wanting to impress a girl he feels for, and Max saves his dad from a waterfall death using a fishing technique he taught him. Goofy and Max make it to Los Angeles and the concert, through unintentional gatecrashing they both end up dancing on stage with Powerline during his performance, watched by everyone from school, including Roxanne. In the end, after returning home, Max tells Roxanne the truth, but she admits she always had feelings for him, since he said "Ahyuck!" (the Goofy laugh), they start a relationship, the car explodes and Goody falls through the house roof, this allows Max to introduce Roxanne to his dad. Also starring Kevin Lima as Lester, Florence Stanley as Waitress and Jo Anne Worley as Miss Maples. The film is essentially a film adaptation of the TV show Goof Troop (which I watched sometimes younger and liked), but with the kid character now a teenager, Goofy in this is unfortunately not suited as a dad, his chaotic antics are not as fun to watch as the original shorts from the past, in fact in this I found him highly irritating, and his teen son with an attitude is no better. In fact the entire film was irritating, only creating titters of laughs, and the most predictable and ordinary story, I knew it was going to be terrible, and it was, not one I'd even bother showing your children, a rather rubbish animated comedy. Pretty poor!

I remember the old Goof Troop show when I was a kid. It was fun but perhaps a too well " Goofy" for me now. It was a cartoon after all, and when I heard about this movie I thought this would be the same. Boy was I wrong.This movie truly reaches out for kids, teens, and adults. The whole plot revolves around Max trying to get the girl, making a name for himself, and well not trying to be a complete Goof. So he does what all kids in real life do, well more or less. Basicaly he holds a little surprise concert in the middle of an assembly, with him starring as the schools favorite singer Powerline. Well he gets Roxanne's attention, but also that of his father who thinks maybe he should spend a little more time with his son, making sure Max will turn out to be a good kid.(The characters)Goofy Its good seeing Goofy trying to be a real parent. To me in Goof troop he was more like Max's older friend. Though Goofy doesn't seem to be as goofy as he was on the old cartoons, this shows something of a better side him. Trying to be a good father, who just wants to be part of his son's life.Max Well he's a teen now, and he certainly shows it. Really all he wants is an easier life. Plus to get the attention and heart of that one girl. I think he truly has the most character development of the entire cast. Making things right in the end with his dad and Roxanne.Pete/PJ Nice cameo characters, its also nice to see Pete and Goofy acting as better friends. PJ really hasn't changed much but these two truly have some of the best lines in the movie. One thing is I don't get why everyone's all confused on Pete's wife and daughter. He said in the store that he's taking PJ camping to strengthen the father/son bond. So its obvious that Peg and the girl are still at home doing their own thing.Roxanne Ahh that popular girl that steals the heart of Max. She seems like an interesting girl however she gets really little screen time, well not counting the visions Max keeps getting of her. I kinda wish she was in it more, so we could learn a bit more of her character. Well maybe if they do A Goofy Movie 3. Big Foot 3 words Funniest Character Ever!Music The Powerline songs really have to be my favorite. You don't hear R&B like this anymore. Of course I also like some of the instrumental pieces as well. Not to mention the "After Today" these songs really wanna make you dance more then just sing. I'm even thinking about getting the soundtrack.This movie really needs to be seen to get its true impact. Doesn't matter how old you are, hey I'm 17 and I think its great. So if your interested in a good family movie, or just want some humor and a good story, then this is the Disney movie for you.

In 2004 Walt Disney was announcing that was closing the Traditional Animation Department. Sixty years of paper animation, tradition and more than that, magic, was coming to end. "Home on the Range" became the last movie made with traditional animation. This notice was received by the longtime fans as a bomb. Claiming that the style was no longer attractive, Disney forgot the past and looked for the future. But it was not just the style that Disney leaves behind, but the soul as well. This review it's about a movie that belongs to the Disney Golden Age and focuses in a character loved by generations: the Goofy. The Goofy won his own series in the early of 1990 decade and also a son, Max. "Goofy Troop" made a great success with the kid and pre- teen public with creative stories and day by day situations. With the success, Disney decided to produce a movie focusing, only not in Goofy, but the relationship between him and his son that was not so developed on the series. But why I start this review talking about the Disney animation style? Just because "The Goofy Movie" it's that kind of film that Disney really doesn't can produce again, even with all the technology we have on these days. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie was premiered on April 7, 1995 (in Brazil, the movie premiered on July 21, 1995) and made a good presence on the cinema raising more than $ 6,000,000 of box office on the first weekend. As a sequel of the series, the original characters come again. Max has now 14 years old and wants his own life without his father causing shame with his goofy way. He likes a girl named Roxanne, but don't know how to talk with her, freezing when the girl is close. After create a problem on the school, Goofy is advised by the school principal that he have to rethink how he's raising his son. Worried, Goofy decide to save Max of the electric chair, taking him to fish. And then, begins a travel of self-know where father and son will rediscover the meaning of fraternity, trust and love, even if the son grows up, he'll still be a boy for his father. This is the focus of the movie that has a simple and linear screenplay. A moral message at the end and followed by musical sequences closes the production. There's something new on this film? No, absolutely nothing, but this is exactly what makes difference. Sometimes it's not necessary produce a movie full of special effects, action sequences and all of these things. Sometimes, just a good and familiar story, with a soundtrack that really stays on the memory and charismatic and memorable characters really makes difference. And talking about soundtrack, "A Goofy Movie" has an incredible and memorable musical sequences. Performances by Tevin Campbell, music as "Eye to Eye" (I2I) and "Stand Out" is really great. Others, more slowly and sentimental as "Nobody Else but You" sang by Max and Goofy together have its presence. The final sequence when Goofy and Max really seen that the relation between father and son can really be fun it's beautiful and the stage performance with Powerline it's awesome likewise! But "Stand out" really stand out on this film! Twenty years. But unfortunately twenty years make a great distance between generations. "A Goofy Movie" with all its moral lessons and animation style has no place with the kids of these days. If you want feels the nostalgia of the old days, "A Goofy Movie" it's a nice choice. About the new generation, tries to show this movie it's a good thing, but it's possible that the expectation may be frustrated. But make a try, its praiseworthy! Styles that Disney really has lost of decade that cannot be forget. This is "A Goofy Movie"!

Not one of Disney's best films and it bombed in the box office tho has become a cult fav. I enjoyed this film more when I was a kid and teen tho watching as an adult the plot is thin and annoying. Some of the songs are fun tho some are forgettable. Overall it's a forgettable Disney film tho it has its moments.

Max, the little eleven-year-old on Goof Troop, that's not him in this he's grown up, and this is not what I excpected, it's a rare movie they don't make often. The theme here is old-fashioned dad growing up in the 60's meets your typical 90's teenager. Max is a teenager in this movie after trying to impress Roxanne, the girl of his dreams by performing a Powerline concert with him without telling anybody, something that has great imagination. He gets busted and is threatened to get put in the electric chair so Goofy decides to take him on a fishing trip to Idaho. The films got great music that I enjoy listening to on tape. Max later changes the map so they can go to the Powerline concert in La cause he couldn't see it at the graduation party he had to miss. I can relate this movie to how we all fell sometimes as teenagers. Max is mean spiritted, and tries to avoid being around his dad, and is embarresed by him and slams him for being so old-fashioned and clueless to the teen culture. He evolves towards the end, and changes and is nicer and learns to appreciate and like being around his Goofy dad and except him. In one scence at the possum park Max almost says my life's a living hell but gets cut off by a possum which I got laughs from him decking the Chuckee Cheese like thing trying to Cheer him up in a geeky friendly way. The theme is an odd couple a 90's teen stuck with a goofy old-fashioned dad. This is one of the funniest, best Disney movies ever. There's plenty of slapstick comedy like on Goof Troop.

this first feature length film starring Goofy is not too bad.it has it's funny moments,to be sure.but it also gets a bit schmaltzy at times.and there are too many musical numbers for my taste.still,a couple of the songs are catchy.and though i didn't find it riotously funny,i will say there's e a scene near the end which is very funny.overall,though i'd say it's amusing straight through and certainly very entertaining.and there's even a lesson in it for the kids.it's worth the watch at least once,especially if you catch it on TV or as a cheap rental.whether it's worth a purchase or not is up to personal tastes.but for me,A Goofy Movie is a respectable 6/10

Goofy, a very famous character, was introduced in Mickey Mouse cartoons in the early 1930's, but finally got his own full-length film over sixty years later, this 1995 movie featuring characters from the short-lived early 90's TV show, "Goof Troop". I remember seeing some of "A Goofy Movie" in my school gymnasium within the next few years after its release, but never saw it all until 2007, when I decided to rent it. When I first watched this Disney feature from beginning to end, I thought it was very good around the beginning (what I had remembered seeing before) and went downhill after a while, but was good overall. Since then, nearly three years have passed, but I rented it again last week for another viewing, and it may have improved just slightly this time.On the last day of school before the summer holidays, Max Goof, the teenage son of Goofy Goof, has a crush on a girl at school named Roxanne, and wants to impress her. His friends, PJ and Bobby, help him put on an unexpected concert at the school assembly that day. This wows the students, including Roxanne, and makes Max popular with the school, but Principal Mazur is not happy about this interruption, and the three of them end up in his office. It appears Max has won the heart of Roxanne, as his love interest agrees to go to a party with him, where the attendees will get to see the Powerline concert in L.A on TV. However, Goofy receives a call from the principal, who exaggerates what Max did, and warns the Goof father that his son could end up in the electric chair if he doesn't change his ways! Obviously not wanting this to happen, Goofy decides to take his son on a summer fishing trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father/son bonding, which means Max won't get to attend the party. Before they leave town, the teenage Goof lies to Roxanne, telling her that his father is taking him to the Powerline concert, and he will be joining the artist onstage! The trip turns out to be horrible for Max with his father's antics and their conflicting personalities, and it obviously isn't likely that his girlfriend actually will be seeing him on TV at that party! I'm not sure what I think of the dream sequence at the beginning, but after that, it's usually pretty entertaining. There are occasional unsatisfactory gags, some around the beginning involving Bobby and his love for cheese, and the kid's "Dork and Dork Junior" comment at the possum-based amusement park is another low point (I don't know if that's supposed to be funny or not), but as a comedy, the film usually works. This is often because of the lovable Goofy's antics, and the funniest part might be the car radio scene. The animation and some of the characters also help the quality of the film, and the same goes for the well written story. None of the songs are among the Disney classics, but they are decent enough. As funny as "A Goofy Movie" can be, it's not all for laughs. The film eventually becomes touching, and it's a story with morals. Towards the end of my second viewing, I wasn't sure whether the feature was a 7/10 or 8/10 in my book, with all the things there are to like, and I'm still not sure.The release of this movie was followed later the same year by the release of another animated Disney feature, and sadly a far inferior one, "Pocahontas". "A Goofy Movie" cannot match "Beauty and the Beast", "Aladdin", or "The Lion King", three more popular 90's Disney flicks which preceded it, but it's much better than the company's other traditionally animated feature from 1995. I saw "Pocahontas" in the theatre, and even as a kid, I was not very impressed. Not much changed when I watched it again a couple of times, over a decade later. And yet, it seems more people have seen that mediocre film than "A Goofy Movie" (I didn't even know about this feature during its theatrical run), and I really think this earlier 1995 Disney release deserves more recognition. It's not a masterpiece and may be a bit more entertaining for kids than adults, but I think it still has enough for an adult viewer who likes this type of film.

A Goofy Movie ranks upon my top 5 favorites.  It gives an accurate representation of adolescent life in an uplifting, comedic, and often heartwarming fashion.  The animation is good, the songs are great, the screenplay is superb, the voices fit each character perfectly (Especially Max's.  Good job Mr. Marsden!) and many nice cinematic effects are included. This "kids" movie is a real treat to the older, and, at times is symbolic of deeper messages.  A real winner that should be in the hands of any Goofy, Disney, or movie fan, for that matter!

A Goofy Movie (1995) does feel like 90's Disney animated movies, but that is what is good about it. After rewatching this movie that I have not seen in a while, I still like this movie and how it is one of those Disney animated movies you remember over time.Goofy and his son Max are likable characters and have a good father and son relationship. The chemistry between Max and the love interest Roxanne was cute, and I like that they both are awkward leading to some cute moments of them interacting with each other.The animation is pretty and flows nicely with the backgrounds and the character movements. There are memorable moments and funny scenes with the characters, but they can also give serious and heartfelt moments between Goofy and Max.A Goofy Movie (1995) is a nice family movie. The movie also has some songs that are nice to listen to and look good in the movie with the animation, which will make this a funny, nice looking, heartfelt, and fun movie.

I never though that this movie would be any good, until I saw it on Cinema when I was little. I didn't remember this movie to be that good until I re-watched it as an adult.This movie capture the relation between father and son perfectly. On one side you have a typical child having a crush on a girl as he tries to act cool and draws her attention in every opportunity, and on the other side is the most uncool father a child would ever wish to have that could ruin his reputation in an instant. Max values "coolness" greatly and tries to sever any relation he has with his goofy bloodline (even though his bloodline is occasionally catching up to him in the form of embarrassing Goofyish trademark subconscious laughs). Goofy on the other hand is the caring father, that is oblivious of the worlds recent trends, have no idea what being cool is or how his action can damage his son's reputation, and believe that every experience he had at his younger years, will work just as well on his son. Thus begin an journey where Goofy will learn to respect his son and realize that not two people are the same, and Max will have to accept and learn to appreciate his father for what he is.Also worth to note is that there is no main villain in this movie. Disney's traditional antagonist Black Pit plays an important role, but he never does anything bad, he does't sabotage the heroes's goal in any way, he don't wish bad for them, he does't get punished in the end, he even tries to help the occasionally with advices that he thinks are good. His role in the story is to represent a different opinion of how a father should interact with his son, and even though he is presented as the bad example, there is no solid proof that his model is entirely wrong.This movie could had worked as well with any random cast of characters, but for some reason Disney threw goofy in those shoes, and that was both good and bad. On the good side, Goofy's recognizably goofy and slapstick personality fits perfectly the uncool father, without making him annoying to the viewer. On the bad side, most people thought of this movie as a long Goofy cartoon and it didn't get the recognition it deserves.The movie designed to entertain and teach equally to both the child and the parrent. You should give it a shot.

In the first half of the 1990s, the Disney Renaissance practically dominated the theatrical animation media, so everyone who went to see the latest animated Disney flick knew what they were getting with fantasy, fun filled heroes and Broadway musical numbers. This would make any alternative Disney flick stick out from the crowd, such as the holiday cult favorite Nightmare Before Christmas and the surprisingly upbeat and emotional romp A Goofy Movie. What could have just been another dated 1990s film for its time ended up lasting long enough to gain a huge cult following from those who grew up with it, and understandably so.The movie follows Goofy trying to take his rebellious teenage son Max on a fishing trip so that they don't drift away from one another, yet he's unintentionally interfering with Max's social life, particularly with his high school crush Roxanne. Conceptually, the film does have the typical liar subplot where the main character has to go through an arch by making stuff up due to unfortunate circumstances and the usual father-son relationship we've seen in other films. However, what saves the movie is the execution of said father-son relationship, as the feature focuses on the pros and cons of Goofy and Max, not one specifically. You relate to Max not wanting to go on such a befuddling trip, but you also feel bad for Goofy due to his concern for Max's well being. As the road trip takes up most of the run time, it develops the nutty dad and rockstar son's relationship through crazy antics and heartfelt camaraderie. Whether it means encountering Bigfoot, getting stuck in the water or ending up in a rock & roll concert, this just may be one of the most unpredictable father-son bonds in cinema history.In addition to a heartfelt relationship, the film knows when to have fun with itself, especially during the musical numbers. After Today in particular does a swell job establishing Max's status at his high school and the students there as whole through high spirited dances and catchy lyrics any high schooler can relate to. Most of the other songs keep the story going while showcasing highly creative choreography and elaborate set pieces, especially On the Open Road and Nobody Else But You, with the one exception being Lester's Possum Park being more a funny filler quip. If there's any musical show stopper, it would have to be Eye to Eye, as it displays the coolest dance sequences, the highest amount of energy, and an amazing blend of lights and shadows. Speaking of all that technical stuff, the film's animation is more fluid and smooth than it could have been. The character animation brings the already cartoony designs to life through specific acting, the backgrounds are neatly colored without looking too saturated, and the mixes of cel shaded CGI blend in to the point of barely noticing.Another added bonus is the voice acting, especially from Goofy's voice Bill Farmer. As legendary as Pinto Colvig was, Farmer brought both the lovable goofball side to the character and a deep amount of emotive pathos that no one had ever seen before from such a famed comic star. In addition, Jason Marsden brings a good amount of cynicism and dorkiness to Max, Jim Cummings is delightfully hammy yet also menacingly cunning as Pete, Rob Paulsen really knows how to dumb-down PJ with his naive worrisome demeanor, and both Kellie Martin and Jenna von Oy are charmingly quirky as Roxanne and Stacey. Also, to anyone who cannot stand Pauley Shore, this may be the only movie he's been in where his laid-back slacker lingo fits given how much of a degenerate Bobby is (seriously, who eats THAT much cheese whizz in one gulp?). Wallace Shawn as well, despite what little screen time his character has, plays a great role in setting the record straight to Goofy on what to do with his bizarre son. Among a cast of others from hysterical children, to janky possum animatronics, the aforementioned Bigfoot and a Tevin Campbell performed pop star celebrity are some of the most fascinatingly hysterical characters in the Disney feature collection.The most unfortunate thing about A Goofy Movie is that most critics unfairly compared it to the higher bar Disney features at the time, which in turn led it to be discarded for many years until its cult following grew into mainstream recognition. Sure the film may be outlandish, but who would want it any other way? It's dated and timeless in all the right ways for its awesome music, nostalgic throwbacks, deep routed themes on parental and offspring growth and continuing Goofy's legacy with respect and silliness. As the film said perfectly, one way or another, if we listen to each other's heart, we'll find that we're never too far apart.

I'll get it out of the way - this film is the most mid-90s thing I have ever seen. The fashions, music, language and animation style are like a veritable time capsule. If I had watched this as a child, I probably would have liked it. I can see a lot to like about it - the scenes are exciting, the protagonist is relatable and his relationship with his father is emotionally engaging. However, there is too much that lets it down. The pacing and plot are very scattershot with a very jumpy feeling that never really focuses on one thing. Most importantly, the plot progression gives the rather dubious impression that dishonesty ultimately pays off, undermining the supposed heroism of the protagonist.

Perfect, it's cartoon. The music is awesome. It's perfect, funny, and clever. A must see even though your not a fan of Disney or cartoons this one just pulls you right in. Max is such a cool kids. It gives a good message. It tells you how some people act. How lying is bad. How there are consequence's for your action. You have to watch this movie even though your not a Disney fan or you are just not into cartoons. Is good for both teens and children of any age. Adults will find it suitable. Just please go out and rent this movie. Its So Funny. I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 stars. I will never ever let so one borrow my VHS because a movie this good must be valuable one day.

SO this was on TV today on Five and I actually thought it wasn't that bad. The movie is about Goofy's son Max who is in love with a girl called Roxanne and wants to impress her as he wants to go and see Powerline the concert,but his dad Goofy(voiced by Bill Farmer) wants Max to spend some time with him so they end up going on a trip together to spend some time doing fishing. Of course Max doesn't want to and so he makes Goofy bring him to the Powerline concert so that he can be with Roxanne who will also attend the show. (Powerline is like Micheal Jackson if you don't know who he is). But will Max go to see Powerline or will he spend some time with his father and not go to Los Angelus to go and see the concert.The movie has a very 80s vibe about it even though its made in 1995. The animation is nice and the story was great too. Is it the best animated movie of all time well not really but I haven't seen that movie in ages until today so it was nice to go back to my childhood.Overall its a 6

I don't like This movie. Goof is so not funny. Max too
