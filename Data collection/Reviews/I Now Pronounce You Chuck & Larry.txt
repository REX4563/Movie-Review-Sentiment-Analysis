LOL Rob Schneider playing a stereotypical asian, everyone using the f-word for gay -- this is one offensive movie -- but damn, if it isn't refreshing seeing something as obscene as this these days.Everything is so stuck up and cringey and bad but taking itself seriously these days... that a movie like this, that's nothing too special but an average early 2000s comedy felt fresh AF.It's pretty funny, has some good friendship moments, wholesome moments, offensive moments... I don't know, I kinda liked it. Like I said, it's a breath of fresh air now, eventhough in its day it was probably nothing too shocking.I sympathize with gay dudes, because I can imagine how difficult it must be to admit you are one in a world where men are expected to adhere to standards that society pretends aren't there anymore but they are. So this movie also raises some good questions for the viewers. It's actually anything but dumb and offensive, it's pretty thought provoking.

This film is basically an average comedy. You can poke a lot of holes in the plot and there is a lot of stupidity. Yet, there are some parts that make you laugh out loud. This is an entertaining film, but your own sense of humor should dictate whether you want to see it or not.Sandler and James play New York firefighters. The basic premise is that Kevin James' character finds a loophole in the system so that if he marries Sandler, his children will easily get his employee benefits. Without a wife, his children would be held in limbo by the state for a while before they get any benefits. This, of course, is a stretch, but since it is a comedy you just kind of go with it.So after James saves Sandler's life, Sandler agrees to go through with this. This is where the gay jokes ensue. Add in Ving Rhames who is a gay firefighter who comes out of the closet due to James and Sandler and also add in Jessica Biel as some eye candy who Sandler badly wants to date and you have all the ingredients of this comedy. Rob Schneider is funny playing an Asian minister. This movie is pro-gay I would say, so it shouldn't offend homosexuals, and Schneider is part Asian, so I guess he is supposed to be off the hook for making fun of that ethnic group. Anyway, all the jokes are supposed to be in good fun, but some people might get offended. If you are the type of person who gets offended easily, then you probably should avoid this movie.Some nice cameos in the film and the soundtrack is largely comprised of known gay artists.I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend. You would probably be smart to avoid the pricey theater tickets and wait until this comes out on DVD. This is not going to be a classic comedy and is not close to one of Sandler's best. At the same time, I don't think that it is an awful film either. Rating 6 0f 10 stars.

Dugan's 'I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry' starts off like a typical Adam Sandler comedy with the usual lame jokes, but things take off when Kevin James steps in. Parts of the film do remind one of 'Three To Tango' but it has its own jokes and is quite an enjoyable comedic flick. It rests on a thin plot that is lifted by the chemistry between the actors. James and Sandler are supported by a hilarious cast, which includes Ving Rhames (like you've never seen before), Steve Buscemi, Dan Akroyd and Rob Scheider, that provides some excellent comic relief. Jessica Biel has never looked better (what a body!). Child actor Cole Morgen is remarkably talented. And of course Kevin James and Adam Sandler are great. While the film is full of fun and laugh-out-loud moments, fortunately it's not offensive in any way, considering the theme. It's quite pro-gay. Overall, this is a fun film. If one is in search of something light and some laughter, 'I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry' is a recommendation.

Forgive the glowing review above. Cram full of more SNL cast members than an SNL reunion party, C&L makes poor use of most of them. Sandler seemed to provide temporary employment to just about everyone he ever worked with and then gave them all parts worthy of the cutting-room floor."Chuck & Larry" wasn't terrible, as far as "Message Movies" go. But Sandler and James seem to never even TRY to act like a believable gay couple as you'd expect from people trying to "fool" investigators. And their excuse for needing to fake a gay marriage is pretty flimsy (essentially, "I can't find anyone else that'll do it for free.") James plays a widower with two kids at home, a boy and a girl. Since it isn't Germain to the plot, I don't think it's a spoiler to say (stop reading now if you don't want to know ANYTHING ahead of time) that his young son plays an overly-effeminate aspiring Broadway star, and the subject of frequent laughter. But the fact that his butch young daughter, who loves baseball and video games, is never once inferred that she might grow up to be a lesbian. An overlooked double-standard for a movie trying to make a point about "social roles".If you're a guy, the parade of gorgeous babes that Sandler ogles in the first 20 minutes will grab your attention. After that, it's a lot of "awkward situation" jokes (some even funny), and Sandler learning not to be such a jerk.Not fantastic, but I didn't leave the theater demanding my money back either. I assume that if you're interested in this type of movie, you already know what to expect.

I think the critics and the people that say this movie is insensitive are missing the point. One it is a comedy and should be taken for what it's worth. Comedy's are meant to be offensive, making light of obvious observations. If you are offended you should take a look at all the stereotypes and generalizations daytime talk-shows and reality TV shows make; the angry black guy, the overly feminine gay guy, it's ridiculous. Two the point was to show how ignorant people can be when they find out somebody is different than them no-matter race or gender. It is all about acceptance. This movie is a comedy and was hilarious at parts. I thought some parts were overly stupid or overly trying to prove a point, but all in all it was very funny. Contrary to all the haters out there, race and gender jokes are funny in moderation and on a comedic platform. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a classic Adam Sandler flick and has a sense of humor, the man is talented people!

I'm not comparing the two movies, that would be sillier than Chuck and Larry put together. But, we're living the times that we're living and things do matter and things mean more than what they mean and everything means something. So, who's idea was this? Reactionary even in its attempt to be compassionate, tolerant and understanding. The film is not an insult to the issue of gays and gay marriage but to comedy itself. For instance: Chuck and Larry firefighters try to save a massively overweight man from a fire, the man falls on top of them and farts. Yep, that's the standard. Of course the movie opened to grosses large enough to demote Harry Potter himself to second place so they know what they're doing and I'm not sure what planet I'm living in. Richard Chamberlain and Lance Bass make special appearances, oh dear, oh dear. The appeal of Adam Sandler is way beyond me. I kind of liked him in in the PT Anderson movie and in Spanglish he was alright but those films didn't quite perform at the box office so I fear that Chuck and Larry is here to stay. Pity for him and pity for us.

By far the worst comedy of the year. I do not know why anyone would think that Chuck and Larry was funny. Not only was this movie not believable, it was boring. In no way was this movie believable. If you actually think Gay men act this way, then you are living on the moon. I don't know why certain actors even had cameos in this film. This movie wasn't even remotely funny. The plot was dumb, the jokes were bad, and the movie was way too long. Chuck and Larry was not funny at all and was borderline offensive at times. Save yourself 2 hours and watch anything else with Adam Sandler or Kevin James. This movie is not worth the time. You will thank me for it!

Last night I went to a screening of this film and didn't know what to expect. I have to say this is the best Adam Sandler comedy since Happy Gilmore. It seems that with this new comedy duo that Sandler got his magic back. This story is about two firefighters in Brooklyn who have been best friends for what seems like forever. Larry Valentine (James) is a single dad trying to raise two kids on his own and Chuck Levine (Sandler) is a notorious playboy who has a new girl(s) every night. When Larry tries to change his beneficiary from his late wife to his children he finds out that the process would take a long time. Because he's a firefighter, and worries that he could go at anytime, he wants to make sure his kids will be OK. After a traumatic incident he feels even more pressure. When he finds a loophole in the system, he asks Chuck to be his domestic partner. Throughout the movie their relationship is under fire and it's up to their attorney, Alex (Jessica Beal), who believes they're gay, to save them from criminal charges. They try to keep their relationship a secret but it eventually gets out that they're a couple. Everyone they know starts treating them differently and they are witness to the discrimination homosexuals face on a regular basis. Little do they know, when they defend themselves, they defend gay people in general. Dan Aykroyd plays their Captain at the fire house and is also their voice of reason. Steve Buscemi plays an inspector who is sent to their house to catch them at their game. There are numerous cameos, by some of everyone's favorites, and they show up at some of the most random times making their appearance in the movie that much funnier. When I left the theater I felt like a did 100 crunches because I was laughing so hard. It didn't drag, and it didn't get overly sappy, at any point. Some of the jokes are stereotypical, but it's the first time most of them have been on the big screen so it was fresh humor. I sat next to my gay friend through the screening and I've never seen a man laugh so hard in my entire life. So, for all you people who think this movie will be a bash at homosexuals, I say watch the movie and then make your opinions. I enjoyed this movie so much that, when it comes out in July, I will PAY to go see it with my friends.

Adam Sandler and Kevin James play two unlikely heterosexual firefighters who hatch a plan to get married, mainly so that widower James can have Sandler be his beneficiary for his children in case he dies on the job. They run into a heap of trouble when they are investigated and can face jail time by perpetrating a fraud. Now they're going to have to pretend to be gay partners. I had to see this for myself... first because I love Kevin James' television series THE KING OF QUEENS, second because sometimes Adam Sandler's comedy hits me right, and also because I was curious from hearing all the vocal objections to the gay stereotypes in this movie. Turns out that this was a moderately humorous comedy to me and, just as I suspected all along, it's done in good fun as it jabs at the gay lifestyle, yet also manages to show the level of intolerance and prejudices that homosexuals face on a regular basis. This was nothing like the horrendous and "mean spirited" comedy I'd heard so much about. Of course, it's not exactly "PC" for these times, but the stereotypical gags here are no worse than WHITE CHICKS (stereotyping blonde girls), SHALLOW HAL (ripping on fat women), THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (needling middle aged "geeks"), or any other such types of movies. Hey, everyone gets their turn in the barrel. **1/2 out of ****

It was hard for me to get past the premise that Larry had to be married in order to have his pension go to his children if he died. That made no sense at all and was not believable. And why would he even want Sandler's character to raise his children, given his wild bachelor lifestyle? But, I reminded myself that it was a comedy and I let the movie's ridiculous premise go. Still, there wasn't much to laugh at in the movie. I'm heterosexual but felt it made fun of gay people and played up stereotypes. Why was just about everyone at an AIDS fund raiser flamboyantly gay? Why did the wedding chapel guy have to have stereotyped Asian speech and appearance reminiscent of racist films from the 1930s? (I know Rob Schneider is part Filipino, but it was still bad). And why did the women have to be such bimbos? I know, it was a comedy, but it was so offensive that I found very little humor in it.

Adam Sandler and Kevin James are great in this hysterical and in the end uplifting comedy. You might be mis judging this comedy like most mis judged The Ringer as an excuse to crudely make fun of a specific group but like The Ringer it actually demonstrates a very positive message that people can learn from. Adam Sandler fans will love this movie because it's one of his better films in which he gives a funny performance without being too over the top like he was in Waterboy or Little Nicky. Kevin James is great as usual giving us a lovable good hearted character in which everything blows up in his face. These two make a great team for comedy as good and as lovable as Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels or David Spade and Chris Farley truly two funny guys you love to see play off of each others performances. In terms of the humour style much like Click it fits everyone's style of humour as it contains random, slapstick, witty, uplifting, insulting, over the top, character, and crude humour. I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry will have pretty much everyone laughing and in the end won't be offending or angering anyone. Those who thought Jessica Biel would add or detract from the quality of the film don't worry as she doesn't do either she just gives a pretty steady performance without overshadowing anyone else or being overshadowed by everyone else. I think Adam Sandler is on a role due to his later films being much more uplifting and funny rather than just over the top funny. If Adam Sandler keeps up with Reign Over Me, Click, and now Chuck and Larry he will remain as lovable and memorable as legends like Rodney Dangerfield and Leslie Nielson. Kevin James to put it simply is a sitcom actor meaning he has amazing comedic timing and can always keep you laughing with lines that if said by anyone else would'nt be funny a very bright future for him and a great step forward with Chuck and Larry. My only complaints are within the fact that it gets a little sappy, and the storyline gets too out of this world and unbelievable at certain points. Overall it's a great movie and a real accomplishment for both Adam Sandler and Kevin James.

I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry written by Academy Award winning writers Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor along with Barry Fanaro, is one of the smartest, and tender comedies of the year. The film stars comedy superstars Adam Sandler and Kevin James as two NYC firefighters, Chuck Levine and Larry Valentine who pretend to be a gay couple in order to get domestic partnership benefits for Larry's children who has recently lost their mother. When the partnership is questioned by City Official Clinton Fitzer played by another comedic icon, Steve Buscemi, they turn to the beautiful intelligent lawyer, Alex played by the sexy Jessica Biel.The film brings forth some laughs but all in all the film soars on dramatic level which I believe Payne and Taylor weren't exactly aiming for. Sandler still struggles as a dramatic actor and finds it hard to find his inner characters without bringing himself out. We are still waiting for him to return to form as he did in Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love. James however, is quite an actor who shows the most vulnerable parts of Larry without going over the top. We enjoy Larry's company and look forward to his story unraveling. Kevin James will have an easier transition into more affluent and demanding roles as an actor than Sandler has.You also have your usual suspects in the Sandler films like the unrecognizable Rob Schnieder and you'll find some comfort in Dan Aykroyd who has been missed from the screen for some time and Ving Rhames who is always as funny as he is intimidating. But don't look for a revolutionary story to befall in front of you, it's a good watch, not a great one.The film drags on a bit and no stand outs that scream recognition. It's a new addition to good popcorn flicks of 2007.Grade: **½/****

WARNING: I don't know how this film eventually received the PG-13 rating, as there is quite a bit of sexual humor, adult language and male nudity. While for an adult audience this is okay, don't mistakenly think this is a kids movie.I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY is a decent time-passer but not a whole lot more. I think most of the problem is that the film makers could have either played the film straight (so to speak) and tried to make it profound or they could have simply played it for laughs. BUT, trying to do both at the same time (like this movie did) tended to lessen the social commentary as well as take away from what could have been a much funnier film. In other words, playing this middle ground, in hindsight, probably wasn't the best idea. As a result, when the film tried to be serious and make gay-positive assertions, it came off as forced and half-hearted.Considering that the film came out two years ago by the time I wrote this review and by now there are a bazillion reviews already, I won't summarize the film's plot. Instead, let's focus on what I liked. Sandler and James were both very good in the leads--I have no complaints there other than they tried way too hard to make Sandler some sort of stud. If he were NOT a movie star, there is no way he'd be able to get the girls he got in the film (especially pretty and very young Jessica Biel). Some of the supporting actors were very good. I liked Ving Rhames, Dan Aykroyd, the amazing dancing kid and that crazy dancing hobo. However, a few of the supporting actors sucked. Steve Buscemi's character was a caricature with no depth whatsoever as were all the non-gay positive characters--they were one-dimensional and were more like stereotypes than people. Also, how in the heck did Rob Schneider get away with such an awful and offensive performance?! Having him play a Japanese man (badly) hearkens to the days of Sidney Toler and Warner Oland (both Westerners) playing 'Charlie Chan'. I thought those days of having non-Asians play Asians (very broadly) were over--one of the positive aspects of political correctness. Now it is a little-known fact that Schneider's mother is a Filipino, but he still doesn't look the least bit Japanese and his character was MORE over the top than Peter Lorre's 'Mr. Moto'--and was a lot like Brando's impersonation of a Japanese man in TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON or Mickey Rooney's in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S (ugghh!!). With Schneider's Moe Howard-like wig, thick classes and buck teeth, he simply is a walking stereotype.Overall, it's a decent time-passer you can watch if you have Showtime. Otherwise, it's very easy to just skip this one.

For funny movies this year I still hold "Knocked Up" as the winner, but this movie is also very good. I found many of the gay parts very funny. It is a very predictable movie, but still your surprised by some of the words and actions that come from each character. I would say, as a fan of Kevin James, his performance is not as good as when he is on King of Queens, partly because Sandler gets so much screen time. Supporting characters like Ving Rhames and Dan Akroyd add a lot to the story. Jessica Biel is very hot in this movie( NO more 7th heaven). I will say she is hotter than Katherine Heigl in Knocked Up, so if your into hotties, you'll like. But all in all, I suggest you see this movie if your looking for some good laughs.

I'm really sorry that I paid for this movie and lost my time... the 4 stars I give to the movie are for the message, which, after all, can't be denied to be cute... love is all in the end! I haven't really seen that many movies with Adam Sandler in them, but the ones I've seen, I've liked them, so I thought, hey, Adam's in a gay movie, great!...I guess to the eyes of most straights who are not that involved in the gay thing, the jokes in the movie were awesome.. yeah... it's all stereotypes and we make fun of the stereotypes everywhere... but that is the thing... while stereotypes are made fun of, they don't really educate, clarify, or any similar, and that, to the gay community is something very crucial at this point of the history... At this point, the gay community NEEDS that the mainstream knows what homosexuality REALLY is..The movie presents gays as all being sissies, effeminate, girly, etc... come to think of it... even the grumpy fireman who turned out to be gay (being the reason to all his anger, as he was afraid of coming out) ended up being a sissie..Now, don't take me wrong... sissies have nothing wrong... they're actually fabulous, and they are PART of the DIVERSITY of the gay community... but they are not the total... there are a HUGE more types of people, just like in the "straight community" and it's not fair that we gays are always thought of as girly guys who squeal when they see a mouse, once again, not because there's something wrong with that, but because it's just not the way everyone is... after all, everyone is entitled to individuality.Some of you have seen it, for example, in the "Brokeback Mountain" film. Those two cowboys, being bisexual both of them, were not at all sissies, but there wasn't much problem with that movie in the sense that it dealed with only two... however this time in the Adam Sandler movie ALL LGBT people is presented as being gay...catch my grip?

OK it is full of stereotypes, yes the movie does old jokes, it is fairly predictable and we have seen it before. The crucial question is this  is it funny? The simple answer is yes. My wife wasn't enthused about this one, but she laughed heartily. For a comedy to be any good you need to laugh out loud at least 6 times. I think I laughed about 10-12 times. Some of the scenes were set up really well and the comedy acting was superb.OK the plot is unbelievable and a little silly, but it's a comedy! Give it a go. If you love meet the parents, dumb and dumber, there is something about Mary and Kingpin, you will enjoy the show. If you have a cinematic bypass and love politically correct left-wing tripe  then this one isn't for you. Its as simple as that!

The story is as simple as it is promised. But I can't see anything negative about that. The protagonists don't show an outstanding performance but when I watched the movie I got the impression that their shown emotions are true and that is all that counts in an movie like this. OK, the gags are not very innovative but I had to laugh a dozen times. This movie didn't betray me. I got what I have expected. I like Adam Sandler movies because of their simplicity. There have to be films that are easy to watch without being very attentive. So this movies can be watched to relax and to laugh. I think that it is a little bit underrated here. And so it is a 7 out of 10. Not more but also not less.

This might just have been the worst film I've ever seen. It is not a comedy, not at all, because the jokes in it is just NOT funny, they are so cheap and easy that you would believe that someone wrote the script in one hour and fifty minutes! The fact that this film's got 6.2 on IMDb is simply quite disturbing and makes me wonder how stupid people these days are! I felt it as my responsibility to warn other potential watchers of this film, PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT! And what the heck is up with Adam Sandler! He have to be the worst actor ever, and he seems to appear in all the wrong movies! And don't listen do them who thinks this is an excellent movie, they are either idiots or they have been doing something else than watching the film...

LOL Rob Schneider playing a stereotypical asian, everyone using the f-word for gay -- this is one offensive movie -- but damn, if it isn't refreshing seeing something as obscene as this these days.Everything is so stuck up and cringey and bad but taking itself seriously these days... that a movie like this, that's nothing too special but an average early 2000s comedy felt fresh AF.It's pretty funny, has some good friendship moments, wholesome moments, offensive moments... I don't know, I kinda liked it. Like I said, it's a breath of fresh air now, eventhough in its day it was probably nothing too shocking.I sympathize with gay dudes, because I can imagine how difficult it must be to admit you are one in a world where men are expected to adhere to standards that society pretends aren't there anymore but they are. So this movie also raises some good questions for the viewers. It's actually anything but dumb and offensive, it's pretty thought provoking.

This is a film where Adam Sandler literally tries too hard to act manly and cool. This is a very stereotypical movie with a lot of gay jokes thrown in, and has some sexist images of women. Charles "Chuck" Levine (Sandler) and Lawrence "Larry" Valentine (James) are veteran FDNY fire fighters. And during there routine Chuck almost gets killed and Larry saves his life. Soon Larry realizes he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance due to the death of his wife. So in order to get his benefit he needs to get married. Larry asks Chuck to enter a pretend marriage with him after Larry read a article about domestic partnerships. Chuck declines at first, but is reminded of his debt to Larry so he agrees. The main highlight of this film is when Alex McDonough(Jessica Biel) is thrown into the mix, who play Chuck and Larry's lawyer. I however disliked Adam Sandler in this movie, he just tries way too hard to prove he isn't gay in this film to point it gets a bit annoying and he is like banging every girl that crosses his path in this one, yeah firemen get girls but c'mon. At times it had it's moments and had some funny jokes but it really drags and don't know how to quit. I think it would have been awesome if Chuck and Larry eventually found out they are gay for each other cause Chuck is a sleazy gay character, but I doubt Adam Sandler would do it since he has such a high image of himself which I realized after I finished watching this movie. Basically the film is about Adam Sandler trying really hard to look manly, while there is a bunch of stereotypical gay jokes thrown in. Jessica Biel was really hot and attractive in this and is the main highlight of this film and finds herself in many situations in her underwear. Which is the main point, but her assets is a nice touch, so I can't complain.5.5/10

In "I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry," Adam Sandler and Kevin James play two New York City fire fighters who pretend to be gay so that Larry's two kids can be raised by Chuck in the event of Larry's untimely death (Larry's wife has been dead for two years and he has not been able to bring himself to date another woman in all that time). The hitch is that to bring this about, the two of them will have to officially register as "domestic partners." Originally, they intend on keeping their "relationship" a secret, but when the government starts sending inspectors around to verify the validity of their claim, Chuck and Larry are left with the choice of admitting to the scam and going to jail or convincing everyone around them that they are indeed an actual couple.As a "high concept" comedy, "I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry" is pretty much a contrived manufacture from the get-go, mixing equal parts humor and sentiment in an attempt to play to the broadest possible audience - which is probably the only way the filmmakers could reasonably have gone with material this dicey. Yet, while the movie traffics in any number of lame stereotypes (gay as well as ethnic), it also has some important things to say about equality and acceptance in an ever changing world. The script achieves about a 50/50 ration in its humor - about half the jokes are zingers while the other half are clunkers - but the movie's heart is definitely in the right place, so much so that you will forgive the filmmakers when the story turns all heavy-handed and preachy towards the end, in what is surely one of the least plausible courtroom scenes in motion picture history. As compensation, the movie actually places its characters in some pretty sticky moral dilemmas at times, the prime one being that, much as we may like and admire Chuck and Larry for all the social barriers they are tearing down, we still hear that little nagging voice in the back of our heads telling us that they are defrauding the public and breaking the law while doing so. Such moral ambiguity is actually a pretty rare commodity for a mainstream American comedy these days.Sandler and James imbue their roles with a great deal of charm and gusto, and they receive strong support from Dan Aykroyd, Jessica Biel, Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi."I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry" certainly isn't up to the level of "Knocked Up" or "Superbad," its summer 2007 comedy contemporaries, but neither is it the cinematic disaster most of the critics have accused it of being. It's an uneven but largely likable romp that makes you feel good about the world when it's over.

I have a gay friend who doesn't fit the stereotype in that he loves the WWE and usually watches crude comedies like this latest Adam Sandler comedy. Many critics have called this movie offensive because of many homophobic jokes that abound as well as the Asian stereotype that Sandler's friend Rob Schneider plays as a Canadian wedding preacher. Well, since I'm Asian-American and I know Schneider is half so, I admit I wasn't very amused by his portrayal but I also decided maybe Rob thought so and decided, "What the hell!" and went for it. But many of the homophobic jokes do work and is partly redeemed by some gay humor that seemed more silly than offensive and some were even hilarious. Besides Schneider, other former SNLers to appear include David Spade, Rachel Dratch, and original cast member Dan Aykroyd. All have some moments. Also appearing are Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames in a performance you won't believe (or maybe you will depending what you think he's capable of), and a couple of celebrities that recently came out, Lance Bass and Richard Chamberlain. And Keven James isn't bad either! Overall, based on bad reviews, I dreaded this movie but I laughed enough and enjoyed enough to at least recommend this to anyone who can laugh at almost anything. P.S. My gay friend absolutely loved this!

Forgive the glowing review above. Cram full of more SNL cast members than an SNL reunion party, C&L makes poor use of most of them. Sandler seemed to provide temporary employment to just about everyone he ever worked with and then gave them all parts worthy of the cutting-room floor."Chuck & Larry" wasn't terrible, as far as "Message Movies" go. But Sandler and James seem to never even TRY to act like a believable gay couple as you'd expect from people trying to "fool" investigators. And their excuse for needing to fake a gay marriage is pretty flimsy (essentially, "I can't find anyone else that'll do it for free.") James plays a widower with two kids at home, a boy and a girl. Since it isn't Germain to the plot, I don't think it's a spoiler to say (stop reading now if you don't want to know ANYTHING ahead of time) that his young son plays an overly-effeminate aspiring Broadway star, and the subject of frequent laughter. But the fact that his butch young daughter, who loves baseball and video games, is never once inferred that she might grow up to be a lesbian. An overlooked double-standard for a movie trying to make a point about "social roles".If you're a guy, the parade of gorgeous babes that Sandler ogles in the first 20 minutes will grab your attention. After that, it's a lot of "awkward situation" jokes (some even funny), and Sandler learning not to be such a jerk.Not fantastic, but I didn't leave the theater demanding my money back either. I assume that if you're interested in this type of movie, you already know what to expect.

I think the critics and the people that say this movie is insensitive are missing the point. One it is a comedy and should be taken for what it's worth. Comedy's are meant to be offensive, making light of obvious observations. If you are offended you should take a look at all the stereotypes and generalizations daytime talk-shows and reality TV shows make; the angry black guy, the overly feminine gay guy, it's ridiculous. Two the point was to show how ignorant people can be when they find out somebody is different than them no-matter race or gender. It is all about acceptance. This movie is a comedy and was hilarious at parts. I thought some parts were overly stupid or overly trying to prove a point, but all in all it was very funny. Contrary to all the haters out there, race and gender jokes are funny in moderation and on a comedic platform. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a classic Adam Sandler flick and has a sense of humor, the man is talented people!

I'm not comparing the two movies, that would be sillier than Chuck and Larry put together. But, we're living the times that we're living and things do matter and things mean more than what they mean and everything means something. So, who's idea was this? Reactionary even in its attempt to be compassionate, tolerant and understanding. The film is not an insult to the issue of gays and gay marriage but to comedy itself. For instance: Chuck and Larry firefighters try to save a massively overweight man from a fire, the man falls on top of them and farts. Yep, that's the standard. Of course the movie opened to grosses large enough to demote Harry Potter himself to second place so they know what they're doing and I'm not sure what planet I'm living in. Richard Chamberlain and Lance Bass make special appearances, oh dear, oh dear. The appeal of Adam Sandler is way beyond me. I kind of liked him in in the PT Anderson movie and in Spanglish he was alright but those films didn't quite perform at the box office so I fear that Chuck and Larry is here to stay. Pity for him and pity for us.

Adam Sandler and Kevin James play two unlikely heterosexual firefighters who hatch a plan to get married, mainly so that widower James can have Sandler be his beneficiary for his children in case he dies on the job. They run into a heap of trouble when they are investigated and can face jail time by perpetrating a fraud. Now they're going to have to pretend to be gay partners. I had to see this for myself... first because I love Kevin James' television series THE KING OF QUEENS, second because sometimes Adam Sandler's comedy hits me right, and also because I was curious from hearing all the vocal objections to the gay stereotypes in this movie. Turns out that this was a moderately humorous comedy to me and, just as I suspected all along, it's done in good fun as it jabs at the gay lifestyle, yet also manages to show the level of intolerance and prejudices that homosexuals face on a regular basis. This was nothing like the horrendous and "mean spirited" comedy I'd heard so much about. Of course, it's not exactly "PC" for these times, but the stereotypical gags here are no worse than WHITE CHICKS (stereotyping blonde girls), SHALLOW HAL (ripping on fat women), THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (needling middle aged "geeks"), or any other such types of movies. Hey, everyone gets their turn in the barrel. **1/2 out of ****

By far the worst comedy of the year. I do not know why anyone would think that Chuck and Larry was funny. Not only was this movie not believable, it was boring. In no way was this movie believable. If you actually think Gay men act this way, then you are living on the moon. I don't know why certain actors even had cameos in this film. This movie wasn't even remotely funny. The plot was dumb, the jokes were bad, and the movie was way too long. Chuck and Larry was not funny at all and was borderline offensive at times. Save yourself 2 hours and watch anything else with Adam Sandler or Kevin James. This movie is not worth the time. You will thank me for it!

Last night I went to a screening of this film and didn't know what to expect. I have to say this is the best Adam Sandler comedy since Happy Gilmore. It seems that with this new comedy duo that Sandler got his magic back. This story is about two firefighters in Brooklyn who have been best friends for what seems like forever. Larry Valentine (James) is a single dad trying to raise two kids on his own and Chuck Levine (Sandler) is a notorious playboy who has a new girl(s) every night. When Larry tries to change his beneficiary from his late wife to his children he finds out that the process would take a long time. Because he's a firefighter, and worries that he could go at anytime, he wants to make sure his kids will be OK. After a traumatic incident he feels even more pressure. When he finds a loophole in the system, he asks Chuck to be his domestic partner. Throughout the movie their relationship is under fire and it's up to their attorney, Alex (Jessica Beal), who believes they're gay, to save them from criminal charges. They try to keep their relationship a secret but it eventually gets out that they're a couple. Everyone they know starts treating them differently and they are witness to the discrimination homosexuals face on a regular basis. Little do they know, when they defend themselves, they defend gay people in general. Dan Aykroyd plays their Captain at the fire house and is also their voice of reason. Steve Buscemi plays an inspector who is sent to their house to catch them at their game. There are numerous cameos, by some of everyone's favorites, and they show up at some of the most random times making their appearance in the movie that much funnier. When I left the theater I felt like a did 100 crunches because I was laughing so hard. It didn't drag, and it didn't get overly sappy, at any point. Some of the jokes are stereotypical, but it's the first time most of them have been on the big screen so it was fresh humor. I sat next to my gay friend through the screening and I've never seen a man laugh so hard in my entire life. So, for all you people who think this movie will be a bash at homosexuals, I say watch the movie and then make your opinions. I enjoyed this movie so much that, when it comes out in July, I will PAY to go see it with my friends.

With the potential for comedy that gay firemen and the physical contrast that Kevin James and Adam Sandler present, Chuck and Larry is very subdued. There is a noticeable absence of scenes that any classic comedy could include, the prolonging of an awkward situation or capturing a situation's spiral into chaos and absurdity, and the often exaggerated representation of a gay man by a straight man, a caricature such as Sacha Baron Cohen's Bruno, in comedic settings are all conspicuously few in Chuck and Larry. In this sense, it fails the true aim of a comedy, and the foundations, the themes on which the script and plot are constructed, lend no momentum to the comic force of the movie. That is not to say this film lacks humour entirely, just that it is not as upfront as one would expect. It has its gems, though they are at times far in between, and though the film disappoints its potential, you will find yourself laughing. Laughing, however, is not the only reaction you will have to this movie. Chuck and Larry manages to present the issue of gender equality and sensitivity in the familiar and comfortable vehicle of a buddy comedy. In showing straight men tackling the challenges homophobia, it makes obvious the ignorance that causes and motivates discrimination. For a comedy to successfully deliver such a clear message without feeling burdened by that responsibility is "Chuck and Larry"'s saving grace, and indeed redeems it as a film.

It was hard for me to get past the premise that Larry had to be married in order to have his pension go to his children if he died. That made no sense at all and was not believable. And why would he even want Sandler's character to raise his children, given his wild bachelor lifestyle? But, I reminded myself that it was a comedy and I let the movie's ridiculous premise go. Still, there wasn't much to laugh at in the movie. I'm heterosexual but felt it made fun of gay people and played up stereotypes. Why was just about everyone at an AIDS fund raiser flamboyantly gay? Why did the wedding chapel guy have to have stereotyped Asian speech and appearance reminiscent of racist films from the 1930s? (I know Rob Schneider is part Filipino, but it was still bad). And why did the women have to be such bimbos? I know, it was a comedy, but it was so offensive that I found very little humor in it.

Chuck and Larry are buddies and fellow fire-fighters in New York. They are very close and would do anything for one another so, when a problem with Larry's pension arrangements comes up that can be solved by entering into a civil partnership, Chuck agrees to pose as his "husband" in order to solve the admin problem. Sadly a high profile fraud case in another state means that the "couple" are under scrutiny from obsessive investigator Clint Fritzer and must play their roles to the full. Hilarity naturally ensues but can everyone also learn a lesson as well?It dismays me to hear people praising this film for its "sensitive handling" of the subject of homosexuality and the way it challenges bigoted thinking on the subject – such thoughts can be found in the comments section on this site and they dismay me because sadly to some viewers this film may be the nearest thing to "discussion" on homosexuality that they have had. In this way maybe one could make a case for this film being an effective but blunt tool for the mostly teenage male fan-base of Adam Sandler to be "reached" and "educated" by giving them what they want in terms of crude humour and broad stereotypes but then also leaving them with a message that will teach them the error of their ways. It would certainly be nice to say that but one cannot help feel that this is not the reality and that, rather than using the crude stereotypes as a vehicle to deliver a message to a traditionally homophobic fan-base, the film is actually using the message to facilitate lots of homosexual stereotypes, jokes and clichés.This is what the film does throughout – it wants to have its cake and then also get to eat it. So, spoiler alert, it turns out that homosexuals are people too. Apparently (according to the film) it is NOT OK to treat them differently and exclude them from things and anyone who does, well, y'know what, ell, turns out those that are do are the real jerks. That is about as sophisticated as the message gets but that is perhaps to be expected and for the target audience maybe that is challenging enough. Unfortunately for the wider audience or casual viewer it will come off as little more than patronising and not make up for the fact that the majority of the film flies in the face of this. What the rest of the film does is draw laughs from the fact that two straight characters have to "be gay" – which of course means all the stereotypical stuff that we all know. So nobody wants to pick up the soap in the shower (because all a gay man needs to be aroused is the sight of someone's ass), disco music is played, finger-snapping is everywhere and so on. Fortunately it is sporadically amusing and provided me with a few chuckles whether I wanted to give them up or not. It is not THAT funny though and the casual viewer will mostly just let the brash, obvious humour wash over them without it doing much.The cast buy into it well though and do their best to sell it. Sandler is his usual rather annoying self and does his best to prove he cannot act by being the usual "irresistible to women" thing rather than the "creepy man-child" that he would be were his character real. James comes off a lot better I'm not really seen him before although he probably does fit TV better than films but he does have a good comic presence and also does OK with coming over more of a regular guy. Loved Ving Rhames in it – sending up his tough guy image while Buscemi, Aykroyd and a few others are amusing in support. Biel has an amazing body and that is pretty much what she is asked to do – be in underwear and look stunning, both of which she effortlessly does but nothing else comes forward.This film is not the awful piece of comedy that some critics have said but it is a simple, stereotypical comedy about homosexual clichés that tries to justify it by having a very basic message that most people should have already learnt in the 1990's. While some may praise the film for having this message I find it more concerning that people still see this message as somehow "worthy" rather than "d'uh – of course". Some laughs help it through and Sandler's fans will enjoy it despite the "message" but for the casual viewer it is just another clumsy and crude Adam Sandler film.

Adam Sandler and Kevin James are great in this hysterical and in the end uplifting comedy. You might be mis judging this comedy like most mis judged The Ringer as an excuse to crudely make fun of a specific group but like The Ringer it actually demonstrates a very positive message that people can learn from. Adam Sandler fans will love this movie because it's one of his better films in which he gives a funny performance without being too over the top like he was in Waterboy or Little Nicky. Kevin James is great as usual giving us a lovable good hearted character in which everything blows up in his face. These two make a great team for comedy as good and as lovable as Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels or David Spade and Chris Farley truly two funny guys you love to see play off of each others performances. In terms of the humour style much like Click it fits everyone's style of humour as it contains random, slapstick, witty, uplifting, insulting, over the top, character, and crude humour. I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry will have pretty much everyone laughing and in the end won't be offending or angering anyone. Those who thought Jessica Biel would add or detract from the quality of the film don't worry as she doesn't do either she just gives a pretty steady performance without overshadowing anyone else or being overshadowed by everyone else. I think Adam Sandler is on a role due to his later films being much more uplifting and funny rather than just over the top funny. If Adam Sandler keeps up with Reign Over Me, Click, and now Chuck and Larry he will remain as lovable and memorable as legends like Rodney Dangerfield and Leslie Nielson. Kevin James to put it simply is a sitcom actor meaning he has amazing comedic timing and can always keep you laughing with lines that if said by anyone else would'nt be funny a very bright future for him and a great step forward with Chuck and Larry. My only complaints are within the fact that it gets a little sappy, and the storyline gets too out of this world and unbelievable at certain points. Overall it's a great movie and a real accomplishment for both Adam Sandler and Kevin James.

I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry written by Academy Award winning writers Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor along with Barry Fanaro, is one of the smartest, and tender comedies of the year. The film stars comedy superstars Adam Sandler and Kevin James as two NYC firefighters, Chuck Levine and Larry Valentine who pretend to be a gay couple in order to get domestic partnership benefits for Larry's children who has recently lost their mother. When the partnership is questioned by City Official Clinton Fitzer played by another comedic icon, Steve Buscemi, they turn to the beautiful intelligent lawyer, Alex played by the sexy Jessica Biel.The film brings forth some laughs but all in all the film soars on dramatic level which I believe Payne and Taylor weren't exactly aiming for. Sandler still struggles as a dramatic actor and finds it hard to find his inner characters without bringing himself out. We are still waiting for him to return to form as he did in Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love. James however, is quite an actor who shows the most vulnerable parts of Larry without going over the top. We enjoy Larry's company and look forward to his story unraveling. Kevin James will have an easier transition into more affluent and demanding roles as an actor than Sandler has.You also have your usual suspects in the Sandler films like the unrecognizable Rob Schnieder and you'll find some comfort in Dan Aykroyd who has been missed from the screen for some time and Ving Rhames who is always as funny as he is intimidating. But don't look for a revolutionary story to befall in front of you, it's a good watch, not a great one.The film drags on a bit and no stand outs that scream recognition. It's a new addition to good popcorn flicks of 2007.Grade: **½/****

WARNING: I don't know how this film eventually received the PG-13 rating, as there is quite a bit of sexual humor, adult language and male nudity. While for an adult audience this is okay, don't mistakenly think this is a kids movie.I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY is a decent time-passer but not a whole lot more. I think most of the problem is that the film makers could have either played the film straight (so to speak) and tried to make it profound or they could have simply played it for laughs. BUT, trying to do both at the same time (like this movie did) tended to lessen the social commentary as well as take away from what could have been a much funnier film. In other words, playing this middle ground, in hindsight, probably wasn't the best idea. As a result, when the film tried to be serious and make gay-positive assertions, it came off as forced and half-hearted.Considering that the film came out two years ago by the time I wrote this review and by now there are a bazillion reviews already, I won't summarize the film's plot. Instead, let's focus on what I liked. Sandler and James were both very good in the leads--I have no complaints there other than they tried way too hard to make Sandler some sort of stud. If he were NOT a movie star, there is no way he'd be able to get the girls he got in the film (especially pretty and very young Jessica Biel). Some of the supporting actors were very good. I liked Ving Rhames, Dan Aykroyd, the amazing dancing kid and that crazy dancing hobo. However, a few of the supporting actors sucked. Steve Buscemi's character was a caricature with no depth whatsoever as were all the non-gay positive characters--they were one-dimensional and were more like stereotypes than people. Also, how in the heck did Rob Schneider get away with such an awful and offensive performance?! Having him play a Japanese man (badly) hearkens to the days of Sidney Toler and Warner Oland (both Westerners) playing 'Charlie Chan'. I thought those days of having non-Asians play Asians (very broadly) were over--one of the positive aspects of political correctness. Now it is a little-known fact that Schneider's mother is a Filipino, but he still doesn't look the least bit Japanese and his character was MORE over the top than Peter Lorre's 'Mr. Moto'--and was a lot like Brando's impersonation of a Japanese man in TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON or Mickey Rooney's in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S (ugghh!!). With Schneider's Moe Howard-like wig, thick classes and buck teeth, he simply is a walking stereotype.Overall, it's a decent time-passer you can watch if you have Showtime. Otherwise, it's very easy to just skip this one.

For funny movies this year I still hold "Knocked Up" as the winner, but this movie is also very good. I found many of the gay parts very funny. It is a very predictable movie, but still your surprised by some of the words and actions that come from each character. I would say, as a fan of Kevin James, his performance is not as good as when he is on King of Queens, partly because Sandler gets so much screen time. Supporting characters like Ving Rhames and Dan Akroyd add a lot to the story. Jessica Biel is very hot in this movie( NO more 7th heaven). I will say she is hotter than Katherine Heigl in Knocked Up, so if your into hotties, you'll like. But all in all, I suggest you see this movie if your looking for some good laughs.

Is it possible to claim to support marriage rights for same-sex couples and still be homophobic? After seeing "I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry" the answer is yes. Two heterosexual Brooklyn firemen (Kevin James and Adam Sandler) file a domestic partnership claim so that one of the men can protect his children in case of his death, him being a widower. In spite of the specious setup, the opportunities for a charming farce were all there, but Sandler (and director Dennis "as an actor I was who they got when they couldn't get Bruce Dern so I now direct bad comedies instead" Dugan) mucked it up with a bunch of lame jokes and condescending stereotypes of gays.The woman (Jessica Biel) who advises Chuck and Larry to beware of a fraud investigation is a heterosexual woman with a flaming queen for a brother. Everyone at the AIDS benefit is a voguing, prancing flamer dressed in costumes that would make Elton John squirm, and when anti-gay protesters crowd the outside of the building where the event is held, only Adam Sandler and Jessica Biel's characters have the courage to stand up to them at all. In another scene, the mailman hits on one of them. What's worse is Kevin James' character's effeminate son. Apparently because he wants to try out for the school musical and can dance, he must be gay.This is not an issue of political correctness, which I abhor. In fact, I don't mind gay jokes that are funny. But there's a line between jokes about homosexuality and making fun of gays, which this movie crosses like it was the finish line of the 100 yard dash. This film's message is apparently that "gays are sick freaks, but let them get married anyway." That is a profoundly anti-gay message. SInce GLAAD approved this film just as they also approved the patronizing BS of "Will and Grace" and "Queer as Folk", they ought to change their name to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Intellectual Honesty. Adding insult to that injury, the film's funny moments are too few and far between.What's perplexing is how Barry Fanaro, a former writer for "The Golden Girls," a classic 1980s sitcom which had a few episodes about non-stereotyped gays, got into this mess. I guess Lifetime Network's been stiffing him on residuals and he's sick of Ramen Noodles. There is also an embarrassingly bad performance by Rob Schneider as an Asian justice of the peace. In fact, I'm more offended by this than Mickey Rooney's character in "Breakfast at Tiffany's;" at least that film could use the excuse that it was 1961, but there's no excuse here. That the untalented Schneider is half-Filipino does not make it better. And how did Dan Aykroyd or the obnoxious David Spade get involved in this bigoted debacle? With all the SNL alumni in this vomit-inducing garbage, I guess I'll be watching MAD TV from now on.

"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry" is not likely to make anybody's list of top ten movies, but neither is it a candidate for the worst movie of the year, as Peter Sobczynski claims in his review. No movie featuring Jessica Biel in an extended scene wearing only a skimpy lingerie ensemble can be entirely bad. The premise is sound, a fish out of water story about two homophobic guys who pretend to be gay and learn to understand and respect gays. The premise is similar to "Tootsie," although the execution is not as strong. Sandler is poorly self-cast as a Lothario who learns to love, while James plays a heartbroken single father who is unable to move on after the death of his wife. The structure is also reasonably strong. The McGuffin is a bit weak, but once the story begins, the two learn that being gay is not simply enacting a lot of stereotypical clichés, but also involves contending with a lot of prejudices and discrimination. They also learn that many of their acquaintances are homosexuals who do not fit their preconceived stereotypes. And they progress from being embarrassed by their charade to becoming vocal and active proponents of gay rights. The film offers solid performances in unexpected roles by Jessica Biel, Dan Aykroyd, Ving Rhames, Richard Chamberlain and others. Production values are more than adequate. The major flaw is in the writing, which limits the caliber of some of the performances. On one hand, the writing is hackneyed, derivative, obvious and in your face with scenes and situations that lack originality. On the other hand, it lacks focus, with scenes that don't propel the story, such as the justice of the peace played as a caricature of Japanese stereotypes. Sometimes this works, as with a character who has unexpected talents as a dancer, but at other times it seems to detract from the noble ambitions of the film with crude humor. One expects a homophobic character to make insulting remarks and jokes about gays, but that doesn't automatically carry license to also mock other groups. The characters have a series of encounters with homophobic associates, gays, closet homosexuals, gay rights activists and supportive individuals that serve as impetus for their maturation and acceptance of gays, but the encounters are presented so clumsily that they seem ineffective on either dramatic or a comedic grounds. The scenes and characters are also drawn very conservatively. Nobody is so homophobic as to seem vile, contemptible or despicable, so none of the characters has much room for growth and the attitude reversals that are seen don't seem entirely justified, based on the experiences seen by the audience. Sandler's character is particularly problematic. Sandler is a capable comedic actor who seems best suited to unjustly maligned Everyman roles. Most would probably consider him of better than average looks and physique; however, he's not likely to make anybody's list of hottest male actors. He plays a character with superhuman sexual prowess and effortless appeal to women, which comes off as more of a caricature of a womanizing playboy who belongs in a different film. Since his character is not believable, his emotional growth also seems unbelievable. There are bits that are humorous as isolated gags, although some are raunchy and politically incorrect, but they are integrated into a cohesive whole and distract from the central theme and throughline. The film's treatment of gays is a bit uneven. While a few characters are treated sympathetically as complex individuals, many are treated as stereotypes, particularly at a fundraiser party. The general message conveyed and learned is that gays are not as bad as you thought, but never suggests that gays are a positive force in society or that they make society stronger or that heterosexuals can learn something from them. Nothing balances out the jokes, jibes and caricatures. Parts of the film are subpar, but performances by Biel, Rhames and Aykroyd elevate it considerably.

I'm really sorry that I paid for this movie and lost my time... the 4 stars I give to the movie are for the message, which, after all, can't be denied to be cute... love is all in the end! I haven't really seen that many movies with Adam Sandler in them, but the ones I've seen, I've liked them, so I thought, hey, Adam's in a gay movie, great!...I guess to the eyes of most straights who are not that involved in the gay thing, the jokes in the movie were awesome.. yeah... it's all stereotypes and we make fun of the stereotypes everywhere... but that is the thing... while stereotypes are made fun of, they don't really educate, clarify, or any similar, and that, to the gay community is something very crucial at this point of the history... At this point, the gay community NEEDS that the mainstream knows what homosexuality REALLY is..The movie presents gays as all being sissies, effeminate, girly, etc... come to think of it... even the grumpy fireman who turned out to be gay (being the reason to all his anger, as he was afraid of coming out) ended up being a sissie..Now, don't take me wrong... sissies have nothing wrong... they're actually fabulous, and they are PART of the DIVERSITY of the gay community... but they are not the total... there are a HUGE more types of people, just like in the "straight community" and it's not fair that we gays are always thought of as girly guys who squeal when they see a mouse, once again, not because there's something wrong with that, but because it's just not the way everyone is... after all, everyone is entitled to individuality.Some of you have seen it, for example, in the "Brokeback Mountain" film. Those two cowboys, being bisexual both of them, were not at all sissies, but there wasn't much problem with that movie in the sense that it dealed with only two... however this time in the Adam Sandler movie ALL LGBT people is presented as being gay...catch my grip?

OK it is full of stereotypes, yes the movie does old jokes, it is fairly predictable and we have seen it before. The crucial question is this  is it funny? The simple answer is yes. My wife wasn't enthused about this one, but she laughed heartily. For a comedy to be any good you need to laugh out loud at least 6 times. I think I laughed about 10-12 times. Some of the scenes were set up really well and the comedy acting was superb.OK the plot is unbelievable and a little silly, but it's a comedy! Give it a go. If you love meet the parents, dumb and dumber, there is something about Mary and Kingpin, you will enjoy the show. If you have a cinematic bypass and love politically correct left-wing tripe  then this one isn't for you. Its as simple as that!

OK so there was some things i did like n sh*t but it could have been betterLike, maybe make this a story about chuck coming to terms with his true sexuality through this fake marriage (maybe have chuck actually have feelings for Larry but pretends like he doesn't and sleeps with a bunch of women to assure himself hes "straight" And maybe Larry falls for chuck tooMaybe this fake relationship could turn into a real oneId put this on my blog but i don't want anyone knowing i watched this movie

This might just have been the worst film I've ever seen. It is not a comedy, not at all, because the jokes in it is just NOT funny, they are so cheap and easy that you would believe that someone wrote the script in one hour and fifty minutes! The fact that this film's got 6.2 on IMDb is simply quite disturbing and makes me wonder how stupid people these days are! I felt it as my responsibility to warn other potential watchers of this film, PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT! And what the heck is up with Adam Sandler! He have to be the worst actor ever, and he seems to appear in all the wrong movies! And don't listen do them who thinks this is an excellent movie, they are either idiots or they have been doing something else than watching the film...
