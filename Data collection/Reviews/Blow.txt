I don't understand why many people I talked to either thought the film was bad or mediocre.  Sure, it isn't a "great" movie, but when was the last time you saw 5 great movies in a row?  A great movie comes along once in a blue moon, depending on your definition of great.  I personally was very engaged in the plot.  Johnny Depp gives a tour-de-force performance, fully engaging himself in the character.  I'm sure he did lots of research on George Jung and tried to mimick his every mannerism, because this was far from a half-baked effort.  Then again, I don't ever recall Johnny Depp doing a movie where he didn't put his full enthusiasm into the role.  The movie has many tragic moments and many funny moments.  The film is a little over 2 hours long, but the time flew by in a breeze.  I was so enlightened that I'm anxious to do some research on the real George Jung.  I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, and they could've chosen a much better actress, but she's only in the film about 20 or 30 minutes, so she isn't given enough time to ruin the film.  Paul Reubens gives a surprisingly earnest performance as a flamboyant, bisexual hairdresser.  It's too bad he's caught up in all this controversy, because he seems to have sufficient range as an actor.  I loved hearing all the great classic rock songs in the soundtrack, and every time I watch the film the songs get stuck in my head and I start singing them for days on end.  "Blow" is a touching drama that doesn't try to exploit the world of drugs, nor condemn it.  After seeing George's tragic outcomes as a world-class coke dealer, I doubt anyone would want to get in or get back into the "business," but that doesn't necessarily mean the message is preachy. 
My score:  8 (out of 10)

The effects of lacking the fortitude and conscience to make the right choices in life are examined in `Blow,' directed by Ted Demme and starring Johnny Depp as George Jung, a young New Englander who decides early on that living week to week and barely being able to make ends meet is not the kind of life he wants.  George grew up in the 50s, in a decent, middle-class family, but was deeply affected by the fact that his father, Fred (Ray Liotta), worked his fingers to the bone as a plumber, sometimes fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, and it was never enough, especially for his mother, Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who complained endlessly about not having enough money.  More than once she abandoned her family, only to be taken back every time upon her return by Fred, who adored her.  Then, in the late 60s, George, along with his childhood friend, Tuna (Ethan Suplee), moved to Southern California and quickly discovered the freedom of the beaches and a lifestyle conducive to his idea of paradise.  That `paradise' being anchored in the realization of the big, easy money to be made at the time selling marijuana; and for George, it was only the beginning, the on-ramp to the freeway that would ultimately take him to the top of his `profession,' and which was destined to define his life.  	It's a tale as old as time, the lesson of which is destined forever-- unfortunately-- to be ignored by those who seek the quick and easy road to wealth and happiness.  Courage, it has been said, has many faces; one kind earns soldiers and citizens medals for rising above imminent danger. Another can be defined as being able to decline the carrot of ill-gotten gains when it is dangled before you.  George lacked that kind of courage, and instead grabbed the promise it proffered with both hands, only to discover-- too late-- that it was empty indeed, and laced with unhappiness. It's a classic rags-to-riches-to-oblivion story, with a moral that will be embraced by those with the wisdom to build their house of brick instead of sticks and straw.	As George, Depp turns in a convincing, believable performance, portraying him as a misguided, rather than `bad' person.  You sense that George's naivete enabled him to take chances and enter an arena to which common sense would otherwise have dictated avoidance, and because of that you are able to sympathize somewhat with him.  Depp lends an innocence to the character in which you can find the kid next door, the good kid you grew up with and knew throughout your school years, and in retrospect, it would seem that George, a reasonably intelligent young man, simply made some very stupid decisions. And, as they say, the prisons are full of those just like him.  But the most telling indication of who George really is and what he could/should have been, comes through his relationship with his father.  And it is that which becomes the very core of the story.	As Fred Jung, Ray Liotta gives a poignant performance, presenting a very real person in a very real setting.  completely avoiding any kind of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen, Liotta plays him with a depth that averts  sentimentality and makes the unconditional love he shows for his son entirely believable.  It's a direct and understated performance that so clearly defines the true character of the man, and it is in the scenes between Liotta and Depp that the true nature of George is revealed as well, in which you begin to understand that he was just an ordinary guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances of his own design.	The supporting cast includes Penelope Cruz (Mirtha), Franka Potente (Barbara), Paul Reubens (Derek Foreal), Jordi Molla (Diego), Cliff Curtis (Escobar) and Max Perlich (Dulli).  A cautionary tale for those who allow themselves to stray from the straight and narrow, the real impact of `Blow' is ultimately contained in the final frame of the film.  It is a still picture of the real George Jung; and to fully realize what his life has been about, you need look no further than into the eyes of the man in that photograph.  I rate this one 8/10.

I find this movie VERY GOOD! In fact, the end nearly brought me to  tears. This movie does something that shouldn't be, but it is. By the  end of the movie, you feel SO SORRY for a drug dealing thief. It's  amazing how they tell the story, and by the end you want to go see this  man and say how sorry you were. I believe that it's one of Johnny's  best roles and really makes you think some. This movie has been  underrated by many people because it's about drugs, but the story is  just a story, but the message it brings and the emotions it triggers,  are lasting. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a Good  Film.

Since not every film can be a great masterpiece, it only stands to reason that there are some which, as good as they are, will never be mentioned in the same breath as The Godfather. Blow happens to be one of those films. In today's market, where films are literally churned out with more attention paid to marketability than merit, it is no surprise that films of almost every subject are saturating the market. Even films about, or based upon, historical crime figures are a dime a dozen these days. The plus to this is that the ones that do come out have to do something special in order to be considered good.Blow's strengths lie in a couple of performances, and the scenes in which George Jung's ability to negotiate his way out of a fix (or into one) are displayed. Johnny Depp plays Jung with a consummate authenticity that, especially when sees the interviews with the real George Jung, literally leaps out of the screen. It's hard to believe this guy who I saw as a fresh-faced semi-nerd in A Nightmare On Elm Street is able to portray such a wide and varied range of characters. Ray Liotta gives him ample support as Fred Jung, showing a man hit hard by his own unsuccessful attempts to keep himself independent and free, therefore fully understanding of how far his son will go to see he doesn't fail in the same endeavour. The final scene with Liotta, where he is listening to the tape recording, is one of the most touching examples of men declaring they cannot regret their defiance seen on film.The scenes with Pablo Escobar are especially amusing. As we see how George was able to charm his way into any deal he set his mind to, one cannot help but admire the man. Merely standing before the most powerful drug lord in South America at that time would have taken more guts than most people are allotted. The Jungian method of keeping oneself calm while smuggling through customs, even if completely fictional, sums up this this calmness in the face of danger quite brilliantly.But, and it seems there always is a but with Hollywood product these days, some aspects of the film are terrible. Penélope Cruz is absolutely horrible as Mirtha Jung, and it is hard to believe that someone as cocky and bold as George would tolerate her presence. I've heard Salma Hayek (or horse-jaw as she is probably better-known) suggested for the part, but she is just as bad. Given how many actresses there are in Spain who would appreciate a break, and know a mode of speech other than screaming, one can't help but wish the director could have shown a bit of Jungian testicular fortitude and cast an unknown.Adding to the film's woes is the end of the story. Compared to the first two thirds, where we seem to be going along at the speed of one of Jung's sports cars, the whole thread about Jung's inability to live without contact with his daughter brings affairs to a screeching halt. That Christina Jung has never visited her father, at least according to the ending crawl, is a pretty sad fact. What's even worse is that after viewing this film, we never learn anything about Christina. We don't learn if the cocaine abuse on her mother's part during pregnancy had any ill effects, or whether she has led a life she would call satisfactory. She is little more than a prop. The fact that Jaime King, the actress who played her during the final wrap-up, is a recovering heroin addict only makes one wonder more. Especially among those of us who really have to live with permanent physical damage that may have been caused by parental drug abuse during in utero development (even if it was only nicotine in my mother's case).In all, I gave Blow an eight out of ten. If you want to know anything about George Jung and how cocaine got to be such a hot item in America, then this film does make some excellent points. With the poor economy in America where blue-collar workers are in borderline poverty while CEOs rip them off something blind, it really is a wonder we aren't seeing the rise of an army composed of George Jung wannabes.

Not a bad movie, above average, but nothing extraordinary, nothing that could even remotely be compared with for example, Scarface.In my opinion the main 'problem' with this motion picture is that Depp is never really believable as a hardened drug dealer, there is no way that the real George Jung was ever even remotely like that. The proof of this is in the last frame of the movie where we see the real George's face staring at us from the screen. At that precise moment we know: the real George Jung was very, very different, his face tells us that.On the other hand, Paul Reubens is excellent as Derek Foreal and the very good soundtrack is also worthy of mention. All in all, a good movie definitely worth watching, but also a movie that could have been much much better.

`On your mark! Get set and blow!' And prepare yourself to one of the most provocative and entertaining films you will see all year. `Blow' stars Johnny Depp and is based upon the real life story of drug dealer George Jung. Depp's performance as Jung was outstanding and proves again why his outstanding diverse acting is all that is `cracked' up to be.  Ray Liotta was just as good as the trusting father. However, Penelope Cruz as the materialistic drug dealer wife was not a woman on top with her acting. The most surprisingly energetic performance was by Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee-Wee Herman) who was once again a master of his domain as the drug dealing homosexual middleman (in more ways than one). All in all, this is one `blow' that does the job right! **** Good

Based on a true story of how the American cocaine market was founded, this is a lot more funky than I had expected. A thumpingly good soundtrack right from the start and Johnny Depp cruising in to be a convincingly laid-back big-shot - almost like a graduate from Boogie Nights. Penelope Cruz manages to be blisteringly erotic in a few well-crafted scenes and without removing a stitch of clothing. Later, instead of following the usual pattern of despair in the second half where most drug movies home in on drug dependency, Blow refreshingly focuses on the emotional losses suffered by the characters. A film that just about manages to be more than the sum of its parts, it would have made a nice sort of pre-quel to Traffic, but it stands alone in fine form. And it's moving rather than depressing.

That statement was said by Denis Leary who, not surprisingly, co-produced this drug epic with Ted Demme who not only directs this film, but Leary's special No Cure for Cancer. Watching that special, I would've never expected a movie this good and serious, but it is. And unless a better film comes along this year, Blow might just be the best film of 2001.In this bio-pic, George Jung is a guy who starts out by selling pot in the California area. After a while though, he progresses to selling cocaine in the late 70's and early 80's with the infamous Pablo Ecobar, and becomes a multi-millionaire (Jung, played by Jonny Depp very well, explains that if you bought cocaine in that time period in America, there would be a 85 percent chance it was from him). But then we see how things change with time, especially with Jung, which makes this movie even more fascinating and excellent.While Blow is stylish, smart and hard edged with good stuff, the film also has compassion and feeling, in-particular in the third act which gives this movie a clever turn. Also with brilliant acting from the cast (the ensemble includes Depp, Paul Ruebens, Penelope Cruz and in a twist of a role from GoodFellas, Ray Liotta as Jung's dad) and a well told story, this is one of the best bio-pics and drug movies of the 00's.

"Blow" is basically a glorification of the drug trade.  Principles are shown in a glamorous light throughout most of the movie.  They get all the girls and are awash in money.  Even after they are arrested and confined to prison their only real crime portrayed is the loss of family life and strained relations with parents.  In prison George Jung is portrayed as a counter culture icon, a wronged, flawed hero. The negative effects of the drugs upon the society as a whole are never broached.  The killings, the crime, the destroyed lives, the waste are not examined.  It is truly a movie about our times.   A valuable movie to watch to see what has happened to our moral compass.  It is another Hollywood view of the state of the union.

*** 1/2 out of ****This is a remarkable film about a remarkable story based on a remarkable life. I am surprised by the number of critics. Does this film try and glorify the drug dealer? No. Is George Jung a hero? No. Is the film's purpose to make him one? No. This is why I have problems with a majority of the critics of this excellent film. Why the criticism? The subject matter? The fact that it was based on a true story?At any rate, back to the film, which is wonderfully shot backed up by great performances from Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta and Jordi Molla. The film is told from a narrative perspective by George Jung (Johnny Depp) tracing the spectacular rise and fall of the pioneering US cocaine distributor of the 70 / 80s.The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. The sets, costumes and music all work perfectly.The audience takes an incredible journey, pulled into a world of drug smuggling / distributing, the illusion of 'easy money', ensuing greed and finally betrayal. While many are quick to point out the fact that this person was a "drug dealer" and ponder, "why feel sorry for him?", this misses the point IMO. His story doesn't search for sympathy from the audience, although it is a sad one. It is an unapologetic look at an unapologetic life.The greatest takeaway from his experience was that he realized too late what was truly important in his life. Simple things, not the money, not the cars, but "real" things as foreshadowed by his father's speech to him as a child. A point that is continually being underscored by his father's unconditional love (wonderfully played by Ray Liotta, a refreshing character change for him) and culminates in his own unconditional love for his daughter - although he is too late to recieve it.*** minor spoilers ahead ***Notable scenes in the movie include:The beginning of the "US cocaine explosion" after meeting Pablo - the stylish kaleidoscopic montage of single shot images brilliantly captures the essence of that era, underscored by the song "Blinded by the Light" in the backgroundJolla's solid performance as the two-faced 'Judas' Diego is highlighted in the powerful coke-induced scene where admits his betrayal to George.Johnny Depp is tremendous as usual. His understated performances are growing on me with every picture. This contrasts harshly with Penelope Cruz's performances which I have found to be increasingly annoying with each performance.Lastly, the sad irony of this film is that it is also now a self-tribute to a rising film maker who could not himself escape the dangers of cocaine.Ted Demme RIP.

I watched this adaptation of Bruce Porter's novel "Blow" having read most of the book. As a film alone, it is passable. But as an adaptation of truly attention-getting material, it is a sorry failure. Based on the true-life of George Jung who created an empire in the United States by dealing cocaine, the film starts off on the wrong footing and continues to descend into a white-wash of the events of George Jung's life.Director Ted Demme takes Jung's life and creates artificial sympathy for the character making the film a tragedy of circumstance rather than of choice. However, George Jung himself admitted that the only reason he chose to be a cocaine dealer was that times were slow and he needed the money. Demme also turns Jung's mother into an uncaring villain who turns her son into the cops and taunts him as he is led away, when in reality Jung really doesn't know who turned him in. The film also looks over the fact that George had a well-paying job when he decided to enter the world of drug trafficking. It is of no surprise that director Ted Demme sympathized with Jung considering Demme's own cocaine related death less than a year later.What was advertised and initially appeared to be a truly engaging exploration of the world of cocaine dealing turned out to be a very typical Hollywood film about drug dealing. With music video cinematography and underwhelming performances by Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and most of the remaining cast, Blow doesn't come close to expanding or improving upon countless other films exploring the same topic. It falls quickly into the Hollywood glamor trap and never ascends to anything more than typical.

Blow (2001) is a movie I recently watched on Tubi and is one of my favorite drug movies all time. The storyline showcases an American who was really good at struggling and keeping his mouth shut about his connections. He ends up doing so well that Pablo Escobar contracts with him to smuggle drugs into the United States just as crack/cocaine was becoming a major thing. Everyone makes more money than they can imagine. How long can the American maintain this lifestyle as his life expands into a wife and family? This movie is directed by Ted Demme (Life) and stars Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands), Ray Liotta (Goodfellas), Paul Reunbens (Peewee Herman), Penelope Cruz (Vanilla Sky), Bobcat Goldwait (Police Academy) and Rachel Griffiths (The Rookie). The storyline for this is incredible. It's hard to believe it was based on true events. The settings and characters were so fascinating and the writing was really smart and showed the evolution of the characters over time. The cast couldn't have been better selected and everyone delivers an A+ performance. This is an easy 10/10 and must see.

I wanted to like "Blow" a lot more than I did, as I am a major devotee of the rise-and-fall drug movie subgenre.  However, despite another effortlessly excellent performance from Johnny Depp, this film fails to add up to more than the sum of its parts.The story told here spans decades, and chronicles the familiar story of the dizzying rise within the drug trade, the opulent excess, the unheeded warning signs of violence and loss, and the final fall, resulting in emotional devastation.  Individual moments in the film are affecting, especially in the last third, when Depp's character attempts to go straight and win back his daughter. These scenes reveal a side to this oft-told story that are not always evident in other films.  But unfortunately, the structure of the film is a mess, and the timing is all off.  Somehow, I felt myself longing to see more depth of character, for the writers and directors to spend more time with each scene, while at the same time feeling boredom and restlessness due to my inability to become fully engaged by each new scene or character--the story being told is big and long, and the filmmakers clearly do not have a real handle on it.Lack of focus and a clear sense of direction are the film's greatest flaws, and these overshadow more favorable elements, including a fresh visual take on the party-time 70s setting:  This film eschews the glossy disco sheen of so many of the recent films about this era with a dingy, sun-baked vision.  Glamour is noticeably missing from "Blow," a fact that I both admire and find refreshing.Other bright moments include a subtly hilarious cameo from Bobcat Goldthwaite, as well as other strong supporting performances, and a calm, unhurried, and believable portrayal of the relationship between Depp and his father, played by the always-dependable Ray Liotta.  However, the performance by Penelope Cruz is unbelievably shrill, manic, and off-putting.  She comes off as a deranged harpie, a one-dimensional coke fiend. I wonder if there was far more meat to Cruz's performance before director Ted Demme began editing heavily to keep the film under 3 hours.  Cruz's work has been promising so far, so I wonder if she is solely to blame for a truly awful performance.A sign of a film that misses the mark in a fundamental way is its ability to constantly remind you of similar but far better films. "Blow" does this, and it only makes clear how unsuccessful the film is.  This film owes a debt to "GoodFellas" and "Boogie Nights," as well as a number of other films, but suffers greatly by comparison.  It lacks the vitality, originality, and skill of "Traffic," and the existence of these inevitable comparisons only makes it clearer that "Blow" is bluntly put together, deeply flawed, and an uninteresting take on an important and fascinating topic.

Johnny Depp, (George Jung),"The Libertine",'04 played an eager young guy who wanted to out do his father in many ways in life, especially making more money and satisfying his wife. When George Jung was growing up, his father and mother always fought about not enough money and his mom seemed to always dominate his poor dad. Penelope Cruz,"Sahara",'05, played the wife of George and was a complete knock out with her good looks and great acting skills. George Jung hit the top of his chosen career with rooms filled with millions of dollars and lots of white powder to blow up the nostrils. If you like pictures dealing with drugs and the outcome of enjoying this junk, this is the picture for you. Johnny Depp, gave an outstanding performance and put his heart and soul into this role.

Great movie, Depp is typically awesome and way too cool for school. But, don't watch it as a historical biopic, coz it's not. It's "based" on a true story. Watch it as a fictional, entertaining movie with a very dramatic, moving ending. The real George Jung was NOT Johnny Depp-cool and is worthy of no sympathy at all. He was a greedy, manipulative, money-grubbing drug dealer and the film conveniently leaves out the FACT that he and his partner, Diego, actually MURDERED several people who interfered with their business, and destroyed countless other lives directly or indirectly through the incredible amounts of cocaine they sold. He got 60 years in Otisville because he deserved 60 years in Otisville.That aside, this movie has a coolness factor that has assured its place in my collection.Notables: Depp's airport-walk to the tune of "Black Betty", the Mexico "i don't need a little, a need a LOT" scene, and all the California stuff ("I'm a stewardess...i'm a stewardess...im a stewardess..."

You would never believe that the story of a drug lord could be so interesting but it is. While the film may not be 100% accurate it is a fairly good depiction of the life of George Jung.The story tells the tale of Jung's childhood, how his family became flat broke, how and why Jung decided that drugs was to be his way of life and Jung's rise to the top of drug world as well as his downfall.The movie has quite a bit of action, a good biographical story to tell, intense drama and a good casting. I enjoyed the film very much and do recommend it to not only fans of Johnny Depp but to those that are interested in biographical films and crime-dramas.8/10

Director Ted Demme gives us an engrossing look at the very high highs and lowest of lows in the life of one of America's pioneer cocaine dealers George Jung(Johnny Depp). This story spans three decades: starting with Jung happy just to buy and sell 'pot'; being the first gringo to move cocaine into America from Pablo Escobar's Colombian cartel; and daydreaming while tending a garden in Federal prison. Jung lived life in the fast lane with the best of them. Soon there was trouble in paradise that led to life on the run from the FBI and DEA.Depp is to be commended on his superb job in the challenging lead role and holding an awkward script together. Cliff Curtis is the stern and powerful Escobar. Ray Liotta is Jung's passive, but concerned father. Paul "Pee Wee" Reubens is Jung's back stabbing gay friend/dealer. Jordi Molla is Diego, Jung's ruthless partner and former cell mate. Penelope Cruz is Jung's wife Mirtha that lives for three things: cocaine, sex and money. I am not impressed with anything that Miss Cruz brings to the movie. The most disliked character in this movie is Jung's snob of a mother played by Rachel Griffiths.This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but those who view the movie will have the story lingering in their thoughts. Violence and profanity are scattered about in this sometimes disjointed tale.

Johnny Depp gives a fantastic performance as George Jung, a real-life drug dealer whose story is embodied in the 2001 film "Blow." Depp also narrates as the viewer is brought through how drugs brought George a life most people only dream of living while it took away the only things that matter.The story spans 30 years and focuses on George's relationship with his parents (Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths), his early marijuana supplier (Paul Reubens), and first crowd of friends and spans his various imprisonments, a shift from marijuana to cocaine, involvements with cartels in South America, his marriage and the birth of his daughter.Ted Demme, with the help of Depp's multilayered performance, weaves a very engrossing story here. I agree with one of the comments here - the last thing I would have expected was for a film like this to bring me to tears, but Depp's final scene does. A sad morality tale, excellently told. Highly recommended.

There's something relentlessly self-serving about the (auto)biographies of criminals. There are too many plays for sympathy; a certain neatness in the way events always seem to absolve the criminal of blame; a sense of something being laid on a little too thick. So it is with 'Blow'.George Jung, as played by Johnny Depp, is a perpetual ingenue. His character is a catalogue of good looks and sweet gestures, and he has a downright saintliness in his dealings with others that's so slick and saccharine that one can see the con coming from miles away. George is kind to his friends, generous to his business partners, oddly enough always the victim and never the perpetrator of double crossings, and by God, he loves his daughter. I was disappointed that there were no scenes of Johnny Depp administering aid to wounded animals, but it's possible that these were cut to allow the film to run its current six hours in length.While there's a certain low humour in watching film-makers unknowingly playing the role of patsies, the warped and jagged caricatures Jung's narrative makes of the other people in his story (the better to portray him as Christ) soon nip any fun in the bud. George's mother (Rachel Griffiths, utterly wasted) is a cold, insatiate bitch; his wife (Penelope Cruz, hysterical) is a coke-mad, tantrum throwing ingrate, and his West Coast distributor (Paul Reubens, the less said the better) is a limp wristed fairy (largely, I suspect, so as not to threaten George's position as the film's only sympathetic, attractive, non-ethnic heterosexual male). It's notable that the only female close to Jung who gets anything like a good rap is his flower-child stewardess fiancee Barbara, who rather conveniently drops dead before her relations with him have a chance to sour.While it's not exactly unentertaining - the film's early-mid section works well as an evocation of sunlit good times - 'Blow's' inherent manipulativeness is never far beneath the surface. Once things go bad for Jung, the film starts to sag in sympathy (literally) with him, and becomes instead a chronicle of Bad and Unjust Things Suffered with Commendable Stoicism by George Jung. My advice would be to have already left the theatre by this point. The ending is painfully overblown and drawn out, and we are forced to endure one of the more 'off' moments in recent cinema as the film primly castigates Jung's daughter for not visiting her father in jail. I'm sure she has her reasons.

Not a minute goes by in Blow that doesn't feel reminiscent of Goodfellas. But whereas Scorsese's movie, was fiery, witty, credible, and involving this one is cumbersome, overlong, and contrived.Blow starts off strong and ends strong, but the hour and a half in between is burdened by a sense of repetition, an inability to flesh out character, and the story duration (which covers about two to three decades in the life of American Cocaine entrepreneur George Jung) ages badly. It cheats the viewer by using montage to cover vast periods of time in which explanation and exposition are denied, and Johnny Depp is aged using the most phony looking wigs I've seen in ages. Jung goes from zero to hero in a matter of seconds, and his daughter ages ten years in four shots. Unlike Goodfellas, Blow is too seldomly grounded in direction, making it difficult for the viewer to invest in on a consistent basis. It has it's moments to be sure, but it didn't do enough for me to recommend it.

The best part about this movie is it's based on a true story yet still feels originally created. The adaption to the big screen was very well done from the production to the acting. I think it's a signature notable movie of the 2000s.

BLOW / (2001) **** (out of four)By Blake French:	I don't think George Jung was a corrupt, sleazy drug smuggler, but, more or less, a young businessman making money to support his family and wild lifestyle. That is what makes Ted Demme's "Blow" different from other drug movies-it does not portray its characters as addicted lowlifes, but as recklessly successful, high powered individuals who simply want to live the American dream. The film is based on the true story of George Jung, whose image went from the average Joe next door, a high-school football star from a small Massachusetts town, to the world's premiere importer of cocaine from Colombia's Medellin cartel, who once supplied the States with over 85% of the total amount of imported cocaine in the 1970's and 80's. "Blow" is one of the best movies of the year.	"Blow" covers a wide range of generations and locations, ranging from the turbulent 60's to the haze of the 80's, and from such areas of the North America like Massachusetts, Florida, Colombia, California, Mexico, New York and Illinois. The time and location span provided the filmmakers with a challenge. The film was shot in a variety of locations in Southern California and in Mexico. "It was a difficult film to schedule and shoot because it had so many different time periods. And since it was the story of a man's life, every scene was fairly brief which meant an incredible number of scenes to be shot," explains executive producer Georgia Kacandes.
	Covering so many years in a single film also tests the ability of the film's costume designers and makeup artists. The wardrobes, makeup and hair styles appear authentic and  impressive. This movie pays close attention to even some of the most minute of details. 	George Jung's motives for pursuing drugs may have been triggered by his family life as a child. His father was a nobody construction worker who often struggled with money and his marriage. In the film, Ray Liotta plays George's poor but content father, with the versatile Rachel Griffiths as his bitter, unhappy mother. George vows to never live his life in poverty, no matter what. 	He moves to California as a young adult where selling marijuana supports his independent lifestyle. Paul Reubens and Ethan Suplee play George's drug-dealing comrades. Eventually, the authorities send him to prison for a while, where he meets Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla). An insider in Colombia's rising drug trade, this man educates George about the profits of selling cocaine. After serving his time, Jung becomes partners with Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis), the billionaire godfather of international cocaine trafficking.	"Blow" displays a consistent and detailed portrait of the spectacular rise, and dramatic fall, of Jung and his travel towards turning powder cocaine into American's biggest drug problem. Ted Demme's direction is vivid, determined, and stylish. He reportedly conducted many interviews with the real life George Jung, as he makes very clear the early high life, and the dangerous reality of a drug smuggler's everyday lifestyle. Demme is careful to stay away from frequent potential distractions, like the drug use, side characters, family issues, and romantic interests. This is a vivid narrative of a very interesting character. It does display a message about drugs that we have seen before, but never in this stylishly innovative light.
Laced with amusing detail and probing awareness, "Blow" defies the usual road of drug movies and provides us with tension and interest from Jung's many experiences-risky border crossings, ferocious consultation, unexpected deception, the persistence of the authorities, and unconquerable temptations. But untimely the film shows the true tragedy of losing your dreams to greed and drugs. Johnny Depp proves once again what a triumphant, adaptable actor he can be. He portrays George Jung with the perfect amount of greed, style, confusion, pride, and desperation. The real George Jung is in a prison cell in New York. Without possibility of parole, Jung's release date is scheduled for 2015. Depp acknowledged the responsibility that comes with dramatizing a true individual, but also the responsibility of the director. "I knew Ted was committed to the film, but I didn't understand how deeply committed he was to the real George.""Blow" becomes one of the most intriguing movies of 2001, but it even suffers in comparison to the incomprehensible achievement director Darren Aronofsky accomplished last year with his disturbingly real display of the downward spiral of four drug addicts in "Requiem for a Dream." That film gave us a cinematic taste of what drug addicts experience through their addictions and depravity. "Blow" still shines a fresh new light on drugs in movies, and perceptively portrays the story of a person from whom many can learn.

I don't understand why many people I talked to either thought the film was bad or mediocre.  Sure, it isn't a "great" movie, but when was the last time you saw 5 great movies in a row?  A great movie comes along once in a blue moon, depending on your definition of great.  I personally was very engaged in the plot.  Johnny Depp gives a tour-de-force performance, fully engaging himself in the character.  I'm sure he did lots of research on George Jung and tried to mimick his every mannerism, because this was far from a half-baked effort.  Then again, I don't ever recall Johnny Depp doing a movie where he didn't put his full enthusiasm into the role.  The movie has many tragic moments and many funny moments.  The film is a little over 2 hours long, but the time flew by in a breeze.  I was so enlightened that I'm anxious to do some research on the real George Jung.  I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, and they could've chosen a much better actress, but she's only in the film about 20 or 30 minutes, so she isn't given enough time to ruin the film.  Paul Reubens gives a surprisingly earnest performance as a flamboyant, bisexual hairdresser.  It's too bad he's caught up in all this controversy, because he seems to have sufficient range as an actor.  I loved hearing all the great classic rock songs in the soundtrack, and every time I watch the film the songs get stuck in my head and I start singing them for days on end.  "Blow" is a touching drama that doesn't try to exploit the world of drugs, nor condemn it.  After seeing George's tragic outcomes as a world-class coke dealer, I doubt anyone would want to get in or get back into the "business," but that doesn't necessarily mean the message is preachy. 
My score:  8 (out of 10)

The effects of lacking the fortitude and conscience to make the right choices in life are examined in `Blow,' directed by Ted Demme and starring Johnny Depp as George Jung, a young New Englander who decides early on that living week to week and barely being able to make ends meet is not the kind of life he wants.  George grew up in the 50s, in a decent, middle-class family, but was deeply affected by the fact that his father, Fred (Ray Liotta), worked his fingers to the bone as a plumber, sometimes fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, and it was never enough, especially for his mother, Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who complained endlessly about not having enough money.  More than once she abandoned her family, only to be taken back every time upon her return by Fred, who adored her.  Then, in the late 60s, George, along with his childhood friend, Tuna (Ethan Suplee), moved to Southern California and quickly discovered the freedom of the beaches and a lifestyle conducive to his idea of paradise.  That `paradise' being anchored in the realization of the big, easy money to be made at the time selling marijuana; and for George, it was only the beginning, the on-ramp to the freeway that would ultimately take him to the top of his `profession,' and which was destined to define his life.  	It's a tale as old as time, the lesson of which is destined forever-- unfortunately-- to be ignored by those who seek the quick and easy road to wealth and happiness.  Courage, it has been said, has many faces; one kind earns soldiers and citizens medals for rising above imminent danger. Another can be defined as being able to decline the carrot of ill-gotten gains when it is dangled before you.  George lacked that kind of courage, and instead grabbed the promise it proffered with both hands, only to discover-- too late-- that it was empty indeed, and laced with unhappiness. It's a classic rags-to-riches-to-oblivion story, with a moral that will be embraced by those with the wisdom to build their house of brick instead of sticks and straw.	As George, Depp turns in a convincing, believable performance, portraying him as a misguided, rather than `bad' person.  You sense that George's naivete enabled him to take chances and enter an arena to which common sense would otherwise have dictated avoidance, and because of that you are able to sympathize somewhat with him.  Depp lends an innocence to the character in which you can find the kid next door, the good kid you grew up with and knew throughout your school years, and in retrospect, it would seem that George, a reasonably intelligent young man, simply made some very stupid decisions. And, as they say, the prisons are full of those just like him.  But the most telling indication of who George really is and what he could/should have been, comes through his relationship with his father.  And it is that which becomes the very core of the story.	As Fred Jung, Ray Liotta gives a poignant performance, presenting a very real person in a very real setting.  completely avoiding any kind of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen, Liotta plays him with a depth that averts  sentimentality and makes the unconditional love he shows for his son entirely believable.  It's a direct and understated performance that so clearly defines the true character of the man, and it is in the scenes between Liotta and Depp that the true nature of George is revealed as well, in which you begin to understand that he was just an ordinary guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances of his own design.	The supporting cast includes Penelope Cruz (Mirtha), Franka Potente (Barbara), Paul Reubens (Derek Foreal), Jordi Molla (Diego), Cliff Curtis (Escobar) and Max Perlich (Dulli).  A cautionary tale for those who allow themselves to stray from the straight and narrow, the real impact of `Blow' is ultimately contained in the final frame of the film.  It is a still picture of the real George Jung; and to fully realize what his life has been about, you need look no further than into the eyes of the man in that photograph.  I rate this one 8/10.

I find this movie VERY GOOD! In fact, the end nearly brought me to  tears. This movie does something that shouldn't be, but it is. By the  end of the movie, you feel SO SORRY for a drug dealing thief. It's  amazing how they tell the story, and by the end you want to go see this  man and say how sorry you were. I believe that it's one of Johnny's  best roles and really makes you think some. This movie has been  underrated by many people because it's about drugs, but the story is  just a story, but the message it brings and the emotions it triggers,  are lasting. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a Good  Film.

Since not every film can be a great masterpiece, it only stands to reason that there are some which, as good as they are, will never be mentioned in the same breath as The Godfather. Blow happens to be one of those films. In today's market, where films are literally churned out with more attention paid to marketability than merit, it is no surprise that films of almost every subject are saturating the market. Even films about, or based upon, historical crime figures are a dime a dozen these days. The plus to this is that the ones that do come out have to do something special in order to be considered good.Blow's strengths lie in a couple of performances, and the scenes in which George Jung's ability to negotiate his way out of a fix (or into one) are displayed. Johnny Depp plays Jung with a consummate authenticity that, especially when sees the interviews with the real George Jung, literally leaps out of the screen. It's hard to believe this guy who I saw as a fresh-faced semi-nerd in A Nightmare On Elm Street is able to portray such a wide and varied range of characters. Ray Liotta gives him ample support as Fred Jung, showing a man hit hard by his own unsuccessful attempts to keep himself independent and free, therefore fully understanding of how far his son will go to see he doesn't fail in the same endeavour. The final scene with Liotta, where he is listening to the tape recording, is one of the most touching examples of men declaring they cannot regret their defiance seen on film.The scenes with Pablo Escobar are especially amusing. As we see how George was able to charm his way into any deal he set his mind to, one cannot help but admire the man. Merely standing before the most powerful drug lord in South America at that time would have taken more guts than most people are allotted. The Jungian method of keeping oneself calm while smuggling through customs, even if completely fictional, sums up this this calmness in the face of danger quite brilliantly.But, and it seems there always is a but with Hollywood product these days, some aspects of the film are terrible. Penélope Cruz is absolutely horrible as Mirtha Jung, and it is hard to believe that someone as cocky and bold as George would tolerate her presence. I've heard Salma Hayek (or horse-jaw as she is probably better-known) suggested for the part, but she is just as bad. Given how many actresses there are in Spain who would appreciate a break, and know a mode of speech other than screaming, one can't help but wish the director could have shown a bit of Jungian testicular fortitude and cast an unknown.Adding to the film's woes is the end of the story. Compared to the first two thirds, where we seem to be going along at the speed of one of Jung's sports cars, the whole thread about Jung's inability to live without contact with his daughter brings affairs to a screeching halt. That Christina Jung has never visited her father, at least according to the ending crawl, is a pretty sad fact. What's even worse is that after viewing this film, we never learn anything about Christina. We don't learn if the cocaine abuse on her mother's part during pregnancy had any ill effects, or whether she has led a life she would call satisfactory. She is little more than a prop. The fact that Jaime King, the actress who played her during the final wrap-up, is a recovering heroin addict only makes one wonder more. Especially among those of us who really have to live with permanent physical damage that may have been caused by parental drug abuse during in utero development (even if it was only nicotine in my mother's case).In all, I gave Blow an eight out of ten. If you want to know anything about George Jung and how cocaine got to be such a hot item in America, then this film does make some excellent points. With the poor economy in America where blue-collar workers are in borderline poverty while CEOs rip them off something blind, it really is a wonder we aren't seeing the rise of an army composed of George Jung wannabes.

Not a bad movie, above average, but nothing extraordinary, nothing that could even remotely be compared with for example, Scarface.In my opinion the main 'problem' with this motion picture is that Depp is never really believable as a hardened drug dealer, there is no way that the real George Jung was ever even remotely like that. The proof of this is in the last frame of the movie where we see the real George's face staring at us from the screen. At that precise moment we know: the real George Jung was very, very different, his face tells us that.On the other hand, Paul Reubens is excellent as Derek Foreal and the very good soundtrack is also worthy of mention. All in all, a good movie definitely worth watching, but also a movie that could have been much much better.

`On your mark! Get set and blow!' And prepare yourself to one of the most provocative and entertaining films you will see all year. `Blow' stars Johnny Depp and is based upon the real life story of drug dealer George Jung. Depp's performance as Jung was outstanding and proves again why his outstanding diverse acting is all that is `cracked' up to be.  Ray Liotta was just as good as the trusting father. However, Penelope Cruz as the materialistic drug dealer wife was not a woman on top with her acting. The most surprisingly energetic performance was by Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee-Wee Herman) who was once again a master of his domain as the drug dealing homosexual middleman (in more ways than one). All in all, this is one `blow' that does the job right! **** Good

Based on a true story of how the American cocaine market was founded, this is a lot more funky than I had expected. A thumpingly good soundtrack right from the start and Johnny Depp cruising in to be a convincingly laid-back big-shot - almost like a graduate from Boogie Nights. Penelope Cruz manages to be blisteringly erotic in a few well-crafted scenes and without removing a stitch of clothing. Later, instead of following the usual pattern of despair in the second half where most drug movies home in on drug dependency, Blow refreshingly focuses on the emotional losses suffered by the characters. A film that just about manages to be more than the sum of its parts, it would have made a nice sort of pre-quel to Traffic, but it stands alone in fine form. And it's moving rather than depressing.

That statement was said by Denis Leary who, not surprisingly, co-produced this drug epic with Ted Demme who not only directs this film, but Leary's special No Cure for Cancer. Watching that special, I would've never expected a movie this good and serious, but it is. And unless a better film comes along this year, Blow might just be the best film of 2001.In this bio-pic, George Jung is a guy who starts out by selling pot in the California area. After a while though, he progresses to selling cocaine in the late 70's and early 80's with the infamous Pablo Ecobar, and becomes a multi-millionaire (Jung, played by Jonny Depp very well, explains that if you bought cocaine in that time period in America, there would be a 85 percent chance it was from him). But then we see how things change with time, especially with Jung, which makes this movie even more fascinating and excellent.While Blow is stylish, smart and hard edged with good stuff, the film also has compassion and feeling, in-particular in the third act which gives this movie a clever turn. Also with brilliant acting from the cast (the ensemble includes Depp, Paul Ruebens, Penelope Cruz and in a twist of a role from GoodFellas, Ray Liotta as Jung's dad) and a well told story, this is one of the best bio-pics and drug movies of the 00's.

"Blow" is basically a glorification of the drug trade.  Principles are shown in a glamorous light throughout most of the movie.  They get all the girls and are awash in money.  Even after they are arrested and confined to prison their only real crime portrayed is the loss of family life and strained relations with parents.  In prison George Jung is portrayed as a counter culture icon, a wronged, flawed hero. The negative effects of the drugs upon the society as a whole are never broached.  The killings, the crime, the destroyed lives, the waste are not examined.  It is truly a movie about our times.   A valuable movie to watch to see what has happened to our moral compass.  It is another Hollywood view of the state of the union.

It feels wrong to be sympathetic toward a person who deals drugs for a living, but after watching this movie (being based on a true story)I have a completely different view of George Jung. The first time I watched it, I watched it because I'm a fan of Johnny Depp. I always felt he played his best role in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," however, now it's hard to decipher which was better, his role as Raoul Duke, or George Jung?The story of George Jung's life is a truly amazing one considering he starts out dealing marijuana, and his own mother has him sent to jail, and then he winds up trafficking cocaine with Pablo Escobar, and becoming as rich as Penelope Cruz is beautiful. He finally decides to straighten his life out for his daughter, and winds up back in jail for the rest of his life. The end of this movie is as sad as the story itself. I've never stayed as interested in a movie that was over 2 hours long as I did with this movie. It's a great, climactic story, and I would recommend it to basically ANY movie lover. I don't know a single person who hasn't seen it, and walked away disliking it. Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar. He's an incredible actor, and George Jung was an incredible man.

*** 1/2 out of ****This is a remarkable film about a remarkable story based on a remarkable life. I am surprised by the number of critics. Does this film try and glorify the drug dealer? No. Is George Jung a hero? No. Is the film's purpose to make him one? No. This is why I have problems with a majority of the critics of this excellent film. Why the criticism? The subject matter? The fact that it was based on a true story?At any rate, back to the film, which is wonderfully shot backed up by great performances from Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta and Jordi Molla. The film is told from a narrative perspective by George Jung (Johnny Depp) tracing the spectacular rise and fall of the pioneering US cocaine distributor of the 70 / 80s.The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. The sets, costumes and music all work perfectly.The audience takes an incredible journey, pulled into a world of drug smuggling / distributing, the illusion of 'easy money', ensuing greed and finally betrayal. While many are quick to point out the fact that this person was a "drug dealer" and ponder, "why feel sorry for him?", this misses the point IMO. His story doesn't search for sympathy from the audience, although it is a sad one. It is an unapologetic look at an unapologetic life.The greatest takeaway from his experience was that he realized too late what was truly important in his life. Simple things, not the money, not the cars, but "real" things as foreshadowed by his father's speech to him as a child. A point that is continually being underscored by his father's unconditional love (wonderfully played by Ray Liotta, a refreshing character change for him) and culminates in his own unconditional love for his daughter - although he is too late to recieve it.*** minor spoilers ahead ***Notable scenes in the movie include:The beginning of the "US cocaine explosion" after meeting Pablo - the stylish kaleidoscopic montage of single shot images brilliantly captures the essence of that era, underscored by the song "Blinded by the Light" in the backgroundJolla's solid performance as the two-faced 'Judas' Diego is highlighted in the powerful coke-induced scene where admits his betrayal to George.Johnny Depp is tremendous as usual. His understated performances are growing on me with every picture. This contrasts harshly with Penelope Cruz's performances which I have found to be increasingly annoying with each performance.Lastly, the sad irony of this film is that it is also now a self-tribute to a rising film maker who could not himself escape the dangers of cocaine.Ted Demme RIP.

Good movie. After researching, I am very pleased they stayed true to the real life story. This was mainly due to the involvement of Johnny Depp. They did want to take a lot more liberties with the narrative and imprint that typical Hollywood touch on it before he stepped in. That is ok if you are changing this partially for dramatic purposes. However, I, personally, hate it when they change too many things, as it doesn't do the "true story" any justice. So, a big thanks to Johnny Depp and his insight and professionalism that contributed to this being 95% accurate.Diego Delgado (the character they based on the real life Carlos Lehder) did force out Jung, but this made Jung's own ties and deals with Pablo even closer, as the cartel never liked Lehder. Jung was busted for possession of several pounds of cocaine, that actually was at a birthday party (not sure if it was his?).However, not shown in this film was the details of his deal-How Jung was instructed to testify against Diego (Carlos Lehder) in real life in exchange for a reduced sentence. He refused to rat because of the repercussions he would face from Pablo after witnessing a man get shot in Colombia for his betrayal to Escobar (when Jung met Pablo-depicted in the film at the start). He then changed his mind and was encouraged to testify against Carlos Lehder (Diego) by Pablo Escobar himself as Lehder was negotiating his own deal and going to rat on Pablo and the cartel, hence Jung testifying would destroy Lehders credibility. After his release for testifying, he in the end got screwed over by a former friend working with the D. E. A.A truly great story and film that deserves credit for sticking to the truth. Great performance by Johnny Depp and overall, it was a well directed movie. An interesting snapshot of the crazy life of George Jung. It is mental to see how drastically different people's lives can be, I find stories like these to be fascinating, true story movies done right are often up there as one of the best genres in film. Certainly, one of my favourite genres. A stellar effort!

I watched this adaptation of Bruce Porter's novel "Blow" having read most of the book. As a film alone, it is passable. But as an adaptation of truly attention-getting material, it is a sorry failure. Based on the true-life of George Jung who created an empire in the United States by dealing cocaine, the film starts off on the wrong footing and continues to descend into a white-wash of the events of George Jung's life.Director Ted Demme takes Jung's life and creates artificial sympathy for the character making the film a tragedy of circumstance rather than of choice. However, George Jung himself admitted that the only reason he chose to be a cocaine dealer was that times were slow and he needed the money. Demme also turns Jung's mother into an uncaring villain who turns her son into the cops and taunts him as he is led away, when in reality Jung really doesn't know who turned him in. The film also looks over the fact that George had a well-paying job when he decided to enter the world of drug trafficking. It is of no surprise that director Ted Demme sympathized with Jung considering Demme's own cocaine related death less than a year later.What was advertised and initially appeared to be a truly engaging exploration of the world of cocaine dealing turned out to be a very typical Hollywood film about drug dealing. With music video cinematography and underwhelming performances by Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and most of the remaining cast, Blow doesn't come close to expanding or improving upon countless other films exploring the same topic. It falls quickly into the Hollywood glamor trap and never ascends to anything more than typical.

A Biopic about the American cocaine smuggler George Jung, 'Blow' directed by Ted Demme, showcases & salutes a talent named Johnny Depp. Depp Delivers A Knockout Performance as George Jung! Its a performance that deserves immense respect & admiration.'Blow' is The story of George Jung, the man who established the American cocaine market in the 1970s. 'Blow' is a Depressing Biopic. Its certainly not meant for the faint-hearted. It requires courage & bravery to watch this story, that spells doom right from the very beginning. George Jung's ambition comes across clearly the moment he zeroes on Lucifer. Cinematically, he's a fascinating & disturbing protagonist, who gives inn smoothly. David McKenna & Nick Cassavetes's Screenplay is uninhibited & blunt. Ted Demme's Direction is top-notch. Cinematography & Editing are proper.Depp is simply brilliant. His performance held my interest from beginning to end. Its an under-rated performance, that truly deserved more recognition. I am truly waiting to witness Depp winning an Academy-Award, not just because I am a huge fan, but also because Depp represents fine acting to the Modern-Era of Film. Here's an actor who makes acting look so effortless & groovy, that he inspires me. On the whole, 'Blow' is a must see.

Blow (2001) is a movie I recently watched on Tubi and is one of my favorite drug movies all time. The storyline showcases an American who was really good at struggling and keeping his mouth shut about his connections. He ends up doing so well that Pablo Escobar contracts with him to smuggle drugs into the United States just as crack/cocaine was becoming a major thing. Everyone makes more money than they can imagine. How long can the American maintain this lifestyle as his life expands into a wife and family? This movie is directed by Ted Demme (Life) and stars Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands), Ray Liotta (Goodfellas), Paul Reunbens (Peewee Herman), Penelope Cruz (Vanilla Sky), Bobcat Goldwait (Police Academy) and Rachel Griffiths (The Rookie). The storyline for this is incredible. It's hard to believe it was based on true events. The settings and characters were so fascinating and the writing was really smart and showed the evolution of the characters over time. The cast couldn't have been better selected and everyone delivers an A+ performance. This is an easy 10/10 and must see.

I wanted to like "Blow" a lot more than I did, as I am a major devotee of the rise-and-fall drug movie subgenre.  However, despite another effortlessly excellent performance from Johnny Depp, this film fails to add up to more than the sum of its parts.The story told here spans decades, and chronicles the familiar story of the dizzying rise within the drug trade, the opulent excess, the unheeded warning signs of violence and loss, and the final fall, resulting in emotional devastation.  Individual moments in the film are affecting, especially in the last third, when Depp's character attempts to go straight and win back his daughter. These scenes reveal a side to this oft-told story that are not always evident in other films.  But unfortunately, the structure of the film is a mess, and the timing is all off.  Somehow, I felt myself longing to see more depth of character, for the writers and directors to spend more time with each scene, while at the same time feeling boredom and restlessness due to my inability to become fully engaged by each new scene or character--the story being told is big and long, and the filmmakers clearly do not have a real handle on it.Lack of focus and a clear sense of direction are the film's greatest flaws, and these overshadow more favorable elements, including a fresh visual take on the party-time 70s setting:  This film eschews the glossy disco sheen of so many of the recent films about this era with a dingy, sun-baked vision.  Glamour is noticeably missing from "Blow," a fact that I both admire and find refreshing.Other bright moments include a subtly hilarious cameo from Bobcat Goldthwaite, as well as other strong supporting performances, and a calm, unhurried, and believable portrayal of the relationship between Depp and his father, played by the always-dependable Ray Liotta.  However, the performance by Penelope Cruz is unbelievably shrill, manic, and off-putting.  She comes off as a deranged harpie, a one-dimensional coke fiend. I wonder if there was far more meat to Cruz's performance before director Ted Demme began editing heavily to keep the film under 3 hours.  Cruz's work has been promising so far, so I wonder if she is solely to blame for a truly awful performance.A sign of a film that misses the mark in a fundamental way is its ability to constantly remind you of similar but far better films. "Blow" does this, and it only makes clear how unsuccessful the film is.  This film owes a debt to "GoodFellas" and "Boogie Nights," as well as a number of other films, but suffers greatly by comparison.  It lacks the vitality, originality, and skill of "Traffic," and the existence of these inevitable comparisons only makes it clearer that "Blow" is bluntly put together, deeply flawed, and an uninteresting take on an important and fascinating topic.

Johnny Depp, (George Jung),"The Libertine",'04 played an eager young guy who wanted to out do his father in many ways in life, especially making more money and satisfying his wife. When George Jung was growing up, his father and mother always fought about not enough money and his mom seemed to always dominate his poor dad. Penelope Cruz,"Sahara",'05, played the wife of George and was a complete knock out with her good looks and great acting skills. George Jung hit the top of his chosen career with rooms filled with millions of dollars and lots of white powder to blow up the nostrils. If you like pictures dealing with drugs and the outcome of enjoying this junk, this is the picture for you. Johnny Depp, gave an outstanding performance and put his heart and soul into this role.

Great movie, Depp is typically awesome and way too cool for school. But, don't watch it as a historical biopic, coz it's not. It's "based" on a true story. Watch it as a fictional, entertaining movie with a very dramatic, moving ending. The real George Jung was NOT Johnny Depp-cool and is worthy of no sympathy at all. He was a greedy, manipulative, money-grubbing drug dealer and the film conveniently leaves out the FACT that he and his partner, Diego, actually MURDERED several people who interfered with their business, and destroyed countless other lives directly or indirectly through the incredible amounts of cocaine they sold. He got 60 years in Otisville because he deserved 60 years in Otisville.That aside, this movie has a coolness factor that has assured its place in my collection.Notables: Depp's airport-walk to the tune of "Black Betty", the Mexico "i don't need a little, a need a LOT" scene, and all the California stuff ("I'm a stewardess...i'm a stewardess...im a stewardess..."

You would never believe that the story of a drug lord could be so interesting but it is. While the film may not be 100% accurate it is a fairly good depiction of the life of George Jung.The story tells the tale of Jung's childhood, how his family became flat broke, how and why Jung decided that drugs was to be his way of life and Jung's rise to the top of drug world as well as his downfall.The movie has quite a bit of action, a good biographical story to tell, intense drama and a good casting. I enjoyed the film very much and do recommend it to not only fans of Johnny Depp but to those that are interested in biographical films and crime-dramas.8/10

Director Ted Demme gives us an engrossing look at the very high highs and lowest of lows in the life of one of America's pioneer cocaine dealers George Jung(Johnny Depp). This story spans three decades: starting with Jung happy just to buy and sell 'pot'; being the first gringo to move cocaine into America from Pablo Escobar's Colombian cartel; and daydreaming while tending a garden in Federal prison. Jung lived life in the fast lane with the best of them. Soon there was trouble in paradise that led to life on the run from the FBI and DEA.Depp is to be commended on his superb job in the challenging lead role and holding an awkward script together. Cliff Curtis is the stern and powerful Escobar. Ray Liotta is Jung's passive, but concerned father. Paul "Pee Wee" Reubens is Jung's back stabbing gay friend/dealer. Jordi Molla is Diego, Jung's ruthless partner and former cell mate. Penelope Cruz is Jung's wife Mirtha that lives for three things: cocaine, sex and money. I am not impressed with anything that Miss Cruz brings to the movie. The most disliked character in this movie is Jung's snob of a mother played by Rachel Griffiths.This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but those who view the movie will have the story lingering in their thoughts. Violence and profanity are scattered about in this sometimes disjointed tale.

Johnny Depp gives a fantastic performance as George Jung, a real-life drug dealer whose story is embodied in the 2001 film "Blow." Depp also narrates as the viewer is brought through how drugs brought George a life most people only dream of living while it took away the only things that matter.The story spans 30 years and focuses on George's relationship with his parents (Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths), his early marijuana supplier (Paul Reubens), and first crowd of friends and spans his various imprisonments, a shift from marijuana to cocaine, involvements with cartels in South America, his marriage and the birth of his daughter.Ted Demme, with the help of Depp's multilayered performance, weaves a very engrossing story here. I agree with one of the comments here - the last thing I would have expected was for a film like this to bring me to tears, but Depp's final scene does. A sad morality tale, excellently told. Highly recommended.

There's something relentlessly self-serving about the (auto)biographies of criminals. There are too many plays for sympathy; a certain neatness in the way events always seem to absolve the criminal of blame; a sense of something being laid on a little too thick. So it is with 'Blow'.George Jung, as played by Johnny Depp, is a perpetual ingenue. His character is a catalogue of good looks and sweet gestures, and he has a downright saintliness in his dealings with others that's so slick and saccharine that one can see the con coming from miles away. George is kind to his friends, generous to his business partners, oddly enough always the victim and never the perpetrator of double crossings, and by God, he loves his daughter. I was disappointed that there were no scenes of Johnny Depp administering aid to wounded animals, but it's possible that these were cut to allow the film to run its current six hours in length.While there's a certain low humour in watching film-makers unknowingly playing the role of patsies, the warped and jagged caricatures Jung's narrative makes of the other people in his story (the better to portray him as Christ) soon nip any fun in the bud. George's mother (Rachel Griffiths, utterly wasted) is a cold, insatiate bitch; his wife (Penelope Cruz, hysterical) is a coke-mad, tantrum throwing ingrate, and his West Coast distributor (Paul Reubens, the less said the better) is a limp wristed fairy (largely, I suspect, so as not to threaten George's position as the film's only sympathetic, attractive, non-ethnic heterosexual male). It's notable that the only female close to Jung who gets anything like a good rap is his flower-child stewardess fiancee Barbara, who rather conveniently drops dead before her relations with him have a chance to sour.While it's not exactly unentertaining - the film's early-mid section works well as an evocation of sunlit good times - 'Blow's' inherent manipulativeness is never far beneath the surface. Once things go bad for Jung, the film starts to sag in sympathy (literally) with him, and becomes instead a chronicle of Bad and Unjust Things Suffered with Commendable Stoicism by George Jung. My advice would be to have already left the theatre by this point. The ending is painfully overblown and drawn out, and we are forced to endure one of the more 'off' moments in recent cinema as the film primly castigates Jung's daughter for not visiting her father in jail. I'm sure she has her reasons.

Not a minute goes by in Blow that doesn't feel reminiscent of Goodfellas. But whereas Scorsese's movie, was fiery, witty, credible, and involving this one is cumbersome, overlong, and contrived.Blow starts off strong and ends strong, but the hour and a half in between is burdened by a sense of repetition, an inability to flesh out character, and the story duration (which covers about two to three decades in the life of American Cocaine entrepreneur George Jung) ages badly. It cheats the viewer by using montage to cover vast periods of time in which explanation and exposition are denied, and Johnny Depp is aged using the most phony looking wigs I've seen in ages. Jung goes from zero to hero in a matter of seconds, and his daughter ages ten years in four shots. Unlike Goodfellas, Blow is too seldomly grounded in direction, making it difficult for the viewer to invest in on a consistent basis. It has it's moments to be sure, but it didn't do enough for me to recommend it.

The best part about this movie is it's based on a true story yet still feels originally created. The adaption to the big screen was very well done from the production to the acting. I think it's a signature notable movie of the 2000s.
