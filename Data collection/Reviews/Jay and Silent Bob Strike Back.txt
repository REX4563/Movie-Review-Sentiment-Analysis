For the record, I have not seen Kevin Smith's previous works, Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, or Dogma, which, I'm almost positive, affected how I saw the movie, since Smith puts in so many in-jokes and references to his previous movies, I didn't get them, except for the blatantly obvious ones.Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) hang out in front of a convience store selling weed. When the get a restraining order, they find out that the comic starring their likenesses Bluntman and Chronic is being turned into a Miramax movie. However, they aren't being paid for it, so what to do? Travel cross-country to Hollywood from New Jersey to stop the movie from getting made, what else?Crude, inappropriate, and extremely funny. If there's ever a movie that you should watch with your drinking friends and not with a date or family, this is the one! It has jokes about genetalia, bodily functions, innuendoes, and more, and I haven't laughed this hard at a movie for a long time. Call me immature, but I like this type of stuff, ones that actually have substance behind the crude jokes (not like Old School).Mewes was f-ing hilarious, when he f-ing say the f-ing f-word every f-ing word. It has over 230 f-words along in this movie, with the total number of curses probably around 300. I have never heard so many, but I laughed. I'm not ashamed to admit it: Mewes cracked me up, with his stylish arrogance and foul mouth. Smith, who was laconic for almost the entire film, expressed everything with his eyes, which were funny. There were more cameos than a movie of The Simpsons, with Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, George Carlin, Jamie Kennedy, Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, Joey Lauren Adams, and many, many more.There were many pot-shots of American movies. For instance, when Jay and Silent Bob meet a drug dealer played by Tracy Morgan, he says that Miramax accounts for about 75% of his income. Also, everyone on-screen looks at the camera when they mention, `No one would pay to see a Jay and Silent Bob movie,' and when Ben Affleck says that one reason you do a picture is because you owe a friend a favor. As the Bluntman and Chronic movies premieres, someone says, `Well, it was better than Mallrats.'Are you easily offended? Does the mention of various body parts upset you? If you answered yes to either question, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is not your movie. If you answered no, sit back and enjoy the ride!My rating: 7/10Rated R for nonstop crude and sexual humor, pervasive strong language, and drug content.

Kevin Smith's previous movies always seemed to be something of a mixed bag. Whether ambitious thematically, ("Dogma", "Chasing Amy"), or outright comedy, ("Mallrats"), the movies as a whole were less satisfactory than their many very funny parts. The sporadic appearances of the second string character duo of Jay and Silent Bob were always a welcome event.The big question was whether this 2001 styled Laurel and Hardy, when promoted to center stage, could carry a movie. The answer much to my surprise was a resounding yes. Smith outdoes himself, producing an exceptional comedy. It's consistently inventive, with surprises, in jokes and many cameos from Smith regulars, all who seem to be genuinely having a ball. Never has irreverence and bad language been done with so much charm.Those who disliked Smith's previous works would do well to stay away, they are unlikely to be converted. But for fans, Smith really does deliver the goods, in a big way.I was totally baffled by reading that certain gay groups took offence to this movie. It would seem to me a total misreading as well as a great deficiency in the humor department. Apart from the fact that Smith lampoons all and sundry, it actually struck me as a particularly gay friendly movie. The fact that a gay character sums the movie up as one big gay joke should be taken as a compliment more than anything else.It's clear that this brings Smith's cycle to a close. He couldn't have wished for a better ending.

Writer / editor / director / co-star Kevin Smith gave his infamous title slacker characters this big feature vehicle, in which Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) learn that a big screen adaptation of "Bluntman and Chronic" is happening. Since these comic book characters were based on Jay and Silent Bob, they realize that they SHOULD get a piece of the pie. They then set off on a cross-country odyssey from Jersey to Hollywood, to either get their share of the dough, or else stop the movie from being made.I will grant that this whole thing does play like one giant in-joke, with an impressive roster of cameo appearances (Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, George Carlin, Wes Craven, etc.) as well as encore appearances from characters from previous Smith films. It starts out extremely funny, with some hilarious and on-point dialogue, then starts to go flat as the story takes over and Smith works to get the movie to a substantial feature length. (It might have worked even better as a short.) That said, there are a reasonable amount of laughs to be had, especially as Jay and Silent Bob react to other individuals, or others react to them. Smiths' dialogue is amusingly profane, then begins falling back on the vulgarities a bit much, before calming down again.There are some funny vignettes, particularly when Jay and Silent Bob are convinced to liberate an orang-utan (people keep referring to it as a "monkey") from an experimental lab, and the cute ape becomes a constant companion. The simian actor playing the role is quite endearing.Some of the brightest moments involve either the process of acting and filmmaking, or the breaking of the fourth wall. Characters don't necessarily *address* the audience, but they *do* acknowledge them.Mewes is likeable, but Smith is generally funnier in this viewers' opinion due to never speaking unless he absolutely has to. Smiths' pantomime can be a real hoot. Shannon Elizabeth is adorable as the traveller who becomes the apple of Jays' eye. Eliza Dushku, Ali Larter, and Jennifer Schwalbach Smith (the directors' wife) are sexy and sultry fun as Elizabeths' conniving associates.Overall, "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is fun stuff, especially for Smith devotees, finishing with a vibrant musical performance by Morris Day and The Time.Seven out of 10.

Whether or not you enjoy `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is going to depend a lot on whether or not you enjoy director Kevin Smith. I, for one, think the guy is a genius.  If you don't mind my lauding his name, read on. First, a little background for the uninitiated.Kevin Smith's movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and now JSBSB) are a world created by the director himself, in the sense that all are interconnected by characters, plot points, and subtle references. The one constant, though, is the entity known as Jay and Silent Bob, a pair of pot dealers who have more or less spent their entire lives standing in front of the Quik-Stop convenience store.  Jay (Jason Mewes) is the long-haired guy we all knew in high school, his endless stream of four-letter epithets almost endearing because the goofy guy just doesn't know any better.  Silent Bob (played by director Kevin Smith), Jay's self-described `hetero life-mate' stands by without speaking a word and provides some sort of moral counterpoint for the duo. In Smith's `Chasing Amy,' Banky and Holden (Jason Lee and Ben Affleck, respectively) created a comic book entitled `Bluntman and Chronic,' based on their real-life buddies Jay and Silent Bob.  Fast-forward to `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.'Banky has sold the rights to his comic to Miramax pictures, leaving Jay and Silent Bob in the dark about the business deal.  Jay and Bob, with help from Holden, discover via the Internet (`What's the Internet?' asks Jay) that a movie based on them is about to start production. Realizing that they won't see a dime of the money, and even more upset by their defamation on Internet message boards, they decide to truck across the country to stop the film from being produced.It's important to note that while the comedy is crude, slapstick, and even resorts to fart jokes, it's not dumb comedy, it's satire at it's finest, reminiscent of such self-deprecating masterpieces as `Pee-Wee's Big Adventure' and `Blazing Saddles.' After the fairly serious `Chasing Amy' and the spiritually overtoned `Dogma,' we see that Smith has decided to get together with his buddies and put together one big inside joke. Fortunately, he's decided to let a few of us in on it.  The viewer's enjoyment of the movie is going to depend completely on his or her knowledge of Smith's previous films and characters. Smith's friends show up in cameos, from Chris Rock to Will Ferrell to Alanis Morrissette to Carrie Fisher to Mark Hamill (Smith is an infamous Star Wars fanatic). You can literally see a man's childhood dream coming true when at one point, Smith's Bob gets to carry on a lightsaber duel with Hamill.Local interest: In one of the many subplots, a group of female jewel thieves bring Jay and Silent Bob to our very own Boulder, Colorado, to steal a monkey from a medical testing facility. `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is a comedy, and doesn't try to be anything else.  The only thing I felt was missing was one of Jason Lee's  inspired monologues bitterly bemoaning the state of society.  Some of Shannon Elizabeth's screen time could have been cut, I felt, in favor of some trademark Smith dialogue.Smith now intends to focus his time on more dramatic pursuits, and we are given this as the fifth and last film in his so-called `Jersey Trilogy.' The bottom line is, Smith loves his fans, and this film was created for the loyal.  A fitting send-off for Jay and Silent Bob, this film gets an `A-.'

The comic "Bluntman and Chronic" is based on real-life stoners Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), so when they get no profit from a big-screen adaptation they set out to wreck the movie.Being a huge fan of Kevin Smith back in the day (seeing each film on day one in the theater, starting with "Mallrats"), this film holds a special place in my heart. Now, objectively, it is not particularly that great of a film, relying heavily on potty humor and celebrity cameos. But it has a self-referential style that has to be appreciated.The first three films remain the strongest, and I think "Dogma" was a step down (a view that few people agree with). I blame this on the characters being more mobile -- the style switched from being conversation and dialogue-based to being much more active. This film is also quite active, but that almost seems like part of the joke -- it is, after all, something of a road movie.The jokes with Brodie, Dante and others were a bit too easy... but Ben Affleck joking about himself makes it all worth it. (I am especially a fan of the "Phantoms" joke, which was itself a reference to another joke from the "Mallrats" commentary... very obscure!)

A fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. It has a really impressive all-star cast and I also love the way it celebrates the previous films by Kevin Smith.

''f*ck,f*ck,f*ck'' when these words are said by a two year old version of Jay before the film switches to present day Jay doing his rap(''drinkin beers beers beers,rollin fatties,etc)the tone of the film is firmly set.But did you expect anything else?The heroes of Kevin Smiths Jersey film series finally get the screen time,and sadly the send off,they deserve.This film is JOKES from start to finish,the dialogue is funny and in places very rude, especially from Jay.|The cast is full of brilliantly chosen cameos,featuring many people having a tongue in cheek pop at themselves.The Good Will Hunting 2:Hunting season section shows Ben affleck and Matt Damon can laugh at themselves,which in a film like this they would need to!Jason Mewes is on top form as is Kevin Smith,especially when Bob is finally driven to an uncharacteristic outburst of more than a few words.BOUT TIME!!!The continuity of this in relation to the previous Jay and Silent Bob outings is superb,and although it is a funnier film if you have seen Kevin Smiths other Jersey films,there are still plenty of jokes for the uninitiated.This is mostly down to a fantastic supporting cast of some great comedic performers.Will Ferrells WildLife Marshall is funny as f*ck as Jay would say!The movie is not just full of jokes at previous Jersey films expense,but it takes a few good shots at other films and even the film industry itself...could Movie Poopshoot.com be a reference to IMDb.com?who knows?.The 2 disc DVD is WELL worth getting if you like the movie,the outtakes are worth the money alone.And one particular extra ''Ham Affleck'' is worth checking,with Ben showing his real cheese skills(which he would perfected in Pearl Harbour,only that time he was trying to be serious).Also the introductions to the many deleted scenes are worth watching,with Affleck again taking some lighthearted ripping from Mewes and Smith.LOL.Rude,fun poking,loud and very very funny.....just like Jay.9/10

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a good movie with a well written plot and a top notch comedic cast. It's a complete joke from start to finish, parodying the film industry and even having Kevin Smith make fun of himself on several occasions. Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are stellar in the lead roles, with many other supporting roles and cameos throughout that shine. The likes of Will Ferrell, Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Carrie Fisher and Chris Rock make this movie all the while better by having starred in it. The movie does tend to drag on a bit, lingering on certain plot points and not moving forward as much as it could have. It should have been a lot more zanier and fast paced, more exciting. I also thought it could have stayed in line with its plot a little more. It had a really interesting set up here, and yet still managed to go completely off the radar on several occasions. I get that this is the appeal for these type of movies, but there were occasions were I wanted the plot to just move forward. It's a very fun ride from start to finish. Stellar cameos throughout and simply hilarious, if you are a fan of the Jay & Silent Bob characters then it is definitely worth the watch, although it would not make much sense to someone outside of that universe. When Jay & Silent Bob find out they are not getting any profit from a big screen adaptation of them, they set out to wreck the movie. Best Performance: Will Ferrell

If you're the type of movie goer who gets uptight hearing countless F Bombs and explicit sexual discussion, then please move along and let others get in line to see one of the Funniest movies I have seen in my recent memory."Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is a movie that has so much going on, that one screening is not enough for me to all that was thrown at me in 90 plus minutes.Writer/Director/Co-Star, Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) has without a doubt created if not his best movie, then it would have to be his funniest.  A fitting conclusion to his "New Jersey Trilogy" (that now consists of five films instead of the originally planned three) forgoes the serious religious overtones of "Dogma" and the Sexuality issues brought forth in "Chasing Amy" to go for pure Laughs...............and it succeeds.The film's main plot revolves around the familiar duo of Jay (Jason Mewes) and his "Heterosexual Life mate" Silent Bob and their attempts to thwart a movie based on a comic book about Jay and Bob.  It's essentially a road picture as the guys make their way from Leonardo, New Jersey to Hollywood. Along the way they meet international Jewel Thieves, Steal a Monkey,  Meet The Scooby Doo gang,  Try and Beat up Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and much more.As Silly as all this sounds it's done in such a way that's smart, witty, and still has a touch of class about it.  And that's pretty hard to do considering I can't even tell you some of the content of the movie without being censored heavily.If you are at all familiar with Smith's movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma) you will get a kick out of the countless cameos and connections to his other films.  For Example, Jason Lee reprises two roles (one from "Mallrats" and one from "Chasing Amy") as does Ben Affleck.  Matt Damon appears as himself playing "Will Hunting" in a fictitious sequel to "Good Will Hunting" entitled `Good Will Hunting II: Hunting Season". There are two highlights of this movie that I need to talk about.  First Being Jason Mewes as "Jay".  This guy is for real, by far and away he has put in the best performance of all his five film appearances  as "Jay"  He carries the picture and is side splittingly funny.  It is my hope that he can now get other roles in movies besides the loveable Dope smoking "Jay". Secondly I want to address Kevin Smith's Directing.  To all the people who say Smith can't direct need to see "Jay and Silent Bob". His use of motion should silence everyone who claims there are no moving shots in a Smith film!!!  It's almost become fashionable to blast Smiths direction because that's the Thing to do. With all the great action and movement in "Jay and Silent Bob'  Smith can finally shrug off all the criticisms of the past.What can I say to sum up? It's a brilliant movie for everyone, not just Smith fans. You will laugh and laugh some more. Do yourself a favour and go see it as soon as you can!

I'm a big Kevin Smith fan but this movie is just not funny. It saddens me if people think this type of stuff passes off as comedy.We've really lowered our standards. For the ammount of talent this director/writer has to work with he can come up with a lot better -- I know I can. Nowadays it seems like if you have 2-3 funny scenes you can wrap a movie around it. What we have here is maybe two with a whole lot of riffing by Jay which to me has become pointess and boring since Mallrats. Maybe I'm just getting older but swearing, gay jokes and farting just kind of get old after 3-4 films, you know? At least the series is finally over and we'll see if Smith has any talent or not. Judging from this fluff I have extreme doubt.What ever happened to the clever sharp dialogue? That's all his film's had before. None of them (sans Chasing Amy) had any plot but were full of juicy monologues and one-liners, not to mention plenty of satire and on-target observations of our society. But that's been slowly receding and I think Kevin Smith fans have got to be brainwashed here now because this is NOT a good movie. I loved his first 3 movies and I know the universe of the characters and I found all the references to his other films, fans, critics, the interent to all be very lazy and poorly handled. I feel cheated by the one guy who I thought wouldn't sell out but he did it a long time ago...* (one star)Not worth your money...

Kevin Smith proved with J.S.B.S.B. that he is no longer just a glorified independent film maker.  In past films, Kevin Smith seemed to have a limited appeal, mostly among arm-chair directors (such as myself)who had become jaded with the Hollywood film industry, but with his slap-stick-like middle finger to the movie industry he seems to have branched out and struck a note with the "MTV audience" (10 to 16 year olds).  Smith's grade-school humor, delivered mostly by Jay, is nothing new to previous movies, but with  the focus on Jay & Silent Bob this humor became more evident AND more inviting to a younger audience.Nonetheless, Smith has not alienated his core audience who are, "...over and underweight guys who can't get laid." (See Holden McNeil in "Chasing Amy"). The simple visual affects, as in his past movies, are FAR  overshadowed by the fantastic dialogue he writes which has Hollywood stars chomping at the bit to deliver.  If anything, the only disappointment was a  very thin plot (OK, Mallrats: Had a plot, no one ever said it was a good one).  But as he did in Mallrats, for what J.S.B.S.B. is lacking in plot, Smith sure as hell made up for it in laughs.This movie junkie gives "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" a 9 out of 10.. .let's just hope what Chris Rock says in the movie doesn't come true.  See the movie and you'll get what I mean.

Jay and Silent Bob strike back is the story of best friends Jay and Silent Bob and anyone wishing to start with Kevin Smith's filmography should start with this film. It introduces the central character of the Universe and has cameos by almost everyone from other films. Plus a lot more, especially if you love Star Wars. The jokes are funny and the script flows very well. Cameos abound and some like Will Ferrell's ranger had me in stitches. Go see this film now.

This movie is not funny.  It is silly and stupid in the most boring sense. I sat in a movie theatre and heard no laughs, and watched a number of people leave midway. What has come over you who voted and gave it an 8?  I noticed that the vast majority of those voting are males 18-30.  Has our gender deteriorated so much that we consider this kind of drivel to be entertaining?

Stoners Jay and Bob spend their time selling drugs in front of a grocery store and hanging out.  When they are introduced to the world of the internet they discover that a film version is being made of the comic book that they were the inspiration for.  Not only that but people are on the message boards insulting and slandering them.  In order to stop the slander Jay and Bob decide to travel to Hollywood to stop the filming and therefore stop the internet discussions.  A cross-country adventure ensues that includes stolen monkeys, international jewel thieves, the scooby-doo gang, a star wars confrontation, many many cameos and a million rude jokes.The plot for this film is very, very weak.  However for the most part you're laughing so hard you don't care how thin it is.  It's only the middle section where the Scooby Doo bit and the jewel thief bit come in, where the jokes are less funny and the plot is more silly where you feel it.  That said it's still really funny - Jay's desire to steal/liberate a monkey in order to get a woman to sleep with him is hilarious ("we steal monkeys all the time in Jersey" "If I'd known stealing monkeys would get me sex, I'd have been doing it since I was 7!") as is his rant on behalf of C.L.I.T.!The humour is all of one type.  If you know these characters from the other Red Bank films then you'll know if you'll like them or not.  If you don't know them already then some of the jokes here will go over your head - there's lots of in-jokes and references to actions and characters in the other films that you won't understand (although some are still funny).  Some of the references go too far and aren't funny - one joke in particular where the characters say something like "who'd pay to see a movie like that?" or "I hate it when you get roped into a movie by a friend" and then look out at the audience, isn't funny the first time or the 5th time.  However most of the jokes are really funny thanks to a) Mewes's wonderfully un-PC, obscene dealer and b) Smith's great writing.As I said some of the scenes are funny for 5 seconds but soon die out (the scooby doo bit gets dry pretty quick) but the majority is great.  Standout bits include the monkey stuff, the whole Miramax-ribbing climax, the Phantom Menace skit and Chris Rock's angry black director (very similar to Hooper in Chasing Amy).  The focus on sex related jokes makes for a film you're either going like or hate - and I loved it.  Yes too many characters from other film are shoved in unfunny scenes (Affleck's Holden is poor and Lee is given nothing to work with in the role of Brodie that he was fantastic in in Mallrats), but the majority of it is great.There are too many cameos to mention but nearly all of them are funny - high points include Chris Rock who missed out on making a black Sesame Street (he was going to call it N.W.P. - you work it out!), Carrie Fisher as the nun who lives by the book, Jason Biggs lamenting his pie-humping typecasting, Mark Hamill in the star wars spoof, the director and cast of Good Will Hunting poking major fun at Miramax and money grabbing sequels and Wes Craven directing Shannon Doherty in Scream 4 in a bang-on swipe at the Scream movies.  The main acting pressure was all on Mewes as Jay, as Bob doesn't speak enough to carry the film, and he succeeds.  Here his dirty mouth is given plenty of funny situations and good lines to work with and it ensures that his good performance carries through the whole thing and stops him getting annoying.Overall this is one funny film and a very good way to say goodbye to these characters.  Dry is some places, brilliant in others this isn't to everyone's taste but will please Smith fans easily.  It's not The Godfather but it does what it's supposed to and does it well.

Still a funny and enjoyable but clerks was the better film. I still enjoyed this film but like most films that...have such an impact as clerks did its hard to make a follow up as good as the first

Best appreciated with Kevin Smith's early career movies fresh in memory, this fifth feature from the Jersey director gives his recurring supporting characters a film of their own as the two stoner friends set out to sabotage a Hollywood motion picture based on their likenesses. It is as fun as it sounds and while Jay and Silent Bob's shenanigans are not as funny here as in 'Mallrats' (where they stole every scene), Smith milks every movie-making reference for all that it is worth. There are some great fourth-wall breaking moments, Ben Affleck is hilarious as his 'Chasing Amy' character who scoffs at Affleck the actor, stating that he is "not a fan" of 'Good Will Hunting', and there is a wacky 'Scooby Doo' parody in the mix too. The most deliciously satirical moments are saved for the third act though with the title characters running amok in Miramax Studios where Wes Craven is shooting yet another 'Scream' flick and Gus Van Sant is filming a lame 'Good Will Hunting' sequel! Affleck and Matt Damon (playing themselves) are given some of the film's funniest dialogue in this section as they mock each other's career choices. While the film ends on a high note, there is no denying how sidetracked the middle section of the film feels as the duo become involved with animal rights activists. Smith overdoses on gags involving the acronym 'C.L.I.T.', Will Ferrell is grating as an inept cop, and most disappointingly, this middle section lacks the movie references of the film's first and final half hour. Never to mind, the highlights of the film are what stand out afterwards and there too many to count. All concerned are in top form and 'Star Wars' fans will no doubt appreciate Mark Hamill's cameo as a flabbergasted actor.

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001): Dir: Kevin Smith / Cast: Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Shannon Elizabeth, Will Ferrell, Eliza Dushku: A celebration of characters made memorable by Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes. The dope dealing duo discover a movie in production based on their personas so they venture to Hollywood to stop it. Amusing setup simmers into road movie formula where they molest a nun, steal an ape, and encounter four female thieves. Director Kevin Smith delivers Hollywood in jokes with celebrities spoofing themselves yet this still manages to be only a routine road movie crude comedy. Mewes and Smith are on target until the road trip then everything depends on celebrity cameos and a dreary subplot regarding the four female thieves. In the end they stand up for the little guy as well as gain acclaim in Hollywood for which they cause quite a fiasco. Shannon Elizabeth among the thieves is weak. None of these females are particularly well drawn but Elizabeth and her desires for Jay is too far fetched. Will Ferrell is hilarious as a ranger whom is constantly made the fool yet his determination seems to pull through. Eliza Dushku leads the female bandits that also include Ali Larter and Jennifer Schwalbach. Film ties together characters from previous Smith films with references to Hollywood but the humour is vulgar with a total lack of dignity in its heroes. Score: 7 ½ / 10

Writer/director/co-star Kevin Smith bids farewell to the Jay and Silent Bob characters in "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back," the first of the five movies featuring them in which they are the stars. He couldn't have come up with a better send-off for them. True, there's no big ideas behind this film like there were in "Dogma" or "Chasing Amy," but really, the grand ideas in those movies came from the main characters, not Jay and Silent Bob. They were there for comic relief mainly. Therefore, it makes sense that "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" would be pure slapstick comedy. Think about it, do you really want a foul-mouthed, over-sexed stoner telling you how to live your life?So anyway, it's a pure slapstick humor road movie. But unlike most slapstick comedies of late, this one's actually funny...extremely funny. Jay and Silent Bob find out that a movie is being made from a comic book (Bluntman & Chronic) that was based on them. They set off for Hollywood intending to stop it. Kevin Smith manages to pack so many jokes into what could have been another predictable, boring road comedy, that it's head and shoulders above the competition. I'm gonna have to go see it again, to make sure I didn't miss any jokes. Smith once again is showing off his incredible writing skills. Some people may not believe that any movie full of crude, R-rated humor is well written, but it is. Not only is it incredibly funny, but there's an intelligence and wit behind it that is unmistakably Kevin Smith's.I was also pleased with the quality of acting in the movie, especially Jason Mewes (Jay). In past View Askew movies, Mewes has been funny, despite not doing a particularly good job of acting. The one thing I was worried about was whether or not he'd be able to carry a film mostly by himself (since Silent Bob is mostly, well, silent). But he definitely proved that he has grown enough as an actor to be able to head up a movie. Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) does his usual decent job. Since he doesn't say much, mainly just reacts, he can't to a great job, but he's still very funny. He's the perfect companion (or should I say, "hetero life mate" for Jay, who's the complete opposite. There are no real other big parts in the movie, but there are tons of little cameos. Really, I think it'd be easier to list the people who DON'T appear in it. Some of the highlights include a scene with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon playing themselves, on the set of "Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season," a scene with Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek, as themselves, playing the stars of the Bluntman and Chronic movie, and a scene with Mark Hamill parodying Star Wars. But really, almost all of the jokes are highlights.For people who have seen the other films in Smith's New Jersey Chronicles series ("Clerks," "Mallrats," "Chasing Amy," & "Dogma"), there are quite a few in-jokes that you will find hilarious. In addition to playing himself, Affleck also reprises his role as Holden from "Chasing Amy," Jason Lee reprises his roles from "Chasing Amy" and "Mallrats," and Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran reprise their "Clerks" roles. Many others from the View Askewniverse appear as well. However, this movie is not only for fanboys. I saw it with a friend who hadn't seen any of the other four movies, and he thought it was hilarious too. The majority of the jokes will be understood by anyone. The in-jokes are like a little bonus from Smith to his fans, but they are not the focus of the movie.Kevin Smith also does a good job directing. Lately, it seems to have become popular to attack Smith's directing ability, but I think he did a good job. In his earlier movies, his directing was simply decent, not good, not bad. But he has made a lot of progress. This is one of the better directed comedies I've seen. Not Academy Award stuff, but most other comedy directors are pretty boring it seems.I want to briefly comment on the GLAAD protests of the film, citing large amounts of homophobia. I am gay, and I didn't find the film offensive. I think a lot of people are just taking the film way to seriously. It's not a serious film. People forget that Jay is, basically, a moron, so you can exactly take everything he says as the truth. Smith has said it's supposed to be a satire, and it works. Especially considering that in past films, Jay has admitted to sometimes fantasizing about guys. It's a satire, lighten up people. There's actually a funny scene where James Van Der Beek chastises Jason Biggs for calling something "gay," and also there's a funny disclaimer at the end.Which reminds me, stay for the credits. There's plenty of funny stuff, and Alanis Morissette shows up at the very end. All in all, "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is an extremely funny movie, plain and simple. Just don't take it seriously, because again, it's not a serious movie. There's still a few months to go, but I think this will prove to be the funniest movie of the year...actually, of the last many years. Quit reading this and go see it!Rating: 10/10

Jay and Silent Bob decide to go to Hollywood to avoid the shooting of a film about their alter ego, 'Bluntman and Chronic'. I am a great fan of Kevin Smith, however, this movie is not in the same level of 'Clerks', 'Mall Rats', 'Chasing Amy' and 'Dogma'. Maybe it is his most expensive movie, but he exceeds in fart jokes and other vulgarities. But there are also funny references to movies ('Star Wars', 'Good Will Hunting', Charlie's Angels'), actors (Ben Affleck, Matt Damon), studio ('Miramax'). The joke with Mark Hamill is great. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Império (do Besteirol) Contra-Ataca" ("The Empire (of the Bullshit) Counter-Attacks")

Let me start out by saying that like most people here, I am a Kevin Smith fan.  I thought clerks and chasing amy were great movies from a brilliant director.  Superb acting, great jokes, and great characters.Unfortunately, his newest movie, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, has none of those things.  First of all, let me point out that these characters are not the same Jay and Silent Bob many of you will remember from Clerks.  They were annoying, drug-dealing losers who played a small role in the movie. Somewhere along the way, however, they became lovable goons that are the center of a movie.  I'm not sure these characters are well developed enough to be the main characters.Anyways, on to the movie.  This movie starts out SLLLOOOOWWWWW...It was too bad that they bring back lots of great characters like Randall, Dante, and Brody, but only for quick cameo shots.  None of them offer anything to this movie.  It takes a while, but finally the jokes start rolling.  Sadly, Kevin Smith kind of gave in to the "American Pie" movie style, which is just making lewd comments and sexual jokes.  There is no intelligent, insightful dialogue, as you are used to from his other movies.I think that the one bright spot of the movie was Chris Rock's character. He displays the charm and wittiness that you have come to know from characters like Banky, Randall, Hooper X, etc.Overall, i would give this movie 4 stars out of 10.  There are some funny spots, but they do not really start until about halfway through the movie.

When I was first asked by a friend to watch this DVD with her my initial reaction was that it's not for me. Stoner humour is not my normal genre, cheech and chong bored me, as did many other films based around the same sort of thing. When she told me that it was the two goof balls out of Dogma I was even more concerned that I was about to give two hours of my life to trash.What a change! Kevin Smith has worked a wonder on this film, the quick (if a little predictable) one liners, the skill of the cast, alongside the non stop comedy coming from cameos, often playing parodies of themselves makes it worth buying a copy. The only thing that lets the movie down is it's "art school" look; in places it can look like Smith happens to have some high powered friends that helped to promote this movie and make it the success it was. If you want a light hearted film to watch over and over again, picking up the more subtle gags then it's one for you.Hope this helps. PG

Kevin Smith has done something not too many filmmakers are able to accomplish.  He has directed 5 films in a row, that have been in my mind all funny, often though provoking and just really good movies.  This is the fifth movie, the last of his New Jersey series with his always present Jay and Silent Bob, is not the best of his series but it is still possibly the funniest film I have seen this summer.  A consistently silly yet laugh out loud fest of jokes and usual one liners from Smith that scores well, even if it doesn't score as well as Dogma or Clerks.Here, the dynamic stoner duo find out through a weird new invention known as the internet (a place to bitch about movies and swap pornography) that a movie is being made about them, er, they're comic book alter egos from Chasing Amy known as Bluntman and Chronic.  They get so steamed they head for Miramax studios in Hollywood to stop the movie.  This starts the odyssey that brings up cameos including George Carlin (sick, but still funny), Carrie Fisher, Mark Hammil, and basically most of the stars from the past Smith movies.  This film is like a big inside joke, and if you get it, you'll like it more than others I guess.  But it is still funny for anyone who wants a good laugh and is tired of some of the really lame comedies of late.  It's a nice, if sometimes a little obscene (not in a bad way), gem.  One more note, not only does the movie bring mack many of the past stars of the view askew movies, but it also answers a question: what happened to Jay and Silent Bob after the end of Mallrats.  Kudos to Smith and the whole cast. A

This one is for complete morons who are proud of their status. I LOL'd only two times. This film was an "in-your-face-we-don't-care-about-you-and-you're-too-dumb-to-realize-it." There was an atmosphere of high school elitism: "We don't care about anyone but ourselves because we think we're funny and we're great." It was so egocentric and totally lazy. I saw little creativity and many stupid, stupid jokes. However, Ben and Matt should be commended for their ability to laugh at themselves. They and James VDB were funny. As for the film as a whole, it was a crashing bore for retards and geeks. One of the few films I have ever seen that truly fits the "AWFUL" category. Note that in the word awful are the two letters of F and U. Rated it 1.

For the record, I have not seen Kevin Smith's previous works, Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, or Dogma, which, I'm almost positive, affected how I saw the movie, since Smith puts in so many in-jokes and references to his previous movies, I didn't get them, except for the blatantly obvious ones.Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) hang out in front of a convience store selling weed. When the get a restraining order, they find out that the comic starring their likenesses Bluntman and Chronic is being turned into a Miramax movie. However, they aren't being paid for it, so what to do? Travel cross-country to Hollywood from New Jersey to stop the movie from getting made, what else?Crude, inappropriate, and extremely funny. If there's ever a movie that you should watch with your drinking friends and not with a date or family, this is the one! It has jokes about genetalia, bodily functions, innuendoes, and more, and I haven't laughed this hard at a movie for a long time. Call me immature, but I like this type of stuff, ones that actually have substance behind the crude jokes (not like Old School).Mewes was f-ing hilarious, when he f-ing say the f-ing f-word every f-ing word. It has over 230 f-words along in this movie, with the total number of curses probably around 300. I have never heard so many, but I laughed. I'm not ashamed to admit it: Mewes cracked me up, with his stylish arrogance and foul mouth. Smith, who was laconic for almost the entire film, expressed everything with his eyes, which were funny. There were more cameos than a movie of The Simpsons, with Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, George Carlin, Jamie Kennedy, Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, Joey Lauren Adams, and many, many more.There were many pot-shots of American movies. For instance, when Jay and Silent Bob meet a drug dealer played by Tracy Morgan, he says that Miramax accounts for about 75% of his income. Also, everyone on-screen looks at the camera when they mention, `No one would pay to see a Jay and Silent Bob movie,' and when Ben Affleck says that one reason you do a picture is because you owe a friend a favor. As the Bluntman and Chronic movies premieres, someone says, `Well, it was better than Mallrats.'Are you easily offended? Does the mention of various body parts upset you? If you answered yes to either question, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is not your movie. If you answered no, sit back and enjoy the ride!My rating: 7/10Rated R for nonstop crude and sexual humor, pervasive strong language, and drug content.

Kevin Smith's previous movies always seemed to be something of a mixed bag. Whether ambitious thematically, ("Dogma", "Chasing Amy"), or outright comedy, ("Mallrats"), the movies as a whole were less satisfactory than their many very funny parts. The sporadic appearances of the second string character duo of Jay and Silent Bob were always a welcome event.The big question was whether this 2001 styled Laurel and Hardy, when promoted to center stage, could carry a movie. The answer much to my surprise was a resounding yes. Smith outdoes himself, producing an exceptional comedy. It's consistently inventive, with surprises, in jokes and many cameos from Smith regulars, all who seem to be genuinely having a ball. Never has irreverence and bad language been done with so much charm.Those who disliked Smith's previous works would do well to stay away, they are unlikely to be converted. But for fans, Smith really does deliver the goods, in a big way.I was totally baffled by reading that certain gay groups took offence to this movie. It would seem to me a total misreading as well as a great deficiency in the humor department. Apart from the fact that Smith lampoons all and sundry, it actually struck me as a particularly gay friendly movie. The fact that a gay character sums the movie up as one big gay joke should be taken as a compliment more than anything else.It's clear that this brings Smith's cycle to a close. He couldn't have wished for a better ending.

Writer / editor / director / co-star Kevin Smith gave his infamous title slacker characters this big feature vehicle, in which Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself) learn that a big screen adaptation of "Bluntman and Chronic" is happening. Since these comic book characters were based on Jay and Silent Bob, they realize that they SHOULD get a piece of the pie. They then set off on a cross-country odyssey from Jersey to Hollywood, to either get their share of the dough, or else stop the movie from being made.I will grant that this whole thing does play like one giant in-joke, with an impressive roster of cameo appearances (Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, George Carlin, Wes Craven, etc.) as well as encore appearances from characters from previous Smith films. It starts out extremely funny, with some hilarious and on-point dialogue, then starts to go flat as the story takes over and Smith works to get the movie to a substantial feature length. (It might have worked even better as a short.) That said, there are a reasonable amount of laughs to be had, especially as Jay and Silent Bob react to other individuals, or others react to them. Smiths' dialogue is amusingly profane, then begins falling back on the vulgarities a bit much, before calming down again.There are some funny vignettes, particularly when Jay and Silent Bob are convinced to liberate an orang-utan (people keep referring to it as a "monkey") from an experimental lab, and the cute ape becomes a constant companion. The simian actor playing the role is quite endearing.Some of the brightest moments involve either the process of acting and filmmaking, or the breaking of the fourth wall. Characters don't necessarily *address* the audience, but they *do* acknowledge them.Mewes is likeable, but Smith is generally funnier in this viewers' opinion due to never speaking unless he absolutely has to. Smiths' pantomime can be a real hoot. Shannon Elizabeth is adorable as the traveller who becomes the apple of Jays' eye. Eliza Dushku, Ali Larter, and Jennifer Schwalbach Smith (the directors' wife) are sexy and sultry fun as Elizabeths' conniving associates.Overall, "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is fun stuff, especially for Smith devotees, finishing with a vibrant musical performance by Morris Day and The Time.Seven out of 10.

Whether or not you enjoy `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is going to depend a lot on whether or not you enjoy director Kevin Smith. I, for one, think the guy is a genius.  If you don't mind my lauding his name, read on. First, a little background for the uninitiated.Kevin Smith's movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and now JSBSB) are a world created by the director himself, in the sense that all are interconnected by characters, plot points, and subtle references. The one constant, though, is the entity known as Jay and Silent Bob, a pair of pot dealers who have more or less spent their entire lives standing in front of the Quik-Stop convenience store.  Jay (Jason Mewes) is the long-haired guy we all knew in high school, his endless stream of four-letter epithets almost endearing because the goofy guy just doesn't know any better.  Silent Bob (played by director Kevin Smith), Jay's self-described `hetero life-mate' stands by without speaking a word and provides some sort of moral counterpoint for the duo. In Smith's `Chasing Amy,' Banky and Holden (Jason Lee and Ben Affleck, respectively) created a comic book entitled `Bluntman and Chronic,' based on their real-life buddies Jay and Silent Bob.  Fast-forward to `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.'Banky has sold the rights to his comic to Miramax pictures, leaving Jay and Silent Bob in the dark about the business deal.  Jay and Bob, with help from Holden, discover via the Internet (`What's the Internet?' asks Jay) that a movie based on them is about to start production. Realizing that they won't see a dime of the money, and even more upset by their defamation on Internet message boards, they decide to truck across the country to stop the film from being produced.It's important to note that while the comedy is crude, slapstick, and even resorts to fart jokes, it's not dumb comedy, it's satire at it's finest, reminiscent of such self-deprecating masterpieces as `Pee-Wee's Big Adventure' and `Blazing Saddles.' After the fairly serious `Chasing Amy' and the spiritually overtoned `Dogma,' we see that Smith has decided to get together with his buddies and put together one big inside joke. Fortunately, he's decided to let a few of us in on it.  The viewer's enjoyment of the movie is going to depend completely on his or her knowledge of Smith's previous films and characters. Smith's friends show up in cameos, from Chris Rock to Will Ferrell to Alanis Morrissette to Carrie Fisher to Mark Hamill (Smith is an infamous Star Wars fanatic). You can literally see a man's childhood dream coming true when at one point, Smith's Bob gets to carry on a lightsaber duel with Hamill.Local interest: In one of the many subplots, a group of female jewel thieves bring Jay and Silent Bob to our very own Boulder, Colorado, to steal a monkey from a medical testing facility. `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is a comedy, and doesn't try to be anything else.  The only thing I felt was missing was one of Jason Lee's  inspired monologues bitterly bemoaning the state of society.  Some of Shannon Elizabeth's screen time could have been cut, I felt, in favor of some trademark Smith dialogue.Smith now intends to focus his time on more dramatic pursuits, and we are given this as the fifth and last film in his so-called `Jersey Trilogy.' The bottom line is, Smith loves his fans, and this film was created for the loyal.  A fitting send-off for Jay and Silent Bob, this film gets an `A-.'

The comic "Bluntman and Chronic" is based on real-life stoners Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), so when they get no profit from a big-screen adaptation they set out to wreck the movie.Being a huge fan of Kevin Smith back in the day (seeing each film on day one in the theater, starting with "Mallrats"), this film holds a special place in my heart. Now, objectively, it is not particularly that great of a film, relying heavily on potty humor and celebrity cameos. But it has a self-referential style that has to be appreciated.The first three films remain the strongest, and I think "Dogma" was a step down (a view that few people agree with). I blame this on the characters being more mobile -- the style switched from being conversation and dialogue-based to being much more active. This film is also quite active, but that almost seems like part of the joke -- it is, after all, something of a road movie.The jokes with Brodie, Dante and others were a bit too easy... but Ben Affleck joking about himself makes it all worth it. (I am especially a fan of the "Phantoms" joke, which was itself a reference to another joke from the "Mallrats" commentary... very obscure!)

Best appreciated with Kevin Smith's early career movies fresh in memory, this fifth feature from the Jersey director gives his recurring supporting characters a film of their own as the two stoner friends set out to sabotage a Hollywood motion picture based on their likenesses. It is as fun as it sounds and while Jay and Silent Bob's shenanigans are not as funny here as in 'Mallrats' (where they stole every scene), Smith milks every movie-making reference for all that it is worth. There are some great fourth-wall breaking moments, Ben Affleck is hilarious as his 'Chasing Amy' character who scoffs at Affleck the actor, stating that he is "not a fan" of 'Good Will Hunting', and there is a wacky 'Scooby Doo' parody in the mix too. The most deliciously satirical moments are saved for the third act though with the title characters running amok in Miramax Studios where Wes Craven is shooting yet another 'Scream' flick and Gus Van Sant is filming a lame 'Good Will Hunting' sequel! Affleck and Matt Damon (playing themselves) are given some of the film's funniest dialogue in this section as they mock each other's career choices. While the film ends on a high note, there is no denying how sidetracked the middle section of the film feels as the duo become involved with animal rights activists. Smith overdoses on gags involving the acronym 'C.L.I.T.', Will Ferrell is grating as an inept cop, and most disappointingly, this middle section lacks the movie references of the film's first and final half hour. Never to mind, the highlights of the film are what stand out afterwards and there too many to count. All concerned are in top form and 'Star Wars' fans will no doubt appreciate Mark Hamill's cameo as a flabbergasted actor.

''f*ck,f*ck,f*ck'' when these words are said by a two year old version of Jay before the film switches to present day Jay doing his rap(''drinkin beers beers beers,rollin fatties,etc)the tone of the film is firmly set.But did you expect anything else?The heroes of Kevin Smiths Jersey film series finally get the screen time,and sadly the send off,they deserve.This film is JOKES from start to finish,the dialogue is funny and in places very rude, especially from Jay.|The cast is full of brilliantly chosen cameos,featuring many people having a tongue in cheek pop at themselves.The Good Will Hunting 2:Hunting season section shows Ben affleck and Matt Damon can laugh at themselves,which in a film like this they would need to!Jason Mewes is on top form as is Kevin Smith,especially when Bob is finally driven to an uncharacteristic outburst of more than a few words.BOUT TIME!!!The continuity of this in relation to the previous Jay and Silent Bob outings is superb,and although it is a funnier film if you have seen Kevin Smiths other Jersey films,there are still plenty of jokes for the uninitiated.This is mostly down to a fantastic supporting cast of some great comedic performers.Will Ferrells WildLife Marshall is funny as f*ck as Jay would say!The movie is not just full of jokes at previous Jersey films expense,but it takes a few good shots at other films and even the film industry itself...could Movie Poopshoot.com be a reference to IMDb.com?who knows?.The 2 disc DVD is WELL worth getting if you like the movie,the outtakes are worth the money alone.And one particular extra ''Ham Affleck'' is worth checking,with Ben showing his real cheese skills(which he would perfected in Pearl Harbour,only that time he was trying to be serious).Also the introductions to the many deleted scenes are worth watching,with Affleck again taking some lighthearted ripping from Mewes and Smith.LOL.Rude,fun poking,loud and very very funny.....just like Jay.9/10

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a good movie with a well written plot and a top notch comedic cast. It's a complete joke from start to finish, parodying the film industry and even having Kevin Smith make fun of himself on several occasions. Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are stellar in the lead roles, with many other supporting roles and cameos throughout that shine. The likes of Will Ferrell, Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Carrie Fisher and Chris Rock make this movie all the while better by having starred in it. The movie does tend to drag on a bit, lingering on certain plot points and not moving forward as much as it could have. It should have been a lot more zanier and fast paced, more exciting. I also thought it could have stayed in line with its plot a little more. It had a really interesting set up here, and yet still managed to go completely off the radar on several occasions. I get that this is the appeal for these type of movies, but there were occasions were I wanted the plot to just move forward. It's a very fun ride from start to finish. Stellar cameos throughout and simply hilarious, if you are a fan of the Jay & Silent Bob characters then it is definitely worth the watch, although it would not make much sense to someone outside of that universe. When Jay & Silent Bob find out they are not getting any profit from a big screen adaptation of them, they set out to wreck the movie. Best Performance: Will Ferrell

If you're the type of movie goer who gets uptight hearing countless F Bombs and explicit sexual discussion, then please move along and let others get in line to see one of the Funniest movies I have seen in my recent memory."Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is a movie that has so much going on, that one screening is not enough for me to all that was thrown at me in 90 plus minutes.Writer/Director/Co-Star, Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) has without a doubt created if not his best movie, then it would have to be his funniest.  A fitting conclusion to his "New Jersey Trilogy" (that now consists of five films instead of the originally planned three) forgoes the serious religious overtones of "Dogma" and the Sexuality issues brought forth in "Chasing Amy" to go for pure Laughs...............and it succeeds.The film's main plot revolves around the familiar duo of Jay (Jason Mewes) and his "Heterosexual Life mate" Silent Bob and their attempts to thwart a movie based on a comic book about Jay and Bob.  It's essentially a road picture as the guys make their way from Leonardo, New Jersey to Hollywood. Along the way they meet international Jewel Thieves, Steal a Monkey,  Meet The Scooby Doo gang,  Try and Beat up Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and much more.As Silly as all this sounds it's done in such a way that's smart, witty, and still has a touch of class about it.  And that's pretty hard to do considering I can't even tell you some of the content of the movie without being censored heavily.If you are at all familiar with Smith's movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma) you will get a kick out of the countless cameos and connections to his other films.  For Example, Jason Lee reprises two roles (one from "Mallrats" and one from "Chasing Amy") as does Ben Affleck.  Matt Damon appears as himself playing "Will Hunting" in a fictitious sequel to "Good Will Hunting" entitled `Good Will Hunting II: Hunting Season". There are two highlights of this movie that I need to talk about.  First Being Jason Mewes as "Jay".  This guy is for real, by far and away he has put in the best performance of all his five film appearances  as "Jay"  He carries the picture and is side splittingly funny.  It is my hope that he can now get other roles in movies besides the loveable Dope smoking "Jay". Secondly I want to address Kevin Smith's Directing.  To all the people who say Smith can't direct need to see "Jay and Silent Bob". His use of motion should silence everyone who claims there are no moving shots in a Smith film!!!  It's almost become fashionable to blast Smiths direction because that's the Thing to do. With all the great action and movement in "Jay and Silent Bob'  Smith can finally shrug off all the criticisms of the past.What can I say to sum up? It's a brilliant movie for everyone, not just Smith fans. You will laugh and laugh some more. Do yourself a favour and go see it as soon as you can!

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001): Dir: Kevin Smith / Cast: Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Shannon Elizabeth, Will Ferrell, Eliza Dushku: A celebration of characters made memorable by Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes. The dope dealing duo discover a movie in production based on their personas so they venture to Hollywood to stop it. Amusing setup simmers into road movie formula where they molest a nun, steal an ape, and encounter four female thieves. Director Kevin Smith delivers Hollywood in jokes with celebrities spoofing themselves yet this still manages to be only a routine road movie crude comedy. Mewes and Smith are on target until the road trip then everything depends on celebrity cameos and a dreary subplot regarding the four female thieves. In the end they stand up for the little guy as well as gain acclaim in Hollywood for which they cause quite a fiasco. Shannon Elizabeth among the thieves is weak. None of these females are particularly well drawn but Elizabeth and her desires for Jay is too far fetched. Will Ferrell is hilarious as a ranger whom is constantly made the fool yet his determination seems to pull through. Eliza Dushku leads the female bandits that also include Ali Larter and Jennifer Schwalbach. Film ties together characters from previous Smith films with references to Hollywood but the humour is vulgar with a total lack of dignity in its heroes. Score: 7 ½ / 10

I'm a big Kevin Smith fan but this movie is just not funny. It saddens me if people think this type of stuff passes off as comedy.We've really lowered our standards. For the ammount of talent this director/writer has to work with he can come up with a lot better -- I know I can. Nowadays it seems like if you have 2-3 funny scenes you can wrap a movie around it. What we have here is maybe two with a whole lot of riffing by Jay which to me has become pointess and boring since Mallrats. Maybe I'm just getting older but swearing, gay jokes and farting just kind of get old after 3-4 films, you know? At least the series is finally over and we'll see if Smith has any talent or not. Judging from this fluff I have extreme doubt.What ever happened to the clever sharp dialogue? That's all his film's had before. None of them (sans Chasing Amy) had any plot but were full of juicy monologues and one-liners, not to mention plenty of satire and on-target observations of our society. But that's been slowly receding and I think Kevin Smith fans have got to be brainwashed here now because this is NOT a good movie. I loved his first 3 movies and I know the universe of the characters and I found all the references to his other films, fans, critics, the interent to all be very lazy and poorly handled. I feel cheated by the one guy who I thought wouldn't sell out but he did it a long time ago...* (one star)Not worth your money...

Kevin Smith proved with J.S.B.S.B. that he is no longer just a glorified independent film maker.  In past films, Kevin Smith seemed to have a limited appeal, mostly among arm-chair directors (such as myself)who had become jaded with the Hollywood film industry, but with his slap-stick-like middle finger to the movie industry he seems to have branched out and struck a note with the "MTV audience" (10 to 16 year olds).  Smith's grade-school humor, delivered mostly by Jay, is nothing new to previous movies, but with  the focus on Jay & Silent Bob this humor became more evident AND more inviting to a younger audience.Nonetheless, Smith has not alienated his core audience who are, "...over and underweight guys who can't get laid." (See Holden McNeil in "Chasing Amy"). The simple visual affects, as in his past movies, are FAR  overshadowed by the fantastic dialogue he writes which has Hollywood stars chomping at the bit to deliver.  If anything, the only disappointment was a  very thin plot (OK, Mallrats: Had a plot, no one ever said it was a good one).  But as he did in Mallrats, for what J.S.B.S.B. is lacking in plot, Smith sure as hell made up for it in laughs.This movie junkie gives "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" a 9 out of 10.. .let's just hope what Chris Rock says in the movie doesn't come true.  See the movie and you'll get what I mean.

Still a funny and enjoyable but clerks was the better film. I still enjoyed this film but like most films that...have such an impact as clerks did its hard to make a follow up as good as the first

This movie is not funny.  It is silly and stupid in the most boring sense. I sat in a movie theatre and heard no laughs, and watched a number of people leave midway. What has come over you who voted and gave it an 8?  I noticed that the vast majority of those voting are males 18-30.  Has our gender deteriorated so much that we consider this kind of drivel to be entertaining?

Stoners Jay and Bob spend their time selling drugs in front of a grocery store and hanging out.  When they are introduced to the world of the internet they discover that a film version is being made of the comic book that they were the inspiration for.  Not only that but people are on the message boards insulting and slandering them.  In order to stop the slander Jay and Bob decide to travel to Hollywood to stop the filming and therefore stop the internet discussions.  A cross-country adventure ensues that includes stolen monkeys, international jewel thieves, the scooby-doo gang, a star wars confrontation, many many cameos and a million rude jokes.The plot for this film is very, very weak.  However for the most part you're laughing so hard you don't care how thin it is.  It's only the middle section where the Scooby Doo bit and the jewel thief bit come in, where the jokes are less funny and the plot is more silly where you feel it.  That said it's still really funny - Jay's desire to steal/liberate a monkey in order to get a woman to sleep with him is hilarious ("we steal monkeys all the time in Jersey" "If I'd known stealing monkeys would get me sex, I'd have been doing it since I was 7!") as is his rant on behalf of C.L.I.T.!The humour is all of one type.  If you know these characters from the other Red Bank films then you'll know if you'll like them or not.  If you don't know them already then some of the jokes here will go over your head - there's lots of in-jokes and references to actions and characters in the other films that you won't understand (although some are still funny).  Some of the references go too far and aren't funny - one joke in particular where the characters say something like "who'd pay to see a movie like that?" or "I hate it when you get roped into a movie by a friend" and then look out at the audience, isn't funny the first time or the 5th time.  However most of the jokes are really funny thanks to a) Mewes's wonderfully un-PC, obscene dealer and b) Smith's great writing.As I said some of the scenes are funny for 5 seconds but soon die out (the scooby doo bit gets dry pretty quick) but the majority is great.  Standout bits include the monkey stuff, the whole Miramax-ribbing climax, the Phantom Menace skit and Chris Rock's angry black director (very similar to Hooper in Chasing Amy).  The focus on sex related jokes makes for a film you're either going like or hate - and I loved it.  Yes too many characters from other film are shoved in unfunny scenes (Affleck's Holden is poor and Lee is given nothing to work with in the role of Brodie that he was fantastic in in Mallrats), but the majority of it is great.There are too many cameos to mention but nearly all of them are funny - high points include Chris Rock who missed out on making a black Sesame Street (he was going to call it N.W.P. - you work it out!), Carrie Fisher as the nun who lives by the book, Jason Biggs lamenting his pie-humping typecasting, Mark Hamill in the star wars spoof, the director and cast of Good Will Hunting poking major fun at Miramax and money grabbing sequels and Wes Craven directing Shannon Doherty in Scream 4 in a bang-on swipe at the Scream movies.  The main acting pressure was all on Mewes as Jay, as Bob doesn't speak enough to carry the film, and he succeeds.  Here his dirty mouth is given plenty of funny situations and good lines to work with and it ensures that his good performance carries through the whole thing and stops him getting annoying.Overall this is one funny film and a very good way to say goodbye to these characters.  Dry is some places, brilliant in others this isn't to everyone's taste but will please Smith fans easily.  It's not The Godfather but it does what it's supposed to and does it well.

I've long held the belief that a little Jason Mewes goes a long way, which makes a starring role an absolute roll of the dice. But there's plenty of name cameos and View Askiewniverse goings-on to keep things animated. Not all of the gags land, but the light sense of humor makes this enjoyable throughout; and with so much happening, it's easy to move on from the occasional dud.This is Kevin Smith having his Hollywood access and eating it too. He goes after Tinseltown with sharpened knives and a gleeful smirk, and it makes for a solid vehicle for his two mainstay stoners.

Jay and Silent Bob strike back is the story of best friends Jay and Silent Bob and anyone wishing to start with Kevin Smith's filmography should start with this film. It introduces the central character of the Universe and has cameos by almost everyone from other films. Plus a lot more, especially if you love Star Wars. The jokes are funny and the script flows very well. Cameos abound and some like Will Ferrell's ranger had me in stitches. Go see this film now.

This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I say this because it is the only movie I have ever laughed out loud at in a theater. I know a lot of people complain because the movie is toilet humor, vulgar language, and sex jokes. But so what? Kevin Smith took on serious topics before, this is his chance to kick back. If you go into this movie expecting to be enlightened, then there is something seriously wrong with you.In the film, Jay and Silent Bob discover that Miramax will be making a movie based on "Bluntman & Chronic", the comic based on themselves. Soon after discovering the insults people are slinging about the movie on the internet, Jay and Silent Bob head to Hollywood to shut the movie down and protect their "good" names. This movie ties together all of Smith's other Jersey crew films, with appearances by characters from "Clerks" through "Chasing Amy".While it is true that you won't get all the jokes unless you've seen Smith's other movies, that won't stop a person from enjoying it if they haven't. When I first saw "Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back" in theaters, I had only seen "Dogma" beforehand and I thought it was hilarious. Everyone in this movie puts on an awesome comedic performance, though I think my favorite comes from Will Ferrell as an inept wildlife marshal. If you don't mind some distasteful humor, you've got to see this movie.

A fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. It has a really impressive all-star cast and I also love the way it celebrates the previous films by Kevin Smith.

Writer/director/co-star Kevin Smith bids farewell to the Jay and Silent Bob characters in "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back," the first of the five movies featuring them in which they are the stars. He couldn't have come up with a better send-off for them. True, there's no big ideas behind this film like there were in "Dogma" or "Chasing Amy," but really, the grand ideas in those movies came from the main characters, not Jay and Silent Bob. They were there for comic relief mainly. Therefore, it makes sense that "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" would be pure slapstick comedy. Think about it, do you really want a foul-mouthed, over-sexed stoner telling you how to live your life?So anyway, it's a pure slapstick humor road movie. But unlike most slapstick comedies of late, this one's actually funny...extremely funny. Jay and Silent Bob find out that a movie is being made from a comic book (Bluntman & Chronic) that was based on them. They set off for Hollywood intending to stop it. Kevin Smith manages to pack so many jokes into what could have been another predictable, boring road comedy, that it's head and shoulders above the competition. I'm gonna have to go see it again, to make sure I didn't miss any jokes. Smith once again is showing off his incredible writing skills. Some people may not believe that any movie full of crude, R-rated humor is well written, but it is. Not only is it incredibly funny, but there's an intelligence and wit behind it that is unmistakably Kevin Smith's.I was also pleased with the quality of acting in the movie, especially Jason Mewes (Jay). In past View Askew movies, Mewes has been funny, despite not doing a particularly good job of acting. The one thing I was worried about was whether or not he'd be able to carry a film mostly by himself (since Silent Bob is mostly, well, silent). But he definitely proved that he has grown enough as an actor to be able to head up a movie. Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) does his usual decent job. Since he doesn't say much, mainly just reacts, he can't to a great job, but he's still very funny. He's the perfect companion (or should I say, "hetero life mate" for Jay, who's the complete opposite. There are no real other big parts in the movie, but there are tons of little cameos. Really, I think it'd be easier to list the people who DON'T appear in it. Some of the highlights include a scene with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon playing themselves, on the set of "Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season," a scene with Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek, as themselves, playing the stars of the Bluntman and Chronic movie, and a scene with Mark Hamill parodying Star Wars. But really, almost all of the jokes are highlights.For people who have seen the other films in Smith's New Jersey Chronicles series ("Clerks," "Mallrats," "Chasing Amy," & "Dogma"), there are quite a few in-jokes that you will find hilarious. In addition to playing himself, Affleck also reprises his role as Holden from "Chasing Amy," Jason Lee reprises his roles from "Chasing Amy" and "Mallrats," and Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran reprise their "Clerks" roles. Many others from the View Askewniverse appear as well. However, this movie is not only for fanboys. I saw it with a friend who hadn't seen any of the other four movies, and he thought it was hilarious too. The majority of the jokes will be understood by anyone. The in-jokes are like a little bonus from Smith to his fans, but they are not the focus of the movie.Kevin Smith also does a good job directing. Lately, it seems to have become popular to attack Smith's directing ability, but I think he did a good job. In his earlier movies, his directing was simply decent, not good, not bad. But he has made a lot of progress. This is one of the better directed comedies I've seen. Not Academy Award stuff, but most other comedy directors are pretty boring it seems.I want to briefly comment on the GLAAD protests of the film, citing large amounts of homophobia. I am gay, and I didn't find the film offensive. I think a lot of people are just taking the film way to seriously. It's not a serious film. People forget that Jay is, basically, a moron, so you can exactly take everything he says as the truth. Smith has said it's supposed to be a satire, and it works. Especially considering that in past films, Jay has admitted to sometimes fantasizing about guys. It's a satire, lighten up people. There's actually a funny scene where James Van Der Beek chastises Jason Biggs for calling something "gay," and also there's a funny disclaimer at the end.Which reminds me, stay for the credits. There's plenty of funny stuff, and Alanis Morissette shows up at the very end. All in all, "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is an extremely funny movie, plain and simple. Just don't take it seriously, because again, it's not a serious movie. There's still a few months to go, but I think this will prove to be the funniest movie of the year...actually, of the last many years. Quit reading this and go see it!Rating: 10/10

Jay and Silent Bob decide to go to Hollywood to avoid the shooting of a film about their alter ego, 'Bluntman and Chronic'. I am a great fan of Kevin Smith, however, this movie is not in the same level of 'Clerks', 'Mall Rats', 'Chasing Amy' and 'Dogma'. Maybe it is his most expensive movie, but he exceeds in fart jokes and other vulgarities. But there are also funny references to movies ('Star Wars', 'Good Will Hunting', Charlie's Angels'), actors (Ben Affleck, Matt Damon), studio ('Miramax'). The joke with Mark Hamill is great. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Império (do Besteirol) Contra-Ataca" ("The Empire (of the Bullshit) Counter-Attacks")

Let me start out by saying that like most people here, I am a Kevin Smith fan.  I thought clerks and chasing amy were great movies from a brilliant director.  Superb acting, great jokes, and great characters.Unfortunately, his newest movie, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, has none of those things.  First of all, let me point out that these characters are not the same Jay and Silent Bob many of you will remember from Clerks.  They were annoying, drug-dealing losers who played a small role in the movie. Somewhere along the way, however, they became lovable goons that are the center of a movie.  I'm not sure these characters are well developed enough to be the main characters.Anyways, on to the movie.  This movie starts out SLLLOOOOWWWWW...It was too bad that they bring back lots of great characters like Randall, Dante, and Brody, but only for quick cameo shots.  None of them offer anything to this movie.  It takes a while, but finally the jokes start rolling.  Sadly, Kevin Smith kind of gave in to the "American Pie" movie style, which is just making lewd comments and sexual jokes.  There is no intelligent, insightful dialogue, as you are used to from his other movies.I think that the one bright spot of the movie was Chris Rock's character. He displays the charm and wittiness that you have come to know from characters like Banky, Randall, Hooper X, etc.Overall, i would give this movie 4 stars out of 10.  There are some funny spots, but they do not really start until about halfway through the movie.

When I was first asked by a friend to watch this DVD with her my initial reaction was that it's not for me. Stoner humour is not my normal genre, cheech and chong bored me, as did many other films based around the same sort of thing. When she told me that it was the two goof balls out of Dogma I was even more concerned that I was about to give two hours of my life to trash.What a change! Kevin Smith has worked a wonder on this film, the quick (if a little predictable) one liners, the skill of the cast, alongside the non stop comedy coming from cameos, often playing parodies of themselves makes it worth buying a copy. The only thing that lets the movie down is it's "art school" look; in places it can look like Smith happens to have some high powered friends that helped to promote this movie and make it the success it was. If you want a light hearted film to watch over and over again, picking up the more subtle gags then it's one for you.Hope this helps. PG

Kevin Smith has done something not too many filmmakers are able to accomplish.  He has directed 5 films in a row, that have been in my mind all funny, often though provoking and just really good movies.  This is the fifth movie, the last of his New Jersey series with his always present Jay and Silent Bob, is not the best of his series but it is still possibly the funniest film I have seen this summer.  A consistently silly yet laugh out loud fest of jokes and usual one liners from Smith that scores well, even if it doesn't score as well as Dogma or Clerks.Here, the dynamic stoner duo find out through a weird new invention known as the internet (a place to bitch about movies and swap pornography) that a movie is being made about them, er, they're comic book alter egos from Chasing Amy known as Bluntman and Chronic.  They get so steamed they head for Miramax studios in Hollywood to stop the movie.  This starts the odyssey that brings up cameos including George Carlin (sick, but still funny), Carrie Fisher, Mark Hammil, and basically most of the stars from the past Smith movies.  This film is like a big inside joke, and if you get it, you'll like it more than others I guess.  But it is still funny for anyone who wants a good laugh and is tired of some of the really lame comedies of late.  It's a nice, if sometimes a little obscene (not in a bad way), gem.  One more note, not only does the movie bring mack many of the past stars of the view askew movies, but it also answers a question: what happened to Jay and Silent Bob after the end of Mallrats.  Kudos to Smith and the whole cast. A

This one is for complete morons who are proud of their status. I LOL'd only two times. This film was an "in-your-face-we-don't-care-about-you-and-you're-too-dumb-to-realize-it." There was an atmosphere of high school elitism: "We don't care about anyone but ourselves because we think we're funny and we're great." It was so egocentric and totally lazy. I saw little creativity and many stupid, stupid jokes. However, Ben and Matt should be commended for their ability to laugh at themselves. They and James VDB were funny. As for the film as a whole, it was a crashing bore for retards and geeks. One of the few films I have ever seen that truly fits the "AWFUL" category. Note that in the word awful are the two letters of F and U. Rated it 1.
