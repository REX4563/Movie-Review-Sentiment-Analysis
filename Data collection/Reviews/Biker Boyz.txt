Basically Fast and Furious on motorcycles.I'm a motorcycle fan, I loved this movie, the bikes are really amazing, stunts, soundtrack and etc.Okay, the plot is very generic and predictable, but not every movie is required to have deep plots, sometimes you just need to entertain the audience, which this movie achieves. In addition, it's no masterpiece, but it's still a great movie, especially for those who like motorcycles like me.

The days of Harley-Davidsons mastering the road are over. Nowadays color and plastic coat the fastest and most coveted motorcycles in the land, and `Biker Boyz' heralds the passing with unrestrained glee.Set among African-American biker clubs in Southern California, the film follows Kid (Derek Luke), a prodigious young motorcycle racer, in his quest for the title of `King of Cali,' currently held by Smoke (Lawrence Fishburne), leader of the Black Knights bike club. Smoke hesitates in accepting Kid's challenges, citing that Kid is not a member of a legitimate club. In one scene, Kid addresses Smoke's assistant with anger and frustration: `Are you racing? Or are you just blowin' smoke?' Kid begins his own club (the aptly named `Biker Boyz') and sets out for the crown of fastest biker. The rest of the film follows a sort of formula we have seen before, with the underdog taking on the inhumanly skilled antagonist at the end. Though the plot is weak, the talent both onscreen and off push the film into something the script alone could not hold. The actors, for the most part, excel in their respective roles. Fishburne turns what may have been a trivial role into one exuding sincerity and masculinity, holding to an effectively pensive and reserved demeanor. His presence on the screen legitimizes the film as not just another `Days of Thunder.' Fishburne's charisma must have extended to the rest of the cast, as even Kid Rock, who made his film debut in 2001's deplorable `Joe Dirt,' portrays his character with gusto and road-wise scruffiness. Director Reggie Rock Bythewood makes his presence felt in the film. Bythewood made a splash at Sundance a few years ago with his debut `Dancing in September.' With `Biker Boyz,' he manages to pull off something slightly extraordinary: he makes motorcycle racing entertaining. The camera freewheels around smoking tires, colorful racing suits and bouncing nightclubs with dizzying ease. His film is loosely based on a feature from the Los Angeles New Times on the biking subculture in California, and Bythewood tries to bring a sense of biker culture to the screen. The nonfiction foundation of the film shines through, displaying a bizarre sense of camaraderie between cyclists similar to that of a fraternal order.Despite its basically inane premise, the movie is not all bad. The poor title and plot outline summons memories of `Rollerball' and the like, but do not be deceived. `Biker Boyz' inspires some sense of genuine excitement and intrigue. As entertainment, it works on the same level as last year's `Spider-Man.' It cannot be praised as a piece of art, but the craftsmanship of the film is undeniable, which grants it a begrudged recommendation.

To begin with, I wasn't expecting really much from the film at all. More or less, I anticipated a "Fast and the Furious" with motorcycles. However, even to those expectations, the film falls way short. I was given the rather EXPECTED mediocre plot and cast of stereotypical characters; in addition to, the rather UNEXPECTED monotonous action sequences and poorly coordinated/directed stunts.While I spent 90 minutes wondering why these "hardcore" street racers had chromed-finished, colorful, graphic-designed bikes that looked like they were ready more for a show than any race, I kept watching these races that felt like the bikes were going 25 mph rather than the 200 mph their speedometers were reading. Each of the ~ 5 races in the film are pretty much exactly the same, and the final race is, to say the least, predictable and lame. I won't even begin to discuss the 'realism' of any of the races because I don't believe the movie is to be taken that serious in the first place...which is unfortunate.The verdict? Its a shame to say "save this movie for a rental night", because a movie of this nature should have only been appreciated on the big screen.

If you want to see a pointless story, dragged out over a full 1hour 50 minute film, then check this out, I can honestly get what was the plan, fast and furious but on bikes instead, but every moment you feel a story is coming or we might be getting somewhere with this film, it is simply either forgotten, or just falls flat. I would have said the only redeeming part was the fact Laurence fishburne had been involved in the project, but even his storyline is just dull. If we could have a son of anarchy type of film mixed to fast & furious then this could have worked, but this is typical sort of films coming out in the early 2000's, still this film is better than Torque. I would say, if you want something on that pays no attention, something you want on when doing work, or just not actually watching the film just doing other things then check it out, but I wouldn't recommend actually watching the film, as the story itself as mentioned just isn't really there, several cliche are thrown in during the film. Good luck if you do choice to watch.

Well, to start off, I have to say that Biker Boyz isn't a good movie. However, it is better than the other recent bike movie, Torque, if only because it tries to do something with itself.  But it fails none the less, perhaps for being too ambitious.  The bike crowd watches the movie hoping to see realism and some good racing. Instead they get straight-shot drag style races, which in real life involve little to no actual talent on a machine. Also, they'll be racing 160 mph one minute, and dead stopped the next.  It takes some time to come down from speeds like that.  The movie also frequently ignores the force of wind that would be present at high speeds, with the racers hardly tucked in at all.  The final race, much like many in Torque, takes place on a dirt road.  Apparently they aren't aware that these high end bikes are often called street fighters.Despite all that, there's actually an effort to tell a story.  It's an admirable effort, but many of the parts just slow the movie down.  It's often a painfully slow movie. Odd, since it's about a bunch of guys that race at speeds in excess of 100 mph.  The story is a coming of age one, for both Kid and Smoke.  They are both forced to confront issues, and in the end reconcile them.  The biker clubs are set up to mirror, I think, a sort of community, and therefore Kid's efforts to rise in the clubs are supposed to represent his finding his place in society.  The pieces are there, they were just poorly assembled. Folks most likely were expecting a quick, guilty pleasure like the Fast and Furious movies, and instead got a slow movie with mediocre action sequences.The acting isn't nearly as bad as most are saying. It's not Fishburne's finest moment but it's not like it stained his reputation or ability, just look at his fine work in Mystic River.  The writers made an effort to have three-dimensional characters.  For example, After Dog's dirty racing forces Kid to drop his bike at the track, he lends him his own bike to take on Smoke. Granted, it's for his own reasons, but it's not like he's the evil villain parody going "mu-ah-ha-ha" off in the corner.  I have to agree with another user that said it portrays black Americans in a positive way. They're not all stereotypes, they have their own personalities.  Smoke is confident, but level headed. Soul Train seems the stereotype, but we see a totally different side of him when we find he's a lawyer. 
So, it's not a good movie, but it makes an effort to be one, which counts for something.  For all it's lack of realism, it gets points for not having the absurd stunts that Torque did, like flipping a huge street bike (with a helicopter jet engine, mind you) mid air, and riding on top and through the passenger sections of moving trains.  Biker Boyz isn't good by any means, but it's not quite that bad.

The movie is barely even entertaining unless you are with a group of drinking buddies making fun of it.  The only reason to watch the forced plot, weak dialogue, music video camera work waste of time is if you love motorcycles, and like watching stunts performed on them.  Even then, if you really want to see that, just go get a specialty film.  FOR BIKE ENTHUSIAST ONLY.

My name is Simon Jago and below is my review of 'Biker Boyz'. I have no intention of elaborating my comments but have to produce a minimal amount of words in order for my comment to be published.Here's the back story to my viewing experience of 'Biker Boyz'. It was late on a Saturday night and I was writing my Dissertation for uni, and turned on the TV to have something on in the background. 'Biker Boyz' started and I thought I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and leave it on, boy was I wrong:REVIEW: 'This film is nothing more than a collection of established black actors, exploiting themselves in a horrible fast and the furious rip off with bikes.'BEST BIT: The tunnel vision that Laurence Fishburne uses to filter out the nonsense in the film to enhance his racing in a straight line abilities. SPOILER: THE OTHER GUY LEARNS TO USE IT AT THE END

I mean REALLY.. did anyone expect a high brow film here? If so, you're a knuckelhead and deserve to feel like you wasted your time.I expected very little more than to see a movie with "sexy" bikes. Personally, i enjoyed the movie as a whole too, plenty well. Played story and all... but so what? I ride, I'm a newb. I ride a rocket. But I'm no sunta'. Not sure I care to be one. But it is impressive to see what some people can do on these machines and not die. I agree the public displays of disregard are a bad model, but I hear about that stuff all the time and have seen a little in my area even, so it happens. The thing missing from the movie was a disclaimer stating that it's NOT smart to NOT wear a helmet, and that it's highly disrespectful to pull most of that stuff on public roads. As for Brendan's character not wearing during the races.. the point was that no one would take him serious for not wearing a helmet.. which showed the other characters didn't appreciate the cockiness.As for the comments about the half naked bodies and other eye candy body shots... gimme a break. It hardly took much time at all on the movie.When I originally saw the previews I was concerned that this movie would only encourage eejits to go out and buy rockets and cause havoc. Perhaps bombing on the big screen was a good thing, because I didn't see that fallout. I even joked about my watching it (not in the theater) being a bad thing... but I don't believe so now. I enjoyed this movie (perhaps I'm too easy to please) and do recommend it to people who don't take themselves too serious and don't expect a movie about bike gangs doing races and tricks to be high caliber.

I've never been much of a fan of motorcycles, but as always, I'm willing to accept there are those for whom their lives revolve around such contraptions. Horses for courses and all that. So I wasn't exactly enthusiastic when I got the chance to see this movie. However, I consoled myself with the knowledge that there might be some cool race scenes and flash hardware and maybe even some cool stunts. After all, I thought, it could hardly be worse than 2 Fast 2 Furious.......WRONG!This movie is the most tediously dire film I've seen this year! It makes 2Fast2Furious look like a Spielberg production. The plot is a standard "coming of age" drama, but without the drama. The only slightly interesting point in the entire film was when the three guys who go on to form the MC club of the title first get together and interact. Other than that, its boooooring! Nothing at all to hold your interest. No action, poor acting (esp. from Kid Rock) and even the bikes looked bored. The ending is so predictable that it's a relief when it finally comes.Oh, and did I mention that Hollywood expects us to swallow Derek Luke as an 18 year old? He's 30 next year for Chrissake!And as for Laurence Fishburne,....... don't get me started...oops! too late! What was with him? He looked like some mid-life crisis-er trying to regain his lost youth, but without any enthusiasm whatsoever. And Larry....lose the gut buddy, your MC jacket'll fit better.Overall a film to avoid at all costs.

An action-packed contemporary Western on wheels with desperado's who live every day on the edge. Lawyers and city workers by day, they take to the streets in their leathers to race by night.In the world of underground motorcycle clubs, the undefeated racer known as Smoke (Fishburne) is the undisputed "King of Cali." But Smoke's dominance of the set is about to be threatened by a young motorcycle racing prodigy called Kid (Luke), who is determined to win Smoke's helmet and earn the coveted title. An average movie which still i found very entertaining. I would recommend it for a rainy day or whenever. Biker Boyz 7/10

Lots of whacky dialogue makes for very low under the bus film like Biker Boyz, definitely watchable though! I like how I was 10 when the trailer came out damn I miss being little! Decent cast, soundtrack, and drama; I give it credit where it's earned.

Not sure what movie the other person was watching, but i enjoyed this movie very much. I also am not sure if they've ever rode on a motorcycle before but some of the tricks are not as easy as they look. I had no problems following the storyline and it is definitely one of the better motorcycle movies that i have seen. i am, however, unaware that a movie about motorcycle drag racing and bike gangs needs to have explosions and fancy effects. This isn't one of those "fast and the furious" movies about trying to catch the bad guy with illegal racing intermingled simply to make the movie stand out and have appeal. I do agree though that some of the race scenes appeared to be at 30 mph. All in all its a good movie and if you're into motorcycles, its especially good.

This ain't so bad as u hear. It's actually kinda good movie with  great feeling and quite good plot. It's a movie about bikes and relationships between bikers and father&son.And so said, if u like bikes and wanna c great driving this is a movie 4 u, otherwise go check something else.

This movie was a complete flop. Had Bythewood been smart enough to use the original unedited script as opposed to the one he and Craig hacked together he would have had a great movie under his directing debut. As it stands he has put together a flop (as evidenced by all the critics) and it shows that plagery gets you nowhere Reggie. You should have known better.

Kid is the son of Tariq aka "Slick Will", engineer to Smoke, who is the leader of the Black Knights motorcycle group and a legend on the streets. When Tariq is killed in a motorcycle accident, Kid drops off the scene for six months but returns determined to become more than just a prospect. His ultimate aim is to challenge Smoke himself and make his mark by taking down the biggest dog there is but first he must go legit and set up his own motorcycle gang with friends Stuntman and Primo.Opening with a really nice tracking shot (or series of shots, I'm not sure) this film had my interest early on but very quickly blew it. With an obvious and predictable establishing scene, the narrative arch is established and thus I began my weary trudge from start to finish, through countless music video scenes, unconvincing dialogue scenes and loads of motorcycles. It is very basic stuff and it never aspires to much. The characters are cut out of cardboard and the dialogue is awful, this might cut the mustard if the film was an out and out action film but it isn't. Instead it is supposed to be a character driven film and thus it is a big problem for it to not have characters or convincing dialogue. Sadly it is a mess in regards the writing and plotting and only the forgiving will find the material worth two hours of their time.The action is pretty weak. I didn't think any of the races were exciting and although they are well done, all of them could have sorely used the emotions of the characters to feed into them. As it is the failure of the plot means that much of the film is lacking and feels rather pointless. Occasionally it hints at depth and humanity but the occasional spark is totally drowned out in a sea of noise. The music video goals of the film are met but personally I'm glad not to be in the demographic sector that is tricked into thinking that this makes for a good film.The cast are mixed, containing people that I expected better from and people that deserve stuff like this. Fishburne may well have expected more from the film because at times you can see him reaching, sadly he cannot achieve the impossible and any glimmer of a good performance is swamped. Luke struggles from the start. He is pretty and charismatic here but he can't deliver emotion and understanding that isn't in the script and his narration is terrible. The support cast are roundly average with obvious performances from Jones, Hounsou, Fehr and others. Good is sexy but pretty vacant while I'm not sure why Bonet bothered to turn up for so little.Overall then a fairly pointless film that shrugs off any character potential it may have had in favour of MTV visuals, clunky dialogue and mostly average performances at best. You can see the potential in the story but across several aspects the film fails to deliver this potential and just churns out a totally unnecessary film that doesn't deserve any of your time.

I saw Biker Boyz last night.  While the plot was horrendous and hard to follow, I thought the acting wasn't bad.  The editing and cinematography was done to try to give the audience the feel of being on a bike at 100+ miles per hour.  I wouldn't say see this movie if you are looking for quality plot, but as your basic standard hollywood fare, it's no worse than some of the other crap that's out there.  I really also enjoyed how the movie was NOT violent and they showed how Black people can have a great time w/o guns and violence (notice the only weapon in the movie is brandished by the Italian gang).  I also really enjoyed Orlando Jones' performance.  See if you can try to spot the many appearances by stars from the past - Sally Richardson, Kadeem Hardison and others!

As a motorcycle rider (GSXR-1000) I went to this movie with anticipation and excitement.  Aside from a few nice paintjobs and a few rolling stoppies, this movie was quite weak.  And why didn't they release this when it was warmer?  They might have gotten a better biker turn out.  I was expecting a Fast & The Furious style with crotch rockets, but what I got was a ghetto-fab, half-helmet, cowboy hat-wearing, bandana-wielding group of amateur riders with minimal acting skills.  If you want to see REAL racing and tricks (and quite-possibly a better story line), go to your local shop and pick up a Star Boys or Vegas Extreme video/dvd.  If you own a bike, check this movie out, but don't expect too much.  You'll walk away thinking, "Wow, that was a nice paint job" and nothing else.

Six months after his father is killed by a low-flying motorcycle, precocious 18-year-old Kid (played by 29-year-old Derek Luke) returns to the urban biker scene, forming his own MC club—the camp-sounding Biker Boyz—so that he can claim himself the title of The King of Cali, currently held by biker legend Smoke (Laurence Fishburne).Clearly intended to glamorise the motorbike road racing scene in the same way Fast and the Furious films did for street car racing, Biker Boyz is a howlingly bad coming-of-age drama interspersed with ridiculous race scenes, all told without the slightest hint of irony. It's such a stereotypical stinker, packed to the rafters with rebellious teen clichés, that I couldn't help but enjoy myself just a bit.The good: the roving camera-work (especially the opening tracking shot), the trick-tastic bike riding, Meagan Good's cleavage.The bad (and consequently rather amusing): Kid Rock as a white trash biker named Dogg, an out-of-shape Laurence Fishburne beating up ripped Derek Luke, those nasty yellow Biker Boyz jackets, the lavish biker parties, the laughable dialogue loaded with ebonics. Tru dat.

Biker Boyz is a film that is great despite its numerous flaws. The film is built using thousands of clichés and stereotypes untrue to the real world of street racing. However, despite its many flaws, which are numerous and obvious the films spirit is maintained and despite its poor score on IMDb viewed in the right way this film is incredibly good. There's a tendency to view a film coming out of the black community based on a mainly white area of life as poor before the film has even been watched. There's reasons for this and many films doing this are right to be critically panned. Some of the acting in the movie is poor, and whilst the plot is clichéd for the genre and the crew didn't do themselves any favours by not accentuating the emotional points of the plot, the film is still a solid and emotional drama. I gave this film 7 out of 10 due to the empathetic acting of Kid and Smoke (Fishbourne turns in a great performance) and hope that potential viewers aren't put off by the poor rating that it has received.

Oh my God was this movie bad!  They tried to make it into a Fast and the Furious on bikes, which when you think about it, couldn't have been that difficult since F&F was no gift either.  But it really is impressive how terrible this movie is!********** SPOILERS ***************** (movie is so bad, it doesn't matter)First of all, could they have picked a more lame name for their gang? Biker Boyz????  The main characters decide to start their own biker gang, and what do they call themselves?  Biker Boyz????  Were they trying to steal the fire from the Back Street Boys?  What a bunch of limp-wristed morons!  And then they get two Asians who want to join..... on ATVs!!!  ATV-Boyz??? Hahahahahahaha!  You have to see the stunts in this pile of junk, you call those motorcycle stunts?  They were terrible, I was laughing my head off when it was supposed to be cool!  It was especially hilarious when the third founding member, a Latino guy, tries to show them how good he is on a bike. He actually stands up and sticks his leg off the back of the bike! That's it!  Really!  That's it!   Oooooh, you have talent, you have to help us start a biker club!!!  HAhahahahahahahahahha!And then there is the story of how poor old Jaleel (bad name) loses his father to a bike accident (boohoo) and his mother doesn't want him involved in bikes.  They (of course) live in a perfect suburban home, she drives nice cars, and wears nice clothes.  But when he invites her to the annual biker party?  She turns up looking like a 2-bit tramp!  Way to go Mom! Hahahahahahha!The street racing scenes were boring as sin.  For instance, in the big climactic scene, the course they are racing on is on some "Greedy Farmer's Field".  You can see that the finish line is only about a mile away before they even start.  But they get their bikes up to 200 miles and hour and it takes roughly 10 minutes to race the mile!  It was laughable!  What in the world was Laurence Fishburne thinking?  The only reason I gave this movie a 2 was that he was in the Matrix.  That's it, there is no association with The Matrix at all, but hey, he was in it.And there was the boohoo father-son scene, hahahahahha!  Standard fare in trying to bring a smidgen of drama to the flick.  Then Jaleel promises his mother he will never race again..... oooooooohhhhh!  Do you think he will keep his promise?????    Do you?????  I don't know, there are some pretty compelling reasons to race out there!!   Like, BE A MAN!  A challenge was issued!  And a bunch of other macho BS!  HAHAHAHAHAH!  I think the only audience who would be impressed are The Village People!  The characters in La Cage Aux Folles were more macho than these losers!  And, oh my God, I nearly forgot..... Kid Rock!  HAHAHAHAHA!  He should call himself Skid Rock! Hahahahaha!  Man, talk about the poster boy for trailer park boys!  Is he EVER gross!  And you have to see his gay helmet with the dog collar! HAHAHAHAHAHA! There was nothing of interest in this movie whatsoever!  Even the music was terrible, what a complete and utter waste of time!  At least we all now know that Lisa Bonet is still alive...... (barely).....

Biker Boyz ROCKED! It did have a good plot and story line and also taught an important lesson (I'll let you figure that out). Amazingly enough, all the tricks in the movie were real and that adds to the excitement. I give this movie a 7. Why? Because it was a terrific movie but there was a little bad acting in it and some of stuff that happened could draw the audience away from the main thing...RIDING. Learning the strengths and weaknesses of riding the bike and of the rider themselves. It's all important. This movie shows passion and attitude. Freedom, competition, and standing up for what one believes in. There is a lot to see and a lot to prepare for. It's all worth it in the end. The main reason that keeps my vote away from a ten is during a part of the movie, a race is going and the person who won...well, I don't think that they earned the title...The way that person won it was by the help of the competitor....(Hint: Letting off the throttle) You need to see it to find out what I mean..Great movie and NOT A WASTE OF TIME.

This film is bad- bad idea, bad script, bad acting. What the hell was Larry Fishburne thinking when he agreed to do it? Please don't watch this unless you're really, really bored.It wanted to be The Fast and the Furious on motorbikes, but TFATF realised that a film about street racing needs more than just the races; there's not much excitement in a "whose bike is the fastest?" race. So I guess it's meant to be a film about trying to be accepted, or proving yourself, or something, but to be honest I didn't care about any of the characters or what the hell they did. TFATF has undercover cops, various criminal activities, and reasonably interesting characters; Biker Boyz doesn't.

Great actors, great plot, and I love the bikes! A Must See movie with awesome tricks, soundtrack and the variety of biker groups is off the chain! Great Movie and I can't wait for a Biker Boyz 2! Make it smokin baby💯

Maybe Biker Boyz wasn't as good as I thought it was, but the fact of the matter is, I saw "Torque" before I saw Biker Boyz. And after having seen "Torque", any movie with street bikes in them that didn't run on pixie dust was going to be better. I honestly disregarded the acting and the plot to simply gawk at the bikes and what the riders would do on the bikes. There were some cool stunts and really pretty machines. Those bikes were so beautiful that I know it has skewed my judgment of the movie; but hey, at least I'm honest about it.The plot wasn't all bad... the racing aspect of it that is. Besides the racing for "lids" story, and trying to dethrone the top gun, the rest of the movie was just filler. "Biker Boyz" is decent enough to kill time.

I've come up with this when it comes to movies released in the month of January:  they are all pretty much overstock from the previous year that the studio was too embarassed to release.  Movies released just after christmas and during January are the equivalent of bottom-of-the-bin leftover holiday items in a store that nobody thought was good enough to be sold before Christmas, so they've been re-packaged as something cool and new, when in reality they're just more misleading re-hashes.  That's what exactly what movies like Biker Boys, Kangaroo Jack, and Just Married are.  But since I'm only reviewing Biker Boys, I'll start my review.  Here it is:  Do not see it.  That's the kindest I can be with this one.  Larry Fishbourne commented that Biker Boys was a modern day "western", only with bikes instead of horses, helmets instead of cowboy hats, and asphalt instead of whatever was the equivalent of what cowboys and their horses rode on.  I'm here commenting that this is NOT an urban western.  I don't even know what to call it, but I know it's not good.  Bad acting, NO realism (we need at least SOME ground in reality here), and cheap effects.  0 out of 10

Basically Fast and Furious on motorcycles.I'm a motorcycle fan, I loved this movie, the bikes are really amazing, stunts, soundtrack and etc.Okay, the plot is very generic and predictable, but not every movie is required to have deep plots, sometimes you just need to entertain the audience, which this movie achieves. In addition, it's no masterpiece, but it's still a great movie, especially for those who like motorcycles like me.

The days of Harley-Davidsons mastering the road are over. Nowadays color and plastic coat the fastest and most coveted motorcycles in the land, and `Biker Boyz' heralds the passing with unrestrained glee.Set among African-American biker clubs in Southern California, the film follows Kid (Derek Luke), a prodigious young motorcycle racer, in his quest for the title of `King of Cali,' currently held by Smoke (Lawrence Fishburne), leader of the Black Knights bike club. Smoke hesitates in accepting Kid's challenges, citing that Kid is not a member of a legitimate club. In one scene, Kid addresses Smoke's assistant with anger and frustration: `Are you racing? Or are you just blowin' smoke?' Kid begins his own club (the aptly named `Biker Boyz') and sets out for the crown of fastest biker. The rest of the film follows a sort of formula we have seen before, with the underdog taking on the inhumanly skilled antagonist at the end. Though the plot is weak, the talent both onscreen and off push the film into something the script alone could not hold. The actors, for the most part, excel in their respective roles. Fishburne turns what may have been a trivial role into one exuding sincerity and masculinity, holding to an effectively pensive and reserved demeanor. His presence on the screen legitimizes the film as not just another `Days of Thunder.' Fishburne's charisma must have extended to the rest of the cast, as even Kid Rock, who made his film debut in 2001's deplorable `Joe Dirt,' portrays his character with gusto and road-wise scruffiness. Director Reggie Rock Bythewood makes his presence felt in the film. Bythewood made a splash at Sundance a few years ago with his debut `Dancing in September.' With `Biker Boyz,' he manages to pull off something slightly extraordinary: he makes motorcycle racing entertaining. The camera freewheels around smoking tires, colorful racing suits and bouncing nightclubs with dizzying ease. His film is loosely based on a feature from the Los Angeles New Times on the biking subculture in California, and Bythewood tries to bring a sense of biker culture to the screen. The nonfiction foundation of the film shines through, displaying a bizarre sense of camaraderie between cyclists similar to that of a fraternal order.Despite its basically inane premise, the movie is not all bad. The poor title and plot outline summons memories of `Rollerball' and the like, but do not be deceived. `Biker Boyz' inspires some sense of genuine excitement and intrigue. As entertainment, it works on the same level as last year's `Spider-Man.' It cannot be praised as a piece of art, but the craftsmanship of the film is undeniable, which grants it a begrudged recommendation.

To begin with, I wasn't expecting really much from the film at all. More or less, I anticipated a "Fast and the Furious" with motorcycles. However, even to those expectations, the film falls way short. I was given the rather EXPECTED mediocre plot and cast of stereotypical characters; in addition to, the rather UNEXPECTED monotonous action sequences and poorly coordinated/directed stunts.While I spent 90 minutes wondering why these "hardcore" street racers had chromed-finished, colorful, graphic-designed bikes that looked like they were ready more for a show than any race, I kept watching these races that felt like the bikes were going 25 mph rather than the 200 mph their speedometers were reading. Each of the ~ 5 races in the film are pretty much exactly the same, and the final race is, to say the least, predictable and lame. I won't even begin to discuss the 'realism' of any of the races because I don't believe the movie is to be taken that serious in the first place...which is unfortunate.The verdict? Its a shame to say "save this movie for a rental night", because a movie of this nature should have only been appreciated on the big screen.

Good luck if you do choice to watch.

Well, to start off, I have to say that Biker Boyz isn't a good movie. However, it is better than the other recent bike movie, Torque, if only because it tries to do something with itself.  But it fails none the less, perhaps for being too ambitious.  The bike crowd watches the movie hoping to see realism and some good racing. Instead they get straight-shot drag style races, which in real life involve little to no actual talent on a machine. Also, they'll be racing 160 mph one minute, and dead stopped the next.  It takes some time to come down from speeds like that.  The movie also frequently ignores the force of wind that would be present at high speeds, with the racers hardly tucked in at all.  The final race, much like many in Torque, takes place on a dirt road.  Apparently they aren't aware that these high end bikes are often called street fighters.Despite all that, there's actually an effort to tell a story.  It's an admirable effort, but many of the parts just slow the movie down.  It's often a painfully slow movie. Odd, since it's about a bunch of guys that race at speeds in excess of 100 mph.  The story is a coming of age one, for both Kid and Smoke.  They are both forced to confront issues, and in the end reconcile them.  The biker clubs are set up to mirror, I think, a sort of community, and therefore Kid's efforts to rise in the clubs are supposed to represent his finding his place in society.  The pieces are there, they were just poorly assembled. Folks most likely were expecting a quick, guilty pleasure like the Fast and Furious movies, and instead got a slow movie with mediocre action sequences.The acting isn't nearly as bad as most are saying. It's not Fishburne's finest moment but it's not like it stained his reputation or ability, just look at his fine work in Mystic River.  The writers made an effort to have three-dimensional characters.  For example, After Dog's dirty racing forces Kid to drop his bike at the track, he lends him his own bike to take on Smoke. Granted, it's for his own reasons, but it's not like he's the evil villain parody going "mu-ah-ha-ha" off in the corner.  I have to agree with another user that said it portrays black Americans in a positive way. They're not all stereotypes, they have their own personalities.  Smoke is confident, but level headed. Soul Train seems the stereotype, but we see a totally different side of him when we find he's a lawyer. 
So, it's not a good movie, but it makes an effort to be one, which counts for something.  For all it's lack of realism, it gets points for not having the absurd stunts that Torque did, like flipping a huge street bike (with a helicopter jet engine, mind you) mid air, and riding on top and through the passenger sections of moving trains.  Biker Boyz isn't good by any means, but it's not quite that bad.

The movie is barely even entertaining unless you are with a group of drinking buddies making fun of it.  The only reason to watch the forced plot, weak dialogue, music video camera work waste of time is if you love motorcycles, and like watching stunts performed on them.  Even then, if you really want to see that, just go get a specialty film.  FOR BIKE ENTHUSIAST ONLY.

My name is Simon Jago and below is my review of 'Biker Boyz'. I have no intention of elaborating my comments but have to produce a minimal amount of words in order for my comment to be published.Here's the back story to my viewing experience of 'Biker Boyz'. It was late on a Saturday night and I was writing my Dissertation for uni, and turned on the TV to have something on in the background. 'Biker Boyz' started and I thought I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and leave it on, boy was I wrong:REVIEW: 'This film is nothing more than a collection of established black actors, exploiting themselves in a horrible fast and the furious rip off with bikes.'BEST BIT: The tunnel vision that Laurence Fishburne uses to filter out the nonsense in the film to enhance his racing in a straight line abilities. SPOILER: THE OTHER GUY LEARNS TO USE IT AT THE END

I mean REALLY.. did anyone expect a high brow film here? If so, you're a knuckelhead and deserve to feel like you wasted your time.I expected very little more than to see a movie with "sexy" bikes. Personally, i enjoyed the movie as a whole too, plenty well. Played story and all... but so what? I ride, I'm a newb. I ride a rocket. But I'm no sunta'. Not sure I care to be one. But it is impressive to see what some people can do on these machines and not die. I agree the public displays of disregard are a bad model, but I hear about that stuff all the time and have seen a little in my area even, so it happens. The thing missing from the movie was a disclaimer stating that it's NOT smart to NOT wear a helmet, and that it's highly disrespectful to pull most of that stuff on public roads. As for Brendan's character not wearing during the races.. the point was that no one would take him serious for not wearing a helmet.. which showed the other characters didn't appreciate the cockiness.As for the comments about the half naked bodies and other eye candy body shots... gimme a break. It hardly took much time at all on the movie.When I originally saw the previews I was concerned that this movie would only encourage eejits to go out and buy rockets and cause havoc. Perhaps bombing on the big screen was a good thing, because I didn't see that fallout. I even joked about my watching it (not in the theater) being a bad thing... but I don't believe so now. I enjoyed this movie (perhaps I'm too easy to please) and do recommend it to people who don't take themselves too serious and don't expect a movie about bike gangs doing races and tricks to be high caliber.

I've never been much of a fan of motorcycles, but as always, I'm willing to accept there are those for whom their lives revolve around such contraptions. Horses for courses and all that. So I wasn't exactly enthusiastic when I got the chance to see this movie. However, I consoled myself with the knowledge that there might be some cool race scenes and flash hardware and maybe even some cool stunts. After all, I thought, it could hardly be worse than 2 Fast 2 Furious.......WRONG!This movie is the most tediously dire film I've seen this year! It makes 2Fast2Furious look like a Spielberg production. The plot is a standard "coming of age" drama, but without the drama. The only slightly interesting point in the entire film was when the three guys who go on to form the MC club of the title first get together and interact. Other than that, its boooooring! Nothing at all to hold your interest. No action, poor acting (esp. from Kid Rock) and even the bikes looked bored. The ending is so predictable that it's a relief when it finally comes.Oh, and did I mention that Hollywood expects us to swallow Derek Luke as an 18 year old? He's 30 next year for Chrissake!And as for Laurence Fishburne,....... don't get me started...oops! too late! What was with him? He looked like some mid-life crisis-er trying to regain his lost youth, but without any enthusiasm whatsoever. And Larry....lose the gut buddy, your MC jacket'll fit better.Overall a film to avoid at all costs.

An action-packed contemporary Western on wheels with desperado's who live every day on the edge. Lawyers and city workers by day, they take to the streets in their leathers to race by night.In the world of underground motorcycle clubs, the undefeated racer known as Smoke (Fishburne) is the undisputed "King of Cali." But Smoke's dominance of the set is about to be threatened by a young motorcycle racing prodigy called Kid (Luke), who is determined to win Smoke's helmet and earn the coveted title. An average movie which still i found very entertaining. I would recommend it for a rainy day or whenever. Biker Boyz 7/10

Lots of whacky dialogue makes for very low under the bus film like Biker Boyz, definitely watchable though! I like how I was 10 when the trailer came out damn I miss being little! Decent cast, soundtrack, and drama; I give it credit where it's earned.

Not sure what movie the other person was watching, but i enjoyed this movie very much. I also am not sure if they've ever rode on a motorcycle before but some of the tricks are not as easy as they look. I had no problems following the storyline and it is definitely one of the better motorcycle movies that i have seen. i am, however, unaware that a movie about motorcycle drag racing and bike gangs needs to have explosions and fancy effects. This isn't one of those "fast and the furious" movies about trying to catch the bad guy with illegal racing intermingled simply to make the movie stand out and have appeal. I do agree though that some of the race scenes appeared to be at 30 mph. All in all its a good movie and if you're into motorcycles, its especially good.

This ain't so bad as u hear. It's actually kinda good movie with  great feeling and quite good plot. It's a movie about bikes and relationships between bikers and father&son.And so said, if u like bikes and wanna c great driving this is a movie 4 u, otherwise go check something else.

This movie was a complete flop. Had Bythewood been smart enough to use the original unedited script as opposed to the one he and Craig hacked together he would have had a great movie under his directing debut. As it stands he has put together a flop (as evidenced by all the critics) and it shows that plagery gets you nowhere Reggie. You should have known better.

Kid is the son of Tariq aka "Slick Will", engineer to Smoke, who is the leader of the Black Knights motorcycle group and a legend on the streets. When Tariq is killed in a motorcycle accident, Kid drops off the scene for six months but returns determined to become more than just a prospect. His ultimate aim is to challenge Smoke himself and make his mark by taking down the biggest dog there is but first he must go legit and set up his own motorcycle gang with friends Stuntman and Primo.Opening with a really nice tracking shot (or series of shots, I'm not sure) this film had my interest early on but very quickly blew it. With an obvious and predictable establishing scene, the narrative arch is established and thus I began my weary trudge from start to finish, through countless music video scenes, unconvincing dialogue scenes and loads of motorcycles. It is very basic stuff and it never aspires to much. The characters are cut out of cardboard and the dialogue is awful, this might cut the mustard if the film was an out and out action film but it isn't. Instead it is supposed to be a character driven film and thus it is a big problem for it to not have characters or convincing dialogue. Sadly it is a mess in regards the writing and plotting and only the forgiving will find the material worth two hours of their time.The action is pretty weak. I didn't think any of the races were exciting and although they are well done, all of them could have sorely used the emotions of the characters to feed into them. As it is the failure of the plot means that much of the film is lacking and feels rather pointless. Occasionally it hints at depth and humanity but the occasional spark is totally drowned out in a sea of noise. The music video goals of the film are met but personally I'm glad not to be in the demographic sector that is tricked into thinking that this makes for a good film.The cast are mixed, containing people that I expected better from and people that deserve stuff like this. Fishburne may well have expected more from the film because at times you can see him reaching, sadly he cannot achieve the impossible and any glimmer of a good performance is swamped. Luke struggles from the start. He is pretty and charismatic here but he can't deliver emotion and understanding that isn't in the script and his narration is terrible. The support cast are roundly average with obvious performances from Jones, Hounsou, Fehr and others. Good is sexy but pretty vacant while I'm not sure why Bonet bothered to turn up for so little.Overall then a fairly pointless film that shrugs off any character potential it may have had in favour of MTV visuals, clunky dialogue and mostly average performances at best. You can see the potential in the story but across several aspects the film fails to deliver this potential and just churns out a totally unnecessary film that doesn't deserve any of your time.

I saw Biker Boyz last night.  While the plot was horrendous and hard to follow, I thought the acting wasn't bad.  The editing and cinematography was done to try to give the audience the feel of being on a bike at 100+ miles per hour.  I wouldn't say see this movie if you are looking for quality plot, but as your basic standard hollywood fare, it's no worse than some of the other crap that's out there.  I really also enjoyed how the movie was NOT violent and they showed how Black people can have a great time w/o guns and violence (notice the only weapon in the movie is brandished by the Italian gang).  I also really enjoyed Orlando Jones' performance.  See if you can try to spot the many appearances by stars from the past - Sally Richardson, Kadeem Hardison and others!

As a motorcycle rider (GSXR-1000) I went to this movie with anticipation and excitement.  Aside from a few nice paintjobs and a few rolling stoppies, this movie was quite weak.  And why didn't they release this when it was warmer?  They might have gotten a better biker turn out.  I was expecting a Fast & The Furious style with crotch rockets, but what I got was a ghetto-fab, half-helmet, cowboy hat-wearing, bandana-wielding group of amateur riders with minimal acting skills.  If you want to see REAL racing and tricks (and quite-possibly a better story line), go to your local shop and pick up a Star Boys or Vegas Extreme video/dvd.  If you own a bike, check this movie out, but don't expect too much.  You'll walk away thinking, "Wow, that was a nice paint job" and nothing else.

Six months after his father is killed by a low-flying motorcycle, precocious 18-year-old Kid (played by 29-year-old Derek Luke) returns to the urban biker scene, forming his own MC club—the camp-sounding Biker Boyz—so that he can claim himself the title of The King of Cali, currently held by biker legend Smoke (Laurence Fishburne).Clearly intended to glamorise the motorbike road racing scene in the same way Fast and the Furious films did for street car racing, Biker Boyz is a howlingly bad coming-of-age drama interspersed with ridiculous race scenes, all told without the slightest hint of irony. It's such a stereotypical stinker, packed to the rafters with rebellious teen clichés, that I couldn't help but enjoy myself just a bit.The good: the roving camera-work (especially the opening tracking shot), the trick-tastic bike riding, Meagan Good's cleavage.The bad (and consequently rather amusing): Kid Rock as a white trash biker named Dogg, an out-of-shape Laurence Fishburne beating up ripped Derek Luke, those nasty yellow Biker Boyz jackets, the lavish biker parties, the laughable dialogue loaded with ebonics. Tru dat.

Biker Boyz is a film that is great despite its numerous flaws. The film is built using thousands of clichés and stereotypes untrue to the real world of street racing. However, despite its many flaws, which are numerous and obvious the films spirit is maintained and despite its poor score on IMDb viewed in the right way this film is incredibly good. There's a tendency to view a film coming out of the black community based on a mainly white area of life as poor before the film has even been watched. There's reasons for this and many films doing this are right to be critically panned. Some of the acting in the movie is poor, and whilst the plot is clichéd for the genre and the crew didn't do themselves any favours by not accentuating the emotional points of the plot, the film is still a solid and emotional drama. I gave this film 7 out of 10 due to the empathetic acting of Kid and Smoke (Fishbourne turns in a great performance) and hope that potential viewers aren't put off by the poor rating that it has received.

Oh my God was this movie bad!  They tried to make it into a Fast and the Furious on bikes, which when you think about it, couldn't have been that difficult since F&F was no gift either.  But it really is impressive how terrible this movie is!********** SPOILERS ***************** (movie is so bad, it doesn't matter)First of all, could they have picked a more lame name for their gang? Biker Boyz????  The main characters decide to start their own biker gang, and what do they call themselves?  Biker Boyz????  Were they trying to steal the fire from the Back Street Boys?  What a bunch of limp-wristed morons!  And then they get two Asians who want to join..... on ATVs!!!  ATV-Boyz??? Hahahahahahaha!  You have to see the stunts in this pile of junk, you call those motorcycle stunts?  They were terrible, I was laughing my head off when it was supposed to be cool!  It was especially hilarious when the third founding member, a Latino guy, tries to show them how good he is on a bike. He actually stands up and sticks his leg off the back of the bike! That's it!  Really!  That's it!   Oooooh, you have talent, you have to help us start a biker club!!!  HAhahahahahahahahahha!And then there is the story of how poor old Jaleel (bad name) loses his father to a bike accident (boohoo) and his mother doesn't want him involved in bikes.  They (of course) live in a perfect suburban home, she drives nice cars, and wears nice clothes.  But when he invites her to the annual biker party?  She turns up looking like a 2-bit tramp!  Way to go Mom! Hahahahahahha!The street racing scenes were boring as sin.  For instance, in the big climactic scene, the course they are racing on is on some "Greedy Farmer's Field".  You can see that the finish line is only about a mile away before they even start.  But they get their bikes up to 200 miles and hour and it takes roughly 10 minutes to race the mile!  It was laughable!  What in the world was Laurence Fishburne thinking?  The only reason I gave this movie a 2 was that he was in the Matrix.  That's it, there is no association with The Matrix at all, but hey, he was in it.And there was the boohoo father-son scene, hahahahahha!  Standard fare in trying to bring a smidgen of drama to the flick.  Then Jaleel promises his mother he will never race again..... oooooooohhhhh!  Do you think he will keep his promise?????    Do you?????  I don't know, there are some pretty compelling reasons to race out there!!   Like, BE A MAN!  A challenge was issued!  And a bunch of other macho BS!  HAHAHAHAHAH!  I think the only audience who would be impressed are The Village People!  The characters in La Cage Aux Folles were more macho than these losers!  And, oh my God, I nearly forgot..... Kid Rock!  HAHAHAHAHA!  He should call himself Skid Rock! Hahahahaha!  Man, talk about the poster boy for trailer park boys!  Is he EVER gross!  And you have to see his gay helmet with the dog collar! HAHAHAHAHAHA! There was nothing of interest in this movie whatsoever!  Even the music was terrible, what a complete and utter waste of time!  At least we all now know that Lisa Bonet is still alive...... (barely).....

Biker Boyz ROCKED! It did have a good plot and story line and also taught an important lesson (I'll let you figure that out). Amazingly enough, all the tricks in the movie were real and that adds to the excitement. I give this movie a 7. Why? Because it was a terrific movie but there was a little bad acting in it and some of stuff that happened could draw the audience away from the main thing...RIDING. Learning the strengths and weaknesses of riding the bike and of the rider themselves. It's all important. This movie shows passion and attitude. Freedom, competition, and standing up for what one believes in. There is a lot to see and a lot to prepare for. It's all worth it in the end. The main reason that keeps my vote away from a ten is during a part of the movie, a race is going and the person who won...well, I don't think that they earned the title...The way that person won it was by the help of the competitor....(Hint: Letting off the throttle) You need to see it to find out what I mean..Great movie and NOT A WASTE OF TIME.

This film is bad- bad idea, bad script, bad acting. What the hell was Larry Fishburne thinking when he agreed to do it? Please don't watch this unless you're really, really bored.It wanted to be The Fast and the Furious on motorbikes, but TFATF realised that a film about street racing needs more than just the races; there's not much excitement in a "whose bike is the fastest?" race. So I guess it's meant to be a film about trying to be accepted, or proving yourself, or something, but to be honest I didn't care about any of the characters or what the hell they did. TFATF has undercover cops, various criminal activities, and reasonably interesting characters; Biker Boyz doesn't.

Great actors, great plot, and I love the bikes! A Must See movie with awesome tricks, soundtrack and the variety of biker groups is off the chain! Great Movie and I can't wait for a Biker Boyz 2! Make it smokin baby💯

Maybe Biker Boyz wasn't as good as I thought it was, but the fact of the matter is, I saw "Torque" before I saw Biker Boyz. And after having seen "Torque", any movie with street bikes in them that didn't run on pixie dust was going to be better. I honestly disregarded the acting and the plot to simply gawk at the bikes and what the riders would do on the bikes. There were some cool stunts and really pretty machines. Those bikes were so beautiful that I know it has skewed my judgment of the movie; but hey, at least I'm honest about it.The plot wasn't all bad... the racing aspect of it that is. Besides the racing for "lids" story, and trying to dethrone the top gun, the rest of the movie was just filler. "Biker Boyz" is decent enough to kill time.

I've come up with this when it comes to movies released in the month of January:  they are all pretty much overstock from the previous year that the studio was too embarassed to release.  Movies released just after christmas and during January are the equivalent of bottom-of-the-bin leftover holiday items in a store that nobody thought was good enough to be sold before Christmas, so they've been re-packaged as something cool and new, when in reality they're just more misleading re-hashes.  That's what exactly what movies like Biker Boys, Kangaroo Jack, and Just Married are.  But since I'm only reviewing Biker Boys, I'll start my review.  Here it is:  Do not see it.  That's the kindest I can be with this one.  Larry Fishbourne commented that Biker Boys was a modern day "western", only with bikes instead of horses, helmets instead of cowboy hats, and asphalt instead of whatever was the equivalent of what cowboys and their horses rode on.  I'm here commenting that this is NOT an urban western.  I don't even know what to call it, but I know it's not good.  Bad acting, NO realism (we need at least SOME ground in reality here), and cheap effects.  0 out of 10
