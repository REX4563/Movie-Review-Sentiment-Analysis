Charlize Theron cuts an exceptionally striking presence as the heroine of this smashing action-oriented fantasy involving a rebel fighter in 2415 whose assignment is to kill the leader of a totalitarian regime; turns out, she recognizes him as a man who once meant a great deal to her and finds she can't eliminate him (nor vice-versa), precipitating a coupe amongst his people. Though exceptionally flashy, this MTV production (based upon their animated series) has its roots steeped in the past, with a plot that admittedly recalls dozens of enemy-for-the-people adventures. Despite some intentionally amusing asides, the dialogue is fairly stilted (though there isn't much of it, which is ultimately a plus) and the editing is occasionally sharp though it eliminates things we should be seeing to clarify the narrative (like how Æon Flux manages to climb aboard and exit a flying monument). Frances McDormand's role as Theron's boss is left a bit sketchy (who does she get her orders from?) and her reluctance to give Æon even the slightest benefit of the doubt is perplexing. The action sequences are elaborately, entertainingly staged, and the crisp, expensive-seeming production gives us a glittering vision of the future (think "Logan's Run" on a modern budget). In the end, the film is more a tasty morsel than a satisfying meal--it may slip right out of your consciousness a day after you've seen it--but the misfits-as-rebels angle and the suave star-turns by Theron, Sophie Okonedo (as ever-faithful Sithandra, who has hands for feet) and handsome Marton Csokas (as Trevor Goodchild, who puts all the pieces in place) help make this an enjoyable ride. **1/2 from ****

If you're a fan of the original series, do NOT see this movie.I should have been skeptical from the previews when Aeon expresses her motives for murder. In the series Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests. Obviously the chimp-writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the "bad grrl" demographic by making the character deadly, but have a good reason to kill people.You wouldn't have thought it possible, but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved. All dogs go to heaven, and same for every character that dies in this movie.The selfish,twisted,perverted, dominating personas of Aeon and Trevor are nowhere to be seen. In the end they literally develop into a cutesy couple ala Annie Hall. The only character who remained true to the show was the Relicle, the floating machine in the sky. I suppose if you ever thought "gee, I like Aeon Flux, but I wish it were more like every other faceless good-v-evil sci-fi Hollywood slop out there", then you are in for a treat.They didn't even get the look right. I suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for, but the whole setting is wrong. 400 years into the future sure looks like 30 years into the past. Instead of a distinctly urban post-apocalyptic world, the viewer's eyes are offended with a 70's mod-squad frutopia of egg-shaped furniture, wood paneled walls, earth tones, and lots of plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia.Speaking of Bregna, that's the only city on earth according to the movie. The show is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, which used to be one. In the movie, the "Monicans" are just Hollywood storybook freedom-fighters. They also have as much technology as the Bregnans, which is not the case from the show.The only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this movie was a high school kid, and that he wrote it the day before it was due to the studio execs, and he's never seen an entire Aeon Flux all the way through. The overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the cartoon is baffling. Beyond using certain names like Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild, and Bregna, the movie is nothing like the show.The actual bulk of the movie seems to try to blend the colorful plots of soy-lent green, blade runner, Logan's run, and tomb raider, which came out a dull brown mess.

I decided I had to watch this film when the reviewer I listen to said that other reviewers who said it was the worst film of the year were mistaken... he also mentioned Charlize Theron's costume but my wanting to watch the film had nothing to do with that... honest! I'm glad I decided to give it a go as it was a lot of fun even though it is rather silly. The action was fun to watch and the acting wasn't bad.Set in a future where most of the population has died and only one city of healthy people remains Charlize Theron plays the eponymous Æon Flux, a rebel fighting against the city's government. When her innocent sister is killed by government forces she assumes it is because of her own involvement with the rebels. When she is given a mission to infiltrate the government zone and assassinate its leader she takes it hoping to get revenge on those responsible for her sister's death. However when she has her target in her sights she does not take the shot; having a strange feeling that she knows him even though they have never met. She soon learns that her world is not as it seems and she must battle against both government forces and her own people to protect her erstwhile target and uncover the truth.The film is a bit let down by the writing but the special effects and the acting were both pretty good especially Charlize Theron. I particularly liked the garden that contained plants that attacked people. I never saw the animated television series so can't say how it compares but as a stand alone film it is good mindless fun which knows it isn't anything serious.

The MTV sci-fi animated series "Æon Flux" is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. For her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the film was a little dull. A lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all. It may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best. I have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so I can't compare the two. It's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. The film is not that confusing but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. The acting was alright, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also give decent performances including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including Sithandra, Aeon's friend.The problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself too seriously. It carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring. There's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the film is so serious, the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good but that's not what the film is really about so don't go in expecting just an action movie. The twist at the end isn't mind blowing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting. The visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice. So, the movie may be a case of style over substance. Interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time. In the end, it's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental. Rating 4/10

I just got back from seeing the movie. A person could write almost 2 reviews for this movie. One designed for those who have seen Peter Chung's shorts and series, and one designed for those who know nothing about it.For those who have seen the original animation: There is good news and bad. The good news being that this movie takes after the animation very little. I for one feel that the style, environment, and dialogue captured in the animated series is one best left for a medium that is more malleable than Hollywood. I refuse to believe that an animated Aeon Flux would have ever translated well with Peter Chung's vision 100% intact, and thankfully, this movie does not really make an attempt. To do so would have been campy, over-the-top, and completely disassociated fluff. Sure, there are select scenes that you can equate between the movie and animation, character names are familiar, and even some of the technology, but for the most part this is a decent example of a film that was inspired by the work of Peter Chung's animation, and NOT a film based directly from it. In short, the best way to approach this movie is with the state of mind that it is an above-average sci-fi movie with characters that simply coincidentally share names with those in Peter Chung's work. The bad news being that this movie takes after the animation very little. If you are the kind of person who is very much into Peter Chung's work, as I am, then this movie may disappoint in some areas. Charlize Theron, while playing the role capably, is missing some of the socio-philosophical demeanor that trademarks the original Aeon. The plot itself, while entertaining, is nothing that leaves you scratching your head and wondering "What the hell" as the series did.For those who have never seen the original animation: Aeon Flux is a very stylish, action packed sci-fi movie with plenty of flash and glamour. The "technology" of the movie is rather unbelievable in some parts. However it's good to see a movie that takes risks by creating a world where, much as life 400years in the future will probably be, is unrecognizable to anything we presently associate with. Yet the world created in Aeon Flux is sometimes unbalanced. One moment you are gazing at bizarre biotechnology and inconceivable communications devices, and the next you are staring down the barrel of a very conventional gun. The characters themselves are interesting and, for the most part, well acted. The dialogue seems a little surreal at times, but again, this can be dismissed by the idea that our minds cannot possibly grasp this world 400 years in the future. Or perhaps I'm making excuses for the movie? Regardless, no matter how strange the events, dialogue, or scenery is, it seems to fit together well as a bundle. Suspension of disbelief is done fairly well in this movie even if you have to help it along at points. The plot has enough intrigue and twists to keep you guessing who the "bad guys" really are, while at the same time, you are left asking yourself if there are any "good guys" at all. In that regard, the duality and uncertainty of people, their agendas, and their goals reminds me very much of the original animation. The action sequences themselves are nice, and while there is complicated martial arts action, it never really seems as showboating - it's all very effective and rarely superfluous.Overall, I'd give it a very conservative 6.5, which for those of you who know me, is a decent score as I am a fairly harsh critic. It's a movie I'd see again, but not want to pay full price for the second time through.

I think Hollywood has run out of their one idea on how to make an action movie with a female lead. It became an unwritten rule somewhere along the line that the heroine must scowl, sulk and be generally unhappy throughout the film. Elektra was really the worst with this. Jennifer Garner (who I really like otherwise) was just laughable with her constant dour, angry, "I'm really, really serious" expression. Charlize isn't quite that bad in Aeon Flux but she comes close.I'm thinking that Theron is not the problem here. She's a damn good actress and could have easily served up a serious-yet-witty heroine. No, I'm guessing the director or the script (or both) demanded it.The fight choreography didn't exist. Kusama used the Hollywood favorite of editing in lieu of actual martial choreography. So, you end up with the same old choppy fight scenes. That's boring.The shoot-outs were fun though. I particularly enjoyed the one near the end with the Monicans on the towers.Some pros: The movie did have it's fun moments. The story serviced the pacing fairly well. Theron also cut a nice figure in her Aeon outfit.For a fun comparison watch Aeon Flux, Ultraviolet, Bloodrayne and Underworld together.

Or, at least, that's what it felt like at many points in the film. At others I was traumatized by the horrid spectre of "Cleopatra 2525", "The Island" and any number of other sub-par sci-fi movies of recent, and not-so-recent years.To be fair, the first third of the movie is the worst. After that it becomes bearable, but those first 30 minutes or so are hard work. The rebels (who one presumes wish to avoid attention) prance around in long leather coats whilst everyone else is dressed normally. Later, Aeon ditches this look to wear a bright white bodysuit. Hardly inconspicuous.And what's with the technology? We learn that, for the past 400 years, people have just been cloned because humanity is infertile. And for all those years, they've been working on a cure, only discovered as the story opens. OK, so they can't cure infertility, but they have managed to invent message pills, have hands transplanted to where you should have feet and generally improved the human physique to be able to perform superhuman feats of strength, balance and speed. What's wrong with this picture? How dense do they think the viewers really are? Other questions arise, such as "What happens to Goodchild every time he is reborn?" Does he get plucked away from anonymous parents in the night to be raised as leader all over again? Am I the only person to notice these glaring plot craters? More answers are needed to make this a complete world, but the movie only provides more questions and precious few (and only the obvious, already guessed) answers.Given some of the reviews here, I'm not even sure if having seen the series would have helped much. The movie seems to be little like the show (good old Hollywood!).In the end, I was just glad it was over.

'Aeon Flux' is visually and stylistically dazzling. The CGI and set designs look great and the the futuristic world that is presented is impressive. I haven't watched the original but having read other comments I would like to watch that. However, regarding this movie, it is the screenplay that is a big letdown. It is very obviously predictable and contrived. It lacks depth. It's more like just another forgettable Hollywood entertainer. Some scenes seem to be there only to show the special effects (which are great) and stunts as they don't seem to have any relevance for the main plot.In my opinion, the love story is the weakest link. It's very unconvincing and the 'romantic' lead lack chemistry. Furthermore, apart from Theron, McDormand, Okonedo and Postlethwaite, the acting is terrible. Theron looks the part and acts well. She is beautiful but deadly. She does a lot of crawling around and arse kicking but manages to stay in character and looks absolutely sizzling. Okonedo doesn't have a great role to speak of but she does well. McDormand and Postlethwaite are effective in their small roles. Miller is very bad and Csokas is wooden.Having said that, I'd say it's not a horrendous film. Just something to watch if you don't have anything better. I really enjoyed the visuals and the style and of course just looking at the beautiful Theron. Other than that, the plot might appeal to the average movie watcher if they want something with no depth, but just an action, sci-fi, romantic flick.

I should have marked this as a spoiler just from the summary. If you expected anything more from this movie I just ruined it for you. If you've ever seen A Day Without a Mexican and thought it cunning and thought provoking, this is your type of movie.There were so many failures on so many levels I honestly don't know where to begin. There was no character development and thus no emotion which results in nothing to keep you watching unless you want to see what type of outfit Charlize will be wearing in the next 500 3 second cuts.Maybe I'm alone in that I like a movie where I at least know WHERE things are taking place, how they are happening, who these people are that they're happening to, and above all why things are blowing up and people are dying, but then again maybe not.I really see no reason why anyone would want to watch this movie unless you've got some obsession with one of the actors in the movie and you really don't care about anything else.

I tried my best to avoid this movie purely from what i saw in the trailer being a avid fan of the "Original" series where there was no dialogue as well as the Series where plot took more precedence....... but i indulged figuring if nothing else 7$ would be worth the eye candy First things first....The casting director is shooting in the dark as far as I'm concerned Why would they not make Jonny Lee Miller "Trevor" i think both look-wise "Hackers" for instance (looks waaaay more like Goodchild in the series)and acting ability alone he was the perfect candidate and the fact that he was even in this movie and not Trevor but his lamebrain brother who they fabricated out of mid-air is a insult whoever did the casting for the film obviously hasn't seen or respected the series I'm not even going to go into Aeon as anyone who knows... there are a insane amount of flaws about her.. I feel Theron took the role for the $$ Second... one of my favorite things about the actual series not the shorts were the monologues of Trevor's giving him method to his madness and the metaphors that lied within the series itself not to mention the sexual tension of Aeon who was a actual Dominatrix in the series and Trevor... a cat and mouse game of tease tag if you will they both had power just in different facets and Chung really played with that idea in a genius way if you ask me this film is utter spoon-fed trite digestible for the "Matrix" generation Adding proper names to characters does not justify completely rewriting and abusing a series of exceptional quality the likes that come along once in a blue moon in the watered down age /rant

For those people already familiar with the animated series please forgive me for giving a brief introduction to those people who have not experienced Aeon Flux before.
The franchise is based in a future world, and the series focused on Aeon and her arch nemesis/love-of-her-life Trevor Goodchild who is the leader/dictator of this future world. The series was very much a freaky, psychedelic, mind-bending collection of odd stories, some of which the plot is verging on impossible to follow closely. Thankfully the film, in an attempt to become more mainstream has gone for a easier-to-follow more Americanized plot, so if you're hoping for more from the giant baby from the series or the creatures that make mind-erasing pills then you may be disappointed. That is not to say that the film is not without its odd gadgets or odd scenes, such as the conversations that Aeon has inside her mind with her boss, or the woman with hands for feet.For those people already familiar with the animated series please forgive me for giving a brief introduction to those people who have not experienced Aeon Flux before.

Thank fully the film, in an attempt to become more mainstream has gone for a easier-to-follow more Americanized plot, so if you're hoping for more from the giant baby from the series or the creatures that make mind-erasing pills then you may be disappointed. That is not to say that the film is not without its odd gadgets or odd scenes, such as the conversations that Aeon has inside her mind with her boss, or the woman with hands for feet (also featured in the series) but the extent of the "oddness" has been greatly diminished. Die-hard fans of the series will notice certain similarities or homages to the shorts and episodes, such as transferring a message in a kiss, or as I mentioned above certain characters, but even so the film does act a stand-alone piece and no prior knowledge is needed to understand or follow the plot.Probably the film's strongest asset is the plot. To begin with it may seem very similar to the millions of other future-world films out there, but once the plot has been fully revealed it makes for a very interesting film, investigating grounds I have not seen any other films touch upon before. I won't say anymore with regards to the plot as I may give-away something that could ruin it, but let me just say that if you do like this area of cinema and are looking for something a little different, buy it now!
Otherwise nothing else in the film is of massive merit or poses any cause-for-concern, the acting is good, the music and sound effects are fine, the stunts are nothing amazingly new, but are adequate and the locales and settings are believable and well-constructed.
If it sounds like your sort of film so far then you will find its freshness welcome in a somewhat stagnant pool of dictator/future/sci-fi/post-apocalyptic films. For those who are fans of the series again it is well-worth a look, it doesn't fit in continuity with the series in any place but serves as both a good introduction and final conclusion to the series. And for those people who don't fit into either of the above categories it can serve as gentle introduction to this area of cinema, or however could sour you to any further films of this genre in the future. So I guess for you its your choice good film....!

Sure, the story line is a little weak. But in the midst of a movie industry that can't seem to release a solid plot that doesn't seem like it was ripped off from the last two hundred movies the studio has released, even a mediocre script can be turned into a good movie, if the other elements were there. In this movie's case, they were. It had action that was well done. It had special effects that were gripping. It had a neat idea for the base of it's story. And even better, it Charlize Theron and Sophie Okonedo dressed in great outfits and bending their bodies in every-which way.What it boils down to, if you like Sci-Fi, and you like Charlize, and even better, if you like the old cartoon, it's at least worth a watch.

I had seen the cartoon on MTV and had been fairly unimpressed, so when I heard they were making a film version I had fairly low expectations for the outcome. I had a quiet Saturday night so when the offer to go see it I thought what harm would it do. Bad idea, what an awful film! I got the impression they were still writing the script when they started making the film, because there are so many ideas being thrown around but not one of them is followed, I was lost and bored before the end of the first hour so much so that when they finally unravelled the mystery I really didn't care.Other people have said its abstract and unique, but it wasn't. This is yet another example of the cliché-ridden, weakly plotted rubbish made by people with delusions of grandeur.

The Movie as it is alright if you expect just what i have expected. A stereotype action/special effect movie. Good fighting scenes and great special effects. BUT, honestly, this has nothing to do with the animated series. Well, yes, there are the technical gizmo's. And yes, there was some sort of love/hate relationship between Aeon and Trevor. Also there were clones in both, the series and the Movie (with one big difference, the idea of cloning was very much perverted using clones also as sex-toys. But thats about it. Trevor Goodkind a GOOD GUY? Maybe i am over-stressing the animated series, but i saw many philosophical implications in the series, totally lacking in the Movie.The society in the city was a parted one and not this "everything is just fine" utopia like in the movie (Aeon entered the upper class part with an absolutely marvelous vehicle - totally missing in the Movie). The whole point about the animated series was the gray shade of both, the government and the rebels. There was no "good side". Both killed for their own goals, never revealed to the audience. In the movie you get your evil guy you can hate. Easy but unsatisfying. Both sides had their traitors, blurring the rest of a real difference between them.The conflict between the rebels and the government was a futile struggle like in Orwell's 1984 (seen in a very good episode of the animated series, where the balance of power constantly changed between the government army and the rebels). The conflict existed for no reason but for the conflict itself. Therefore the element of luck was so important. The fact if you live or die depended on sheer coincidental factors (the "Nail"-scene in the animated series).The "caligulesk" absolute ruler called Trevor Goodkind like in Hobbes's Leviathan was also missing. In the animated series Trevor had it all, leaving his live an escapade of sick games and lusts to fill his emptiness which only Aeon could fill. In the movie he is just a monarch, debating with his "servants".Summed up, just watch this movie for itself, but you will be disappointed if you expect anything "deep" in the movie.Please forgive my poor English and the typos hence i am a native German guy ;-)

It's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release. That many movies suck is no surprise, but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time, the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sorts. Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hollywood, then, that "Aeon Flux" isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect, given the above. Though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws, it at least has (sort of) an idea with which to toy around. Too bad director Karyn Kusama seems to have little clue how to execute it all.It's the future. There's been a plague. There is a dictatorship, and there are rebels. The latter are known as the Monicans, and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshipers, they're into attempts to overthrow the former, called the Goodchild regime. The regime is occasionally mean to the citizenry, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and her pals can stand. Through some sort of biochemical virtual reality technology, the Monicans receive orders from their dear leader (Frances McDormand), a mystical priestess-type who appears to have been cross-bred with a carrot. It falls to Aeon to strap on some form-fitting, futuristic spandex get-ups to carry out the High Carrot's orders, which are of course some version of "destroy the regime." Having years earlier watched her sister get liquidated by the Goodchilds, she needs little convincing.Not surprisingly, things get complicated. The Goodchilds might not be quite what they seem, and Aeon herself might have an unexpected history with them. Though occasionally muddled, the film's central conceit (of which I won't reveal more) contains some neat notions about the nature of human existence and survival. There's room for much more examination of which the film doesn't take advantage, but the ideas are there, at least. The big problems of "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama has made the baffling decision to film nearly all the action so close that we can rarely follow what's going on. To make matters worse, it's edited in a flurry of jump cuts that leave us completely lost. The result is some serious spacial disorientation that takes over the film. "Aeon Flux"'s aesthetic is one of sleek costume, oddly-angled architecture, and nimble characters. Much of the action occurs in minimalist, open spaces that beg for some unbroken long shots that might convey the grace and athleticism implied by the above. Instead, we get split seconds of flying limbs, breaking glass, and accompanying sound effects.There is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the morass of "Aeon Flux." Put this stuff in the hands of the Wachowski brothers, say, and the results could be quite different. As it is, though, I felt like "Aeon Flux" was willfully pushing me away from a movie I wanted to enjoy. This film is unattuned to its own strengths. Like a novice poker player dealt a royal flush, it somehow finds a way to lose in spite of its potential.

Charlize Theron cuts an exceptionally striking presence as the heroine of this smashing action-oriented fantasy involving a rebel fighter in 2415 whose assignment is to kill the leader of a totalitarian regime; turns out, she recognizes him as a man who once meant a great deal to her and finds she can't eliminate him (nor vice-versa), precipitating a coupe amongst his people. Though exceptionally flashy, this MTV production (based upon their animated series) has its roots steeped in the past, with a plot that admittedly recalls dozens of enemy-for-the-people adventures. Despite some intentionally amusing asides, the dialogue is fairly stilted (though there isn't much of it, which is ultimately a plus) and the editing is occasionally sharp though it eliminates things we should be seeing to clarify the narrative (like how Æon Flux manages to climb aboard and exit a flying monument). Frances McDormand's role as Theron's boss is left a bit sketchy (who does she get her orders from?) and her reluctance to give Æon even the slightest benefit of the doubt is perplexing. The action sequences are elaborately, entertainingly staged, and the crisp, expensive-seeming production gives us a glittering vision of the future (think "Logan's Run" on a modern budget). In the end, the film is more a tasty morsel than a satisfying meal--it may slip right out of your consciousness a day after you've seen it--but the misfits-as-rebels angle and the suave star-turns by Theron, Sophie Okonedo (as ever-faithful Sithandra, who has hands for feet) and handsome Marton Csokas (as Trevor Goodchild, who puts all the pieces in place) help make this an enjoyable ride. **1/2 from ****

When I originally heard of Aeon Flux, it sounded absolutely terrible. The posters looked even worse. However, after seeing a trailer somewhere, I loved the look and bright colours (being easily pleased) and decided to give the movie a chance. Aeon Flux is the story of a female, barely clothed rebel sent in to assassinate the ruler of a dystopian isolated city, which contains the entire remainder of mankind. Let's just say the plot is entirely unoriginal, a derivative of many other Sci-Fi movies and stories. Charlieze Theron gets to prance around with an insect-like walk (her first appearance strongly reminded me of a praying mantis), salamander-like crawls, and other, animal-inspired, ballet-like movements. The world of Aeon Flux is drawn in bright, almost psychedelic colours, and it feels as if we glimpse only the tiniest part of this strange place. A lake of tears acts as CCTV for the entire city, pills exchanged in French kisses are used for telepathy, little pellets of liquid metal have a will of their own... A good chunk of the film is dazzling to watch, without any explanation behind it. Strictly speaking, Aeon Flux is about 80% futuristic fantasy, with very little science fiction in it. In fact, it sometimes feels as if the strangely organic gadgets of the rebels do not fit in this world - as the authorities seem to have more conventional technology and weapons. What Aeon Flux succeeds at the most is dazzling the audience. Visually, stylistically, and with its energy and futuristic fantasy (and constantly underdressed heroine). In that, it reminds me strongly of Fifth Element - another film where we feel as if we only get a glimpse of a futuristic, colourful world full of strangely dressed people, without the need to explain or expose every aspect of it. However, Aeon Flux is less satisfying than Luc Besson's classic - because it lacks a sense of humour and takes itself too seriously (which, given the plot, is a bad move).All in all, I would recommend the film to people who enjoy Fifth Element, bright colours, a sense of visual alienation, and unoriginal science fiction dressed up in a bright, original and almost unique coating.

If you're a fan of the original series, do NOT see this movie.I should have been skeptical from the previews when Aeon expresses her motives for murder. In the series Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests. Obviously the chimp-writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the "bad grrl" demographic by making the character deadly, but have a good reason to kill people.You wouldn't have thought it possible, but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved. All dogs go to heaven, and same for every character that dies in this movie.The selfish,twisted,perverted, dominating personas of Aeon and Trevor are nowhere to be seen. In the end they literally develop into a cutesy couple ala Annie Hall. The only character who remained true to the show was the Relicle, the floating machine in the sky. I suppose if you ever thought "gee, I like Aeon Flux, but I wish it were more like every other faceless good-v-evil sci-fi Hollywood slop out there", then you are in for a treat.They didn't even get the look right. I suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for, but the whole setting is wrong. 400 years into the future sure looks like 30 years into the past. Instead of a distinctly urban post-apocalyptic world, the viewer's eyes are offended with a 70's mod-squad frutopia of egg-shaped furniture, wood paneled walls, earth tones, and lots of plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia.Speaking of Bregna, that's the only city on earth according to the movie. The show is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, which used to be one. In the movie, the "Monicans" are just Hollywood storybook freedom-fighters. They also have as much technology as the Bregnans, which is not the case from the show.The only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this movie was a high school kid, and that he wrote it the day before it was due to the studio execs, and he's never seen an entire Aeon Flux all the way through. The overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the cartoon is baffling. Beyond using certain names like Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild, and Bregna, the movie is nothing like the show.The actual bulk of the movie seems to try to blend the colorful plots of soy-lent green, blade runner, Logan's run, and tomb raider, which came out a dull brown mess.

I decided I had to watch this film when the reviewer I listen to said that other reviewers who said it was the worst film of the year were mistaken... he also mentioned Charlize Theron's costume but my wanting to watch the film had nothing to do with that... honest! I'm glad I decided to give it a go as it was a lot of fun even though it is rather silly. The action was fun to watch and the acting wasn't bad.Set in a future where most of the population has died and only one city of healthy people remains Charlize Theron plays the eponymous Æon Flux, a rebel fighting against the city's government. When her innocent sister is killed by government forces she assumes it is because of her own involvement with the rebels. When she is given a mission to infiltrate the government zone and assassinate its leader she takes it hoping to get revenge on those responsible for her sister's death. However when she has her target in her sights she does not take the shot; having a strange feeling that she knows him even though they have never met. She soon learns that her world is not as it seems and she must battle against both government forces and her own people to protect her erstwhile target and uncover the truth.The film is a bit let down by the writing but the special effects and the acting were both pretty good especially Charlize Theron. I particularly liked the garden that contained plants that attacked people. I never saw the animated television series so can't say how it compares but as a stand alone film it is good mindless fun which knows it isn't anything serious.

The MTV sci-fi animated series "Æon Flux" is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. For her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the film was a little dull. A lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all. It may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best. I have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so I can't compare the two. It's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. The film is not that confusing but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. The acting was alright, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also give decent performances including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including Sithandra, Aeon's friend.The problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself too seriously. It carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring. There's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the film is so serious, the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good but that's not what the film is really about so don't go in expecting just an action movie. The twist at the end isn't mind blowing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting. The visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice. So, the movie may be a case of style over substance. Interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time. In the end, it's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental. Rating 4/10

I just got back from seeing the movie. A person could write almost 2 reviews for this movie. One designed for those who have seen Peter Chung's shorts and series, and one designed for those who know nothing about it.For those who have seen the original animation: There is good news and bad. The good news being that this movie takes after the animation very little. I for one feel that the style, environment, and dialogue captured in the animated series is one best left for a medium that is more malleable than Hollywood. I refuse to believe that an animated Aeon Flux would have ever translated well with Peter Chung's vision 100% intact, and thankfully, this movie does not really make an attempt. To do so would have been campy, over-the-top, and completely disassociated fluff. Sure, there are select scenes that you can equate between the movie and animation, character names are familiar, and even some of the technology, but for the most part this is a decent example of a film that was inspired by the work of Peter Chung's animation, and NOT a film based directly from it. In short, the best way to approach this movie is with the state of mind that it is an above-average sci-fi movie with characters that simply coincidentally share names with those in Peter Chung's work. The bad news being that this movie takes after the animation very little. If you are the kind of person who is very much into Peter Chung's work, as I am, then this movie may disappoint in some areas. Charlize Theron, while playing the role capably, is missing some of the socio-philosophical demeanor that trademarks the original Aeon. The plot itself, while entertaining, is nothing that leaves you scratching your head and wondering "What the hell" as the series did.For those who have never seen the original animation: Aeon Flux is a very stylish, action packed sci-fi movie with plenty of flash and glamour. The "technology" of the movie is rather unbelievable in some parts. However it's good to see a movie that takes risks by creating a world where, much as life 400years in the future will probably be, is unrecognizable to anything we presently associate with. Yet the world created in Aeon Flux is sometimes unbalanced. One moment you are gazing at bizarre biotechnology and inconceivable communications devices, and the next you are staring down the barrel of a very conventional gun. The characters themselves are interesting and, for the most part, well acted. The dialogue seems a little surreal at times, but again, this can be dismissed by the idea that our minds cannot possibly grasp this world 400 years in the future. Or perhaps I'm making excuses for the movie? Regardless, no matter how strange the events, dialogue, or scenery is, it seems to fit together well as a bundle. Suspension of disbelief is done fairly well in this movie even if you have to help it along at points. The plot has enough intrigue and twists to keep you guessing who the "bad guys" really are, while at the same time, you are left asking yourself if there are any "good guys" at all. In that regard, the duality and uncertainty of people, their agendas, and their goals reminds me very much of the original animation. The action sequences themselves are nice, and while there is complicated martial arts action, it never really seems as showboating - it's all very effective and rarely superfluous.Overall, I'd give it a very conservative 6.5, which for those of you who know me, is a decent score as I am a fairly harsh critic. It's a movie I'd see again, but not want to pay full price for the second time through.

In the animated series: Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, untamable, ambiguous all at once. The original Aeon had layers upon layers of depth. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking. You could never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist whereas Trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship.In the movie:Aeon Flux works for the Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tamable, emotional and very predictable. The Aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most. The plot was obvious and contrived. Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides.The movie was a horrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time, squeezed all the depth and personality out of her, and pumped her full of Hollywood clichés. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie. The only reason I'm not giving this movie a "1" is because the visuals were incredible. It was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with CGI.

This film is vastly underrated to me. The highlight is the visual design and imagination that it borrows from its source material. For sure, the story has been turned into a more conventional Hollywood plot, but it makes up for that with smooth action scenes, acrobatic stunts and imaginative gadgets.

I think Hollywood has run out of their one idea on how to make an action movie with a female lead. It became an unwritten rule somewhere along the line that the heroine must scowl, sulk and be generally unhappy throughout the film. Elektra was really the worst with this. Jennifer Garner (who I really like otherwise) was just laughable with her constant dour, angry, "I'm really, really serious" expression. Charlize isn't quite that bad in Aeon Flux but she comes close.I'm thinking that Theron is not the problem here. She's a damn good actress and could have easily served up a serious-yet-witty heroine. No, I'm guessing the director or the script (or both) demanded it.The fight choreography didn't exist. Kusama used the Hollywood favorite of editing in lieu of actual martial choreography. So, you end up with the same old choppy fight scenes. That's boring.The shoot-outs were fun though. I particularly enjoyed the one near the end with the Monicans on the towers.Some pros: The movie did have it's fun moments. The story serviced the pacing fairly well. Theron also cut a nice figure in her Aeon outfit.For a fun comparison watch Aeon Flux, Ultraviolet, Bloodrayne and Underworld together.

We just got home from seeing Aeon Flux, and for my money, it turned out to be far better than I had expected. Ready for an action movie with lots of leaping, jumping and hero stuff, it was all of that - but more. It actually had a story line! And it was that story line that kept things moving nicely along.I think that it's relatively short length (97 minutes) also helped it from being bogged down with minutiae and having a plot that had to be mercilessly stretched beyond its limits. The scenes were crisply photographed, the special effects were enough to give the film its character WITHOUT making it a special-effects movie, per se.Although a little thin in some parts, the dialogue was fair. The only thing I thought might have made it better was the development of some of the peripheral characters.Charlize Theron is very versatile, and now I fully intend to see the anime of Aeon Flux.

The visuals in this movie are just stunning. Charlize Theron is incredibly gorgeous, and the color palette overall is very warm, offsetting the sterility of the walled city. The scenes on the spires and the sky-ship are knockouts.The source material is very obtuse, and so is most of this flick. I really liked the story as it gradually developed, and we came to see the reality of what was going on. It does require the viewer to hang in there until everything is explained, but the ride is definitely worth it. It is a throwback to somewhat kitschy sci-fi from the 60s and 70s; its progenitors are (obviously) "Barbarella"/1968; (sets and costumes) "Fahrenheit 451"/1966; and (themes)"Zardoz"/1974.Destined to be a cult favorite, and will make a TON of money on DVD, trust me.

Or, at least, that's what it felt like at many points in the film. At others I was traumatized by the horrid spectre of "Cleopatra 2525", "The Island" and any number of other sub-par sci-fi movies of recent, and not-so-recent years.To be fair, the first third of the movie is the worst. After that it becomes bearable, but those first 30 minutes or so are hard work. The rebels (who one presumes wish to avoid attention) prance around in long leather coats whilst everyone else is dressed normally. Later, Aeon ditches this look to wear a bright white bodysuit. Hardly inconspicuous.And what's with the technology? We learn that, for the past 400 years, people have just been cloned because humanity is infertile. And for all those years, they've been working on a cure, only discovered as the story opens. OK, so they can't cure infertility, but they have managed to invent message pills, have hands transplanted to where you should have feet and generally improved the human physique to be able to perform superhuman feats of strength, balance and speed. What's wrong with this picture? How dense do they think the viewers really are? Other questions arise, such as "What happens to Goodchild every time he is reborn?" Does he get plucked away from anonymous parents in the night to be raised as leader all over again? Am I the only person to notice these glaring plot craters? More answers are needed to make this a complete world, but the movie only provides more questions and precious few (and only the obvious, already guessed) answers.Given some of the reviews here, I'm not even sure if having seen the series would have helped much. The movie seems to be little like the show (good old Hollywood!).In the end, I was just glad it was over.

'Aeon Flux' is visually and stylistically dazzling. The CGI and set designs look great and the the futuristic world that is presented is impressive. I haven't watched the original but having read other comments I would like to watch that. However, regarding this movie, it is the screenplay that is a big letdown. It is very obviously predictable and contrived. It lacks depth. It's more like just another forgettable Hollywood entertainer. Some scenes seem to be there only to show the special effects (which are great) and stunts as they don't seem to have any relevance for the main plot.In my opinion, the love story is the weakest link. It's very unconvincing and the 'romantic' lead lack chemistry. Furthermore, apart from Theron, McDormand, Okonedo and Postlethwaite, the acting is terrible. Theron looks the part and acts well. She is beautiful but deadly. She does a lot of crawling around and arse kicking but manages to stay in character and looks absolutely sizzling. Okonedo doesn't have a great role to speak of but she does well. McDormand and Postlethwaite are effective in their small roles. Miller is very bad and Csokas is wooden.Having said that, I'd say it's not a horrendous film. Just something to watch if you don't have anything better. I really enjoyed the visuals and the style and of course just looking at the beautiful Theron. Other than that, the plot might appeal to the average movie watcher if they want something with no depth, but just an action, sci-fi, romantic flick.

I should have marked this as a spoiler just from the summary. If you expected anything more from this movie I just ruined it for you. If you've ever seen A Day Without a Mexican and thought it cunning and thought provoking, this is your type of movie.There were so many failures on so many levels I honestly don't know where to begin. There was no character development and thus no emotion which results in nothing to keep you watching unless you want to see what type of outfit Charlize will be wearing in the next 500 3 second cuts.Maybe I'm alone in that I like a movie where I at least know WHERE things are taking place, how they are happening, who these people are that they're happening to, and above all why things are blowing up and people are dying, but then again maybe not.I really see no reason why anyone would want to watch this movie unless you've got some obsession with one of the actors in the movie and you really don't care about anything else.

''Æon Flux '' is not a bad movie, but sure is very different from the animation that made success all over the world. To be honest, to enjoy this movie you need to see it as an ordinary sci-fi film, and not the Æon Flux 's story adapted to the screens. People are complaining about Charlize Theron being casted as Aeon Flux, but I think the original actress they wanted to play Aeon, Michelle Rodriguez, would be a much worst choice! (And Charlize, to be honest, is much cuter then the real Aeon)There are many differences from the animation to this movie. In the animation,Aeon is killed in every episode and then she is OK again in the next one , Trevor is blond and a kind of scary guy, and even Aeon's outfit is different. But I like the way the movie used the cloning method, and even knowing that there isn't a "genetic memory", is nice to see the citizens confused by their other lives. The end of this movie is very positive too, showing to the humans that there is another chance to make things work again. :)

Laughable.Clichéd.Overdoses on style to compensate for poor writing.Remember when MTV actually used to air music videos and other shows besides Reality Shows? Aeon Flux (2005) is based upon one such show  a cartoon from the mid-90s  featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing. Aeon, played by the lovely Charlize Theron in this adaptation, is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a line-dancer and as deadly as a viper-snake. She needs to be, if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian government.I love science fiction, but hate the sudden influx of half-assed futuristic dystopian technology-overdosed films like The Island (2005) and Equilibrium (2002) (bottom of the pile). Aeon Flux has all the problems that are present in these films, but amplified. That is, there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that Matrix (1999) catalyzed. The special effects are therefore sensational in Aeon Flux which earns it a few points, but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there.To make matters worse, all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch. Charlize Theron's character Aeon Flux is interwoven with the most cheesy tough-chick schtick and it seems as though the director Karyn Kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next  should she make her more detached or more emotional? She doesn't know! Let's go both ways! Imagine you take a shotgun, load it chock-full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess. This is the character of Aeon Flux.The film Aeon Flux puts forward all the 'mandatory' ideas in a dystopian society - individual vs. society, nature vs. science, emotion vs. cold reason, etc. You've seen all of this before, and better done at that. Go read Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley, or even watch Logan's Run (1976) or Blade Runner (1982)... anything! Avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese-fest for as long as you can.3/10

I'll probably be hammered for this but I thought the screen play was relatively good one considering it was adapted from an animated series. Sure hard core fans (like myself) will find lots to pick and fuss about but overall it was a nice addition to the mythology, filling in certain gaps, and faithfulness to the original ethos, tech and internecine machinations of Trevor and AEon and of the original series. The CG effects were well done and it was a real hoot to see Aeon and her four handed friend navigate through defenses. It was just like a scene out of the original.The acting as not exactly above par and a lot could have been done to use the character development of the main protagonists in the original series as a jumping off point. The director or screen play writers appeared to be a little hesitant to use the preexisting knowledge for fear of alienating movie goers who were coming to the characters for the first time. More work needed to be done to integrate the already existing pool of knowledge into the first movie without overwhelming or confusing new viewers (Dune had the opposite problem so there surely is a happy middle ground to be found if you put your mind to it). Come on screen writers do some home work and earn your salaries. This is too good a series to let it possibly flop on the first of a possibly lucrative franchise!

I tried my best to avoid this movie purely from what i saw in the trailer being a avid fan of the "Original" series where there was no dialogue as well as the Series where plot took more precedence....... but i indulged figuring if nothing else 7$ would be worth the eye candy First things first....The casting director is shooting in the dark as far as I'm concerned Why would they not make Jonny Lee Miller "Trevor" i think both look-wise "Hackers" for instance (looks waaaay more like Goodchild in the series)and acting ability alone he was the perfect candidate and the fact that he was even in this movie and not Trevor but his lamebrain brother who they fabricated out of mid-air is a insult whoever did the casting for the film obviously hasn't seen or respected the series I'm not even going to go into Aeon as anyone who knows... there are a insane amount of flaws about her.. I feel Theron took the role for the $$ Second... one of my favorite things about the actual series not the shorts were the monologues of Trevor's giving him method to his madness and the metaphors that lied within the series itself not to mention the sexual tension of Aeon who was a actual Dominatrix in the series and Trevor... a cat and mouse game of tease tag if you will they both had power just in different facets and Chung really played with that idea in a genius way if you ask me this film is utter spoon-fed trite digestible for the "Matrix" generation Adding proper names to characters does not justify completely rewriting and abusing a series of exceptional quality the likes that come along once in a blue moon in the watered down age /rant

What Æon Flux has in spades is style. The original animated series had a very distinct visual style and they have clearly done their best to give the movie an equally vivid visual presence. And I'd say they succeeded. Everything in distant utopia looks great and the film is well worth a watch for the visuals alone.The premise is also pretty interesting. A virus has wiped out most of humanity and now only small pockets survive in the middle of wilderness, protected by high walls and the advancement of technology. Yet they must live under a tight regime, and naturally some elements of society are bound to rebel. Our story follows one such rebel, named Æon, who manages to dig deeper into the mystery than anyone before. And thus the stage is set and the play can begin. Great, innovative stuff that allows for a lot of action.Unfortunately what we end up getting from this setting isn't as great as it could have been. One of the problems is the acting. Charlize Theron is as captivating as ever, but the rest of the cast seem bound by the script and their own limitations. It's a stifling utopia, but does that really have to show in the acting as well.The resolution of the story is also somewhat predictable, or at least unimaginative. The downsides of the utopian society are nothing we haven't seen before, the end moral is boring and as a whole I can only wish the story and the themes had matched the visual splendor.Æon Flux is worth a watch for the fans of the genre. It's gorgeous, action-filled fun, Theron looks amazing in her skimpy dresses and nothing in it is outright bad. Sure, the script could have been better, but on the whole that merely makes it average.

I went into this movie cold, never having seen the MTV series that spawned it. The film completely fails to connect with the viewer. Let's see Aeon's double-life and be treated to some character developing dialogue -- instead, we were thrown headfirst into the action, with no reason whatsoever to care about the outcome. What's more, during the rest of the movie, we're never given a good reason to take one side or another, except for the fact that the villain characters all say villainous things and have apparently villainous motives. The action sequences are not terribly cohesive or believable, either. Overall, there's not much to recommend this movie.

For those people already familiar with the animated series please forgive me for giving a brief introduction to those people who have not experienced Aeon Flux before.
The franchise is based in a future world, and the series focused on Aeon and her arch nemesis/love-of-her-life Trevor Goodchild who is the leader/dictator of this future world. The series was very much a freaky, psychedelic, mind-bending collection of odd stories, some of which the plot is verging on impossible to follow closely. Thankfully the film, in an attempt to become more mainstream has gone for a easier-to-follow more Americanized plot, so if you're hoping for more from the giant baby from the series or the creatures that make mind-erasing pills then you may be disappointed. That is not to say that the film is not without its odd gadgets or odd scenes, such as the conversations that Aeon has inside her mind with her boss, or the woman with hands for feet.For those people already familiar with the animated series please forgive me for giving a brief introduction to those people who have not experienced Aeon Flux before.

Thank fully the film, in an attempt to become more mainstream has gone for a easier-to-follow more Americanized plot, so if you're hoping for more from the giant baby from the series or the creatures that make mind-erasing pills then you may be disappointed. That is not to say that the film is not without its odd gadgets or odd scenes, such as the conversations that Aeon has inside her mind with her boss, or the woman with hands for feet (also featured in the series) but the extent of the "oddness" has been greatly diminished. Die-hard fans of the series will notice certain similarities or homages to the shorts and episodes, such as transferring a message in a kiss, or as I mentioned above certain characters, but even so the film does act a stand-alone piece and no prior knowledge is needed to understand or follow the plot.Probably the film's strongest asset is the plot. To begin with it may seem very similar to the millions of other future-world films out there, but once the plot has been fully revealed it makes for a very interesting film, investigating grounds I have not seen any other films touch upon before. I won't say anymore with regards to the plot as I may give-away something that could ruin it, but let me just say that if you do like this area of cinema and are looking for something a little different, buy it now!
Otherwise nothing else in the film is of massive merit or poses any cause-for-concern, the acting is good, the music and sound effects are fine, the stunts are nothing amazingly new, but are adequate and the locales and settings are believable and well-constructed.
If it sounds like your sort of film so far then you will find its freshness welcome in a somewhat stagnant pool of dictator/future/sci-fi/post-apocalyptic films. For those who are fans of the series again it is well-worth a look, it doesn't fit in continuity with the series in any place but serves as both a good introduction and final conclusion to the series. And for those people who don't fit into either of the above categories it can serve as gentle introduction to this area of cinema, or however could sour you to any further films of this genre in the future. So I guess for you its your choice good film....!

Sure, the story line is a little weak. But in the midst of a movie industry that can't seem to release a solid plot that doesn't seem like it was ripped off from the last two hundred movies the studio has released, even a mediocre script can be turned into a good movie, if the other elements were there. In this movie's case, they were. It had action that was well done. It had special effects that were gripping. It had a neat idea for the base of it's story. And even better, it Charlize Theron and Sophie Okonedo dressed in great outfits and bending their bodies in every-which way.What it boils down to, if you like Sci-Fi, and you like Charlize, and even better, if you like the old cartoon, it's at least worth a watch.

I had seen the cartoon on MTV and had been fairly unimpressed, so when I heard they were making a film version I had fairly low expectations for the outcome. I had a quiet Saturday night so when the offer to go see it I thought what harm would it do. Bad idea, what an awful film! I got the impression they were still writing the script when they started making the film, because there are so many ideas being thrown around but not one of them is followed, I was lost and bored before the end of the first hour so much so that when they finally unravelled the mystery I really didn't care.Other people have said its abstract and unique, but it wasn't. This is yet another example of the cliché-ridden, weakly plotted rubbish made by people with delusions of grandeur.
