I don't know what I expected when I started watching this movie, but I was definitely let down by miles. First of all the dialogue is so bad and cheese, that it sometimes physically hurt to watch. The killing in this movie just takes away from the comedy , and believe me there is loads of killing it. Another negative factor is, that for some unexplainable reason someone thought it was a good idea to make every flame in this movie a bright blue colour, which sometimes really hurts while watching in a dark room. That being said there are some scenes that I found genuinely funny, although most of the time this was unintentional like in action scenes or scenes that where supposed to be serious and dramatic.

Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy), while investigating a car theft ring, comes across something much bigger than that: the same men who shot his boss are running a counterfeit money ring out of a theme park in Los Angeles.This film generally gets a bad rap, being accused of being the worst in the series. Even director John Landis has distanced himself, saying that Murphy was going through a rough time in his life and was not giving it everything he had. These may be fair comments, but the film is still better than given credit for.Maybe not as funny as the first two, and maybe Murphy is more toned down, but there is still plenty of fun here from Bronson Pichot and others... not to mention an overall decent script. Even just trying to identify the director cameos is a fun game.

Watched this for the first time last night, and was pretty disappointed (was on a triple bill with BHC 1 & 2 on Bravo, great way to ring in the New Year!).Not overly funny, the villains were pretty weak, which is odd as John Saxon is usually pretty good as a bad guy, and Tim Carhart was great as Eddie Willows on CSI. Seemed very forced at times, and definitely lacked the Foley-Rosewood-Taggart chemistry that made the first two films so successful. Hector Elizondo is no replacement for John Ashton. The return of Bronson Pinchot as "Serge" was painful to watch.5 out of 10, based more on Eddie Murphy's performance than anything else.

The early 90s were not kind to Eddie Murphy. Paramount butchered Another 48 Hours in the editing room, audiences turned their noses up at Boomerang, and almost nobody even bothered with The Distinguished Gentleman. Eddie had lost his pulling power and decided to go back to the role that made him a superstar. But 1994 just wasn't the right moment as most of the cast and crew were busy, leaving very little in the way of continuity. Several scripts came and went, and what we finally got was a lame 'Die Hard in a Theme Park' story.There is a huge list of reasons why BHC3 stinks:No Taggart. No Bogomil. No Jeffrey. No Harold Faltermeyer. No Bruckheimer/Simpson. No opening title. No wisecracking.Don't get me wrong, I like Hector Elizondo, but he's no substitute for John Ashton (who's absence is explained with a single, flippant line of dialogue). I can't help but think if the above list was shorter then the movie wouldn't have been such a failure. Where on earth did the $70 million budget go? John Landis' action scenes are flat and static, with no real spark or energy.All three Beverly Hills Cop movies have had horrible scripts, huge plot holes, and hammy villains, so I guess in a way it IS in keeping with the tradition. Eddie Murphy gives a very lazy, disinterested performance as Axel Foley, which reminds me a lot of Seagal's effort in Under Siege 2. Neither of them wanted to be there and were phoning it in long distance. This is NOT the Axel you know and love here.It's saved from the gutter by Judge Reinhold's gung-ho as usual Rosewood, and the last minute addition of Axel Fox, a nice touch and the most three-dimensional character in the movie.

You would think that anyone who could do the hilarious Amazon Women on the Moon would be a good director. Sorry, Mr Landis, but you blew it on this one.Maybe it was just one sequel too many, but it fell short of the previous two and is just something to watch if there is absolutely nothing else on TV.Only Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Inspector Todd (Gilbert R. Hill) are back with Axel Foley in this one. Billy is great with Axel, but this film just doesn't have the action of the other two.Theresa Randle provides the eye candy.

This is a terrible, terrible film.The first two in the series were fairly simple, fun films, relying mainly on Eddie Murphy's performances but nevertheless with strong backup from the rest of the cast (particularly in the first one), and a certain eighties 'cool' factor that, while obviously dated, still charms.In this one though, it Eddie Murphy wears a bit thin, and the plot reads like a McBain (of Simpsons fame) film, with its horrific cliches and awful script. Even the music was redone so that only once in the films do we here it in its classic version.And what was going on with Judge Reinhold?I guess Axel Foley just doesn't belong in the 90's.

Beverly Hills Cop III is the worst in what was a promosing action comedy franchise. Murphy was in a carrer slump and I guess he made this film to help out his carrer but it didn't help just sunk it deeper. The film is full of mistakes such as the loss of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckhiemer a weak script and a lack of action. John Landos who worked with Murphy before and made good films fails here. The film needed a good action director like Renny Harlin or Dwight H. Little or even Karthyn Bigelow. Skip this one even if you're a die hard Murphy fan.

Action pace and comedy by a magnificent Eddie Murphy who is back with his classic character Axel Foley , he is a foul-mouth,street-smart and freewheeling Detroit police agent . When his chief is murdered ,he heads to L.A. to investigate. He arrives to resolve the responsible of death his chief , there finds the old friend Billy(Judge Reinhold) .The clues lead a private law enforcement named Ellis(Timothy Carthart)and henchmen,suspects of killing , they are running a counterfeit money ring at a theme park called Wonder World. He's helped by a pair of sympathetics L.A. detectives(Hector Helizondo,Judge Reinhold) causing wreck havoc on the way as happens at a security guard congress where Ellis is appointed as Name of the Year.This silly third entry is packed with action,thriller, shootouts,fast pace, and tongue in cheek with lots of humor. It's a recital Eddie Murphy accompanied by two sympathetic partners, Reinhold and Helizondo substituting to John Ashton now retired , creating an authentic buddy movie , being developed in agility and movement.The picture contains spectacular scenes,stopped action as is usual in the Don Simpson-Jerry Brukheimer productions. ¨Fish out of water¨ formula is seen in several movies , being here pretty entertaining , it originates enough laughter to satisfy the viewer ,for that reason is bemusing. The picture provides fast and furious amusement with spectaculars scenes and action-packed .Relief comic in charge of Eddie Murphy because of his foul and fast talking creates most big smiles and causing wreak havoc on the way. Besides his various jokes with the sidekicks steal enormous laughters.For that reason the picture is a ¨Buddy movie¨ although are a trio the protagonist Murphy-Reinhold-Helizondo.Eddie Murphy as street-smart detective is top notch, as Axel Foley is his greatest smash hit and converted him into a top international star reaffirming his status with continuous success.Friends's couple,Judge Reinhold and Hector Helizondo, as good policemen, are fine and likable. Director John Landis enhances stunningly the hilarious comic relief of Eddie Murphy for his fast talking and jokes with the buddies that cause most big laughs and the abundant gags subordinated to action.This vehicle for Eddie Murphy as amiable police is terrific,it's his greatest success and became him in a world star confirming his position as number one in the box-office. Cameos by numerous cinema directors as George Lucas, Martha Coolidge, Barget Schroeder, Rick Avery, John Singleton,Ray Harryhausen, George Schaeffer, Joe Dante, among them. Catching music with again the international hit smash by Harol Faltermeyer.Glimmer and colorful cinematography by Marc Alhberg.The motion picture is regularly directed by John Landis because it contains some flaws and gaps. The picture will appeal to unstopped action buffs and Eddie Murphy fans. Rating : Average though amusing.

This film doesn't get high marks from IMDb viewers, but I think I liked it just a tad better than the sequel just prior. I did miss Sergeant Taggart a little since he retired from the Beverly Hills police force, and considering his insubordination in the first two movies of the franchise, seeing Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) promoted was somewhat surprising, but given the span of time involved, it probably makes sense. Hector Elizondo fills in admirably to replace the Taggart character as detective Jon Flint. The presence of Bronson Pinchot as Serge was welcome, he always manages to provide a good dose of humor in those pictures he appears in. The idea that he traded in his art gallery stint for dealing in luxury personal weaponry was wonderfully ironic. The setting of Wonder Land in the picture automatically makes you think of Disneyland, but this was filmed at Paramount's Great America Amusement Park for those particular scenes, and it was fitting that Eddie Murphy took his undercover work seriously enough to dress up as Oki-Doki to help flush out the villains of the piece. With a potential romantic interest thrown in, detective Axel Foley helps the Beverly Hills Police Force solve a crime one more time, this time to avenge the murder of his boss back in Detroit. Having watched the complete franchise on successive days, I'm now prepared for "Beverly Hills Cop IV" almost three full decades since this sequel, plus an additional decade removed from the original. Just proves you can't keep a good cop down.

I've been rewatching this series, and 1 and 2 we're awesome. It took me days to get through this, cos I got bored and kept going back to it, struggling to finish it.Boring compared to the first 2, Axel Foley just kind of seemed 'dumb' in this one, making all kinds of stupid mistakes, none of the intelligence of how he approached things like in the first 2. It was more like they just tried to make it goofy in his approach to things.Not really worth watching, stick to the first 2.

By critics' reviews, Part III may have been the worst off of the three Beverly Hills Cop movies by far; however, I thought it was still fun to watch and great entertainment. Part III deals with Detroit Cop Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) stumbling upon a counterfeit ring, operating from a Beverly Hills theme park by a corrupt community leader Ellis De Wald (Timothy Carhart). Foley witnessed the same man that gunned down his boss when he was investigating a car theft ring in Detroit earlier. As a result, it's back to Beverly Hills for Axel and another mission of exact revenge and clashing with the Beverly Hills Police Department.Although comedies, the first two films had a sensitive and no-nonsense touch to it, dealing with high-profiled police cases. This film, by contrast, has a more light-hearted touch as a large part of the movie is set in a Disneyland-style theme park called Wonderland. I didn't mind this, actually. The movie was still action-packed and Murphy still had his humorous and witty-style while portraying Foley. De Wald, the main villain, is probably the most ruthless of all the bad guys in the three movies - very devious and trigger-happy.Theresa Randle was great as park employee Janice, and she had good on-screen chemistry with Murphy. And, Judge Reinhold returned and gave another memorable performance as the calm and cool Billy Rosewood. I didn't care for the Jon Flint character very much (Hector Elizondo); I thought he served no real purpose in the movie other than trying to intervene with Foley's unsuspecting police moves. I would have preferred the the filmmakers putting Sgt. Taggert's character (John Ashton) back in the movie rather than retiring him off.Rounding up the cast was a bunch of nice cameos by screenwriters, composers and directors, including George Lucus and Richard and Robert Sherman, and a co-star role by Alan Young as Walt Disney-like character Uncle Dave. He gave a memorable and touching role and I wished the filmmakers could have made Young appear in more scenes.Overall, not the best of the Beverly Hills movies, but not a distant third either.Grade B

Come on, lets face it, It may not be the best Beverly Hills Cop movie in the series but they tried their best to make it good. This movie was made 7 years after the second movie was made. Eddie Murphy returns as the wonderful Axel Foley, this time he is trying to find the killer of his boss Insp Todd which who was gunned down on Axel's last assignment. With the help of his friend Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) they go on a roller-coaster ride to Wonderworld to find the killer. This movie is a mixture of action and comedy with some of the best one-liners that Axel has said. Yep this movie is full of swearing like the first two but it has more violence, but hey that's life.Steven E DeSouza wrote this story with the help of Eddie Murphy making rewrites and overall this made a pretty good story. The new producers on the film Robert Rehme and Mace Neufeld take over from Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and the new director the great and funny John Landis takes the helm. Sadly a few actors are missing from this movie there's no John Ashton and Ronny Cox. The movie starts a bit different to the other two movies, there's no starting credits, the movie just starts. But along from that the movie is very funny and is a good part in series. John Landis has put a lot of director cameo's in this movie they are: George Lucas, Martha Coolidge, Joe Dante, Peter Medak, Arthur Hiller, Barbet Schroeder and John Singleton. All of the cameo's from the director's are very funny and makes you wonder if they really do this sort of stuff in real life when they aren't making movies. It might have been panned by critics and people, but overall its very funny and a great movie.

The third installment in the Beverley Hills Cop trilogy is by far the weakest of the three. The first problem is that there isn't even s starting theme tune. The whole feel of the movie is much more slapstick than the first two and ads a result it feels very superficial. With the first there was a feeling that this could possibly happen in real life, but this film is just too silly. Practically none of the regulars are there: Todd's there but he is killed in the first five minutes, there is no sign of Bogomil, Taggart is briefly mentioned as having retired and Jeffrey's not there either. There is much more killing here, which is another unbelievable element. Have said all that it does have a few funny moments, especially from Serge. It's not the worst film ever made, but it's nowhere near as good as the first two in the series and indeed doesn't even feel like a Beverley Hill Cop movie.

Eddie Murphy's third outing as Detroit police detective Axel Foley who seems to have made more of a crime fighting contribution to Beverly Hills still generates some power in the series but the first two films are naturally the better ones. The film inexplicably removes the John Taggart (John Ashton) and Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) characters from the series and adds a shallow new character named John Flint (Hector Elizondo). Fortunately, Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) is still around and he still manages to be a perfect foil for Foley. Foley's third case in Beverly Hills is a little improbable but the action scenes help to make up for the plot which has to do with Foley matching wits with a corrupt head of security (Timothy Carhart) at a popular Beverly Hills amusement park called WonderWorld (a creation of Paramount Parks). The park character costumes and designs are nice and colorful and Theresa Randle helps to pick things up as a potential love interest for Foley but the film doesn't give Murphy very many funny lines and that is a disappointment if one wants to label this film as a comedy. The action is as usual great but Murphy is reknowned as a comedy star and the lack of laughs here prevent this from being a perfect series. Still, it's a very good series.

While I was disappointed with this movie overall, it does have its moments. Hector Elizondo adds some genuine quirkiness, the car chase set-piece is impressive, there is the odd fun visual joke and the production values are pretty good. However, there are a lot of things that make this film for me the weakest of the three. The story is very unoriginal and predictable, the script is pretty poor, John Landis gives one of his weaker directorial jobs, the film isn't as assuredly paced and neither Eddie Murphy or Judge Reinhold come across as likable this time around. Overall, I wouldn't say it was a complete disaster but it is a big disappointment compared to the wonderful original.(the second was disappointing too but watchable) 4/10 Bethany Cox

The most hated film in the Classic BEVERLEY HILLS COP Trilogy is an underrated great film in my opinion.
This extremely underrated Sequel to both the Awesome 80's films is just AS much action packed fun, now it's not as violent or foul mouthed but it's definitely as much Comedy Action as those two.
Beverley Hills Cop 3 was one of those videos i seemed to watch all the time back in the late 90's like i did a few of other Eddie Murphy greats "The Nutty Professor" & "Doctor Doolittle" & "Metro" now those films i just loved so much & recently I've rediscovered my love & Nostalgia for Eddie Murphy films. Recently i watched "Daddy Day Care" & both "DR.Dolittle" films & "The Nutty Professor" with my kids & realised how much i missed watching the comedy legend!!!
Eddie Murphy was one of my all time favourite actors growing up along with Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Smith, Aykroyd, Murray, Chase, Willis, Belushi, Estevez & more, these guys meant alot to me back then growing up & still do now as an adult, but i lost touch with Murphy films after say "Norbit" which i liked & i know it's hated but i liked it.Anyway back to this fun sequel, in part 3 we have Murphy back on top hilarious form as Axel Foley the quick witted & mouthy energetic Cop who here has stumbled apon a criminal organization that's hidden within the big fun family amusement park called "WONDER WORLD" here there's a counterfeit money ring hidden away but Axel is on the case to expose these Criminals & find the man who killed his boss.
It's a great fun story with some amazing action set pieces & lots of funny bits, the cast is cool with Judge Reinhold returning as Detective Rosewood from the other films, also we get a new good Cop to help out in the form of Jon Flint played greatly by Hector Flizondo & a new evil & slimy villain Ellis De Wald played perfectly by Timothy Carhart, it's a solid cast & everyone seems to be loving their parts here.
The wonder world Amusement park is a fantastic backdrop for adventure & lots of the best scenes are in that park & it's simply a whole lot of action packed fun.
I have always loved it & Eddie Murphy was a hero to me growing up in the 90's & he means alot to me still now.
Big Nostalgia for Murphy & his films

Desperation calls again for another badly planned sequel, the third and unfortunately not the charmed last of the Axel Foley series of Detroit cop meets BH cop comedies. John Ashton has moved on so it's Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold and newcomer Hector Elizondo on the case of corruption going on within the happy acres of Wonder World, another fake Disney/Six Flags style amusement park where sadly there are no real amusements. Veteran actor John Saxon is the big boss heavy in this, along the lines of celebrity big boss heavies started with the "Naked Gun" movies.This is the first one where Murphy is actually given a potential romantic interest, the beautiful Theresa Randle who makes up in charm what the film lacks in good taste. Bronson Pichot, who had one scene in the first one, returns in a way that makes no sense, acting like he's best friends with Murphy and Reinhold even though they only met once briefly a decade before. Classic TV fans will delight at the presence of "Mr. Ed" star Alan Young as Wonder World's owner, and Stephen McHattie is a vile federal agent who goes after Murphy in the park with a gun even with tons of kids around. A brief shot of Helen Martin ("227") as an angry grandmother had me laughing and wanting more of her. A major disappointment that proves the movie moguls obsession with sequels may mean box office bucks but lots of razzies as well.

This film deserves more credit then it receives! This film wasn't as good as the first 2 i agree but it was still entertaining on some levels, Murphy was VERY funny in sections of the film, as he always is, and the rest of the cast did pull there weight. The plot is all so extremely interesting, better then the second, But there is one thing that this film lacks....and that is the character trio of Axel rosewood and taggert...there were comedy geniuses at work in the first too. You may call me bias for being a Eddie Murphy fan but this is one of my favourite films in the Beverley hills cop series.....even if it isn't as good.... i like it for the plot, as many of you should, Birkett

How could they make one more than two films in this series? The Beverly Hills Cop movies is a sign to moviegoers everywhere that putting a big star in whatever familiar thing he has done to death already, and way better by the way, is a total lack of originality. If they had only made the darn thing funny at least but John Landis, who is usually pretty dependable as a comedy director, seems more interested in putting cameos by directors in every scene, so it will at least be something that you can kill the time spotting.Every character is dull, and the reprise of Rosewood and Serge's characters only generate mild interest because we have seen them before.The villain, played by Timothy Carhart, is totally expendable and it's a wonder why they couldn't at least have brought in a stereotype police captain like in the first two parts. That would have generated some mild chuckles at least.Murphy would go on playing cops in two more movies to date, but here the general idea of having the outsider cop solve everything has completely lost it's warranty and try making sense of the rather trite closing showdown between the cop and the villain in the amusement park. It's amazing that rival Warner Bros. could make a movie series where the sequels where ten times more entertaining than the two sequels of BHC but maybe it was because they were all made by the same team of Donner and Silver. Three directors have been assigned to a Beverly Hills Cop movie and I think if there is a fourth on the way a new director is hemline that one too.

Beverly Hills Cop 3 is easily the weakest of the trilogy. Gone is the adult action comedy, along with Harold Faltermeyer Scores and John Ashton and Ronny Cox. Instead we get a sometimes goofy film set in a children's theme park, saddled with an awful 90's synth score. The film lacks tension and the set piece on the fairground ride falls flat, lacking any sense of danger and with some awful back projection. On a positive note there are some stand out moments. Ellis Dewald is a strong villain and the awards ceremony always makes me laugh, along with the scene where Eddie Murphy is dancing with the children's characters whilst being chased through the theme park. John Landis seems to have been the wrong director to choose for a Beverly Hills Cop film making it far too comedic but in a more childlike way. Hopefully the upcoming 4th film will put the franchise back on track. For now though stick with the first 2 films.

I have only been on this website for a few short days, and this is only the second review I have done.  So why did I choose this movie to review and not more natural choices?  Because this movie sticks out as one of, if not the worst film, I have ever seen.I loved the first movie - Eddie Murphy was outstanding.  The second film was more entertaining than funny - but it was still good and the characters were strong.That's what made this movie so disappointing.  The pieces were in place. John Landis was back.What they made was a movie so horribly unfunny that five years after seeing it, I still use it as a measuring stick for movie futility.I may have seen worse movies in my life.  But after Beverly Hills Cop III, I can't remember them.

I don't see why everyone bashes this movie, it is a great 3rd Installment to the series, and I don't think it could be better, unless they found a way to include the 3 missing characters from the other two. If you enjoyed the other 2,by all means watch this one. Eddie Murphy makes this movie,like all others he is in, a bundle of laughs and more. This time Axel Foley (Murphy) finds a clue connecting a vicious crime to WonderWorld, an amusement park with a few secrets. Billy Rosewood returns, so don't think Murphy is the only continuing actor of the series, and Axel's boss (The foul-mouthed one) has a part in the movie...MY RATINGS: 7 / 10

In my opinion, Beverly Hills Cop III (I will abbreviate the name as "BHC III" for the rest of my comments) tried to soften the tone of this movie from the extreme action to be more comedy, so it may be make many movies fan, especially, BHC fans disappointed with BHC III.I think many BHC fans at that time (1994 when the movie was released) hoped BHC III could make more fun due to its great action and comedy skit. However, BHC III made this movie more comedy than its precedent, even the first 10 minutes of the movie could show the feeling of action but it was not competent.The death of Insp.Douglas Todd is too easy and no origin. BHC III didn't told any connection about Axel Foley and Todd even everyone could know later that Todd was Foley's boss. But this movie could made confusion to the viewer because Douglas Todd didn't has any role before and he appeared only 5 minutes of the movie.For my comments, I didn't say this movie is bad. The movie has some quite fun scene such as the first time of Axel Foley in Wonderworld. And also this movie has a good plot. However, the climax of the movie made many one disappointed. The death of Ellis De Wald is too silly. Did the BHC III's crew try to make fun on how Foley killed him? If the crew wants to do that, De Wald should be killed by stabbing a quill tohis eye! God Sake! It didn't mean the main villain should died in an extreme situation every time but the fight in the climax should be more interest. Foley and De Wald had a little fight before it became the end of De Waldwhich many one unsatisfied with it. Why the way of the climax didn'tsame as BHC I or BHC II? For the summary, I think this movie is funny at the one point. It's good for comedy but not great for extreme action. I believe many movie fans wish the BHC IV which will be occurred in 2010 should be better than BHC III but if you didn't care about how the comedy was over than action, BHC III could be your one's choice.

I was working on my list of worst movies ever made and a friend mentioned this movie.  I had actually blocked out watching it because it was so bad. The first movie is pretty strong, the second is OK.  This one is one ranks down there with "Batman & Robin" and "Gozilla" as the worst of Hollywood big budget drivel.

I don't know what I expected when I started watching this movie, but I was definitely let down by miles. First of all the dialogue is so bad and cheese, that it sometimes physically hurt to watch. The killing in this movie just takes away from the comedy , and believe me there is loads of killing it. Another negative factor is, that for some unexplainable reason someone thought it was a good idea to make every flame in this movie a bright blue colour, which sometimes really hurts while watching in a dark room. That being said there are some scenes that I found genuinely funny, although most of the time this was unintentional like in action scenes or scenes that where supposed to be serious and dramatic.

Watched this for the first time last night, and was pretty disappointed (was on a triple bill with BHC 1 & 2 on Bravo, great way to ring in the New Year!).Not overly funny, the villains were pretty weak, which is odd as John Saxon is usually pretty good as a bad guy, and Tim Carhart was great as Eddie Willows on CSI. Seemed very forced at times, and definitely lacked the Foley-Rosewood-Taggart chemistry that made the first two films so successful. Hector Elizondo is no replacement for John Ashton.

Cameos by numerous cinema directors as George Lucas, Martha Coolidge, Barget Schroeder, Rick Avery, John Singleton,Ray Harryhausen, George Schaeffer, Joe Dante, among them. Catching music with again the international hit smash by Harol Faltermeyer.Glimmer and colorful cinematography by Marc Alhberg.The motion picture is regularly directed by John Landis because it contains some flaws and gaps. The picture will appeal to unstopped action buffs and Eddie Murphy fans. Rating : Average though amusing.

This film doesn't get high marks from IMDb viewers, but I think I liked it just a tad better than the sequel just prior. I did miss Sergeant Taggart a little since he retired from the Beverly Hills police force, and considering his insubordination in the first two movies of the franchise, seeing Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) promoted was somewhat surprising, but given the span of time involved, it probably makes sense. Hector Elizondo fills in admirably to replace the Taggart character as detective Jon Flint. The presence of Bronson Pinchot as Serge was welcome, he always manages to provide a good dose of humor in those pictures he appears in. The idea that he traded in his art gallery stint for dealing in luxury personal weaponry was wonderfully ironic. The setting of Wonder Land in the picture automatically makes you think of Disneyland, but this was filmed at Paramount's Great America Amusement Park for those particular scenes, and it was fitting that Eddie Murphy took his undercover work seriously enough to dress up as Oki-Doki to help flush out the villains of the piece. With a potential romantic interest thrown in, detective Axel Foley helps the Beverly Hills Police Force solve a crime one more time, this time to avenge the murder of his boss back in Detroit. Having watched the complete franchise on successive days, I'm now prepared for "Beverly Hills Cop IV" almost three full decades since this sequel, plus an additional decade removed from the original. Just proves you can't keep a good cop down.

I've been rewatching this series, and 1 and 2 we're awesome. It took me days to get through this, cos I got bored and kept going back to it, struggling to finish it.Boring compared to the first 2, Axel Foley just kind of seemed 'dumb' in this one, making all kinds of stupid mistakes, none of the intelligence of how he approached things like in the first 2. It was more like they just tried to make it goofy in his approach to things.Not really worth watching, stick to the first 2.

By critics' reviews, Part III may have been the worst off of the three Beverly Hills Cop movies by far; however, I thought it was still fun to watch and great entertainment. Part III deals with Detroit Cop Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) stumbling upon a counterfeit ring, operating from a Beverly Hills theme park by a corrupt community leader Ellis De Wald (Timothy Carhart). Foley witnessed the same man that gunned down his boss when he was investigating a car theft ring in Detroit earlier. As a result, it's back to Beverly Hills for Axel and another mission of exact revenge and clashing with the Beverly Hills Police Department.Although comedies, the first two films had a sensitive and no-nonsense touch to it, dealing with high-profiled police cases. This film, by contrast, has a more light-hearted touch as a large part of the movie is set in a Disneyland-style theme park called Wonderland. I didn't mind this, actually. The movie was still action-packed and Murphy still had his humorous and witty-style while portraying Foley. De Wald, the main villain, is probably the most ruthless of all the bad guys in the three movies - very devious and trigger-happy.Theresa Randle was great as park employee Janice, and she had good on-screen chemistry with Murphy. And, Judge Reinhold returned and gave another memorable performance as the calm and cool Billy Rosewood. I didn't care for the Jon Flint character very much (Hector Elizondo); I thought he served no real purpose in the movie other than trying to intervene with Foley's unsuspecting police moves. I would have preferred the the filmmakers putting Sgt. Taggert's character (John Ashton) back in the movie rather than retiring him off.Rounding up the cast was a bunch of nice cameos by screenwriters, composers and directors, including George Lucus and Richard and Robert Sherman, and a co-star role by Alan Young as Walt Disney-like character Uncle Dave. He gave a memorable and touching role and I wished the filmmakers could have made Young appear in more scenes.Overall, not the best of the Beverly Hills movies, but not a distant third either.Grade B

Come on, lets face it, It may not be the best Beverly Hills Cop movie in the series but they tried their best to make it good. This movie was made 7 years after the second movie was made. Eddie Murphy returns as the wonderful Axel Foley, this time he is trying to find the killer of his boss Insp Todd which who was gunned down on Axel's last assignment. With the help of his friend Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) they go on a roller-coaster ride to Wonderworld to find the killer. This movie is a mixture of action and comedy with some of the best one-liners that Axel has said. Yep this movie is full of swearing like the first two but it has more violence, but hey that's life.Steven E DeSouza wrote this story with the help of Eddie Murphy making rewrites and overall this made a pretty good story. The new producers on the film Robert Rehme and Mace Neufeld take over from Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and the new director the great and funny John Landis takes the helm. Sadly a few actors are missing from this movie there's no John Ashton and Ronny Cox. The movie starts a bit different to the other two movies, there's no starting credits, the movie just starts. But along from that the movie is very funny and is a good part in series. John Landis has put a lot of director cameo's in this movie they are: George Lucas, Martha Coolidge, Joe Dante, Peter Medak, Arthur Hiller, Barbet Schroeder and John Singleton. All of the cameo's from the director's are very funny and makes you wonder if they really do this sort of stuff in real life when they aren't making movies. It might have been panned by critics and people, but overall its very funny and a great movie.

The third installment in the Beverley Hills Cop trilogy is by far the weakest of the three. The first problem is that there isn't even s starting theme tune. The whole feel of the movie is much more slapstick than the first two and ads a result it feels very superficial. With the first there was a feeling that this could possibly happen in real life, but this film is just too silly. Practically none of the regulars are there: Todd's there but he is killed in the first five minutes, there is no sign of Bogomil, Taggart is briefly mentioned as having retired and Jeffrey's not there either. There is much more killing here, which is another unbelievable element. Have said all that it does have a few funny moments, especially from Serge. It's not the worst film ever made, but it's nowhere near as good as the first two in the series and indeed doesn't even feel like a Beverley Hill Cop movie.

Eddie Murphy's third outing as Detroit police detective Axel Foley who seems to have made more of a crime fighting contribution to Beverly Hills still generates some power in the series but the first two films are naturally the better ones. The film inexplicably removes the John Taggart (John Ashton) and Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) characters from the series and adds a shallow new character named John Flint (Hector Elizondo). Fortunately, Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) is still around and he still manages to be a perfect foil for Foley. Foley's third case in Beverly Hills is a little improbable but the action scenes help to make up for the plot which has to do with Foley matching wits with a corrupt head of security (Timothy Carhart) at a popular Beverly Hills amusement park called WonderWorld (a creation of Paramount Parks). The park character costumes and designs are nice and colorful and Theresa Randle helps to pick things up as a potential love interest for Foley but the film doesn't give Murphy very many funny lines and that is a disappointment if one wants to label this film as a comedy. The action is as usual great but Murphy is reknowned as a comedy star and the lack of laughs here prevent this from being a perfect series. Still, it's a very good series.

While I was disappointed with this movie overall, it does have its moments. Hector Elizondo adds some genuine quirkiness, the car chase set-piece is impressive, there is the odd fun visual joke and the production values are pretty good. However, there are a lot of things that make this film for me the weakest of the three. The story is very unoriginal and predictable, the script is pretty poor, John Landis gives one of his weaker directorial jobs, the film isn't as assuredly paced and neither Eddie Murphy or Judge Reinhold come across as likable this time around. Overall, I wouldn't say it was a complete disaster but it is a big disappointment compared to the wonderful original.(the second was disappointing too but watchable) 4/10 Bethany Cox

The most hated film in the Classic BEVERLEY HILLS COP Trilogy is an underrated great film in my opinion.
This extremely underrated Sequel to both the Awesome 80's films is just AS much action packed fun, now it's not as violent or foul mouthed but it's definitely as much Comedy Action as those two.
Beverley Hills Cop 3 was one of those videos i seemed to watch all the time back in the late 90's like i did a few of other Eddie Murphy greats "The Nutty Professor" & "Doctor Doolittle" & "Metro" now those films i just loved so much & recently I've rediscovered my love & Nostalgia for Eddie Murphy films. Recently i watched "Daddy Day Care" & both "DR.Dolittle" films & "The Nutty Professor" with my kids & realised how much i missed watching the comedy legend!!!
Eddie Murphy was one of my all time favourite actors growing up along with Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Smith, Aykroyd, Murray, Chase, Willis, Belushi, Estevez & more, these guys meant alot to me back then growing up & still do now as an adult, but i lost touch with Murphy films after say "Norbit" which i liked & i know it's hated but i liked it.Anyway back to this fun sequel, in part 3 we have Murphy back on top hilarious form as Axel Foley the quick witted & mouthy energetic Cop who here has stumbled apon a criminal organization that's hidden within the big fun family amusement park called "WONDER WORLD" here there's a counterfeit money ring hidden away but Axel is on the case to expose these Criminals & find the man who killed his boss.
It's a great fun story with some amazing action set pieces & lots of funny bits, the cast is cool with Judge Reinhold returning as Detective Rosewood from the other films, also we get a new good Cop to help out in the form of Jon Flint played greatly by Hector Flizondo & a new evil & slimy villain Ellis De Wald played perfectly by Timothy Carhart, it's a solid cast & everyone seems to be loving their parts here.
The wonder world Amusement park is a fantastic backdrop for adventure & lots of the best scenes are in that park & it's simply a whole lot of action packed fun.
I have always loved it & Eddie Murphy was a hero to me growing up in the 90's & he means alot to me still now.
Big Nostalgia for Murphy & his films

Desperation calls again for another badly planned sequel, the third and unfortunately not the charmed last of the Axel Foley series of Detroit cop meets BH cop comedies. John Ashton has moved on so it's Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold and newcomer Hector Elizondo on the case of corruption going on within the happy acres of Wonder World, another fake Disney/Six Flags style amusement park where sadly there are no real amusements. Veteran actor John Saxon is the big boss heavy in this, along the lines of celebrity big boss heavies started with the "Naked Gun" movies.This is the first one where Murphy is actually given a potential romantic interest, the beautiful Theresa Randle who makes up in charm what the film lacks in good taste. Bronson Pichot, who had one scene in the first one, returns in a way that makes no sense, acting like he's best friends with Murphy and Reinhold even though they only met once briefly a decade before. Classic TV fans will delight at the presence of "Mr. Ed" star Alan Young as Wonder World's owner, and Stephen McHattie is a vile federal agent who goes after Murphy in the park with a gun even with tons of kids around. A brief shot of Helen Martin ("227") as an angry grandmother had me laughing and wanting more of her. A major disappointment that proves the movie moguls obsession with sequels may mean box office bucks but lots of razzies as well.

This film deserves more credit then it receives! This film wasn't as good as the first 2 i agree but it was still entertaining on some levels, Murphy was VERY funny in sections of the film, as he always is, and the rest of the cast did pull there weight. The plot is all so extremely interesting, better then the second, But there is one thing that this film lacks....and that is the character trio of Axel rosewood and taggert...there were comedy geniuses at work in the first too. You may call me bias for being a Eddie Murphy fan but this is one of my favourite films in the Beverley hills cop series.....even if it isn't as good.... i like it for the plot, as many of you should, Birkett

How could they make one more than two films in this series? The Beverly Hills Cop movies is a sign to moviegoers everywhere that putting a big star in whatever familiar thing he has done to death already, and way better by the way, is a total lack of originality. If they had only made the darn thing funny at least but John Landis, who is usually pretty dependable as a comedy director, seems more interested in putting cameos by directors in every scene, so it will at least be something that you can kill the time spotting.Every character is dull, and the reprise of Rosewood and Serge's characters only generate mild interest because we have seen them before.The villain, played by Timothy Carhart, is totally expendable and it's a wonder why they couldn't at least have brought in a stereotype police captain like in the first two parts. That would have generated some mild chuckles at least.Murphy would go on playing cops in two more movies to date, but here the general idea of having the outsider cop solve everything has completely lost it's warranty and try making sense of the rather trite closing showdown between the cop and the villain in the amusement park. It's amazing that rival Warner Bros. could make a movie series where the sequels where ten times more entertaining than the two sequels of BHC but maybe it was because they were all made by the same team of Donner and Silver. Three directors have been assigned to a Beverly Hills Cop movie and I think if there is a fourth on the way a new director is hemline that one too.

Beverly Hills Cop III (1994)-Although this was the third in the series, I don't think that it hurt the film at all. With 'Lethal Weapon' (1987), the concept got progressively more boring and tired, whereas Axel's trips to The Hills seemed to still have some life left in them, even on his third outing.I think that I preferred the calmer version of Axel in this film, although I understand that it was apparently due to Eddie's own depression at the time. I think that, as with the second film, the difference made it feel like he had grown as a character and matured regardless of the reasons.Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) was still a fun character for Axel to bounce with and Hector Elizondo filling in where John Ashton couldn't return, worked well. He was similar enough to cause little distraction, but still able to play someone a bit new and interesting, although he didn't have a huge role and the focus was mostly on Foley, Rosewood and a potential love interest for the lead character, which I also liked, as it once again showed that he was growing.I actually don't know why there was so much flack for this one, it's fun and action packed and would have been exactly what audiences wanted when it was released. I think that it's an easy story that could almost be for family viewing, except for the boobs and swearing. I liked the fact that it wasn't taxing, but still entertained.What I also liked was that I didn't know who to trust throughout. It had been a very long time since I had seen it and while there were some baddies that were identified right from the start, it was difficult to know if someone he was close to might stab him in the back. That part of the story was very clever and I'm not saying who did, if they did or if they didn't, or if something completely different happened instead.I did have to wonder why the detectives never carried a camera with them though? They could have proved their crimes in minutes. The film would have obviously been a lot shorter however.It's definitely one to return to every once in a while, because it didn't drag me through anything, but left me satisfied and amused.674.32/1000.

I have only been on this website for a few short days, and this is only the second review I have done.  So why did I choose this movie to review and not more natural choices?  Because this movie sticks out as one of, if not the worst film, I have ever seen.I loved the first movie - Eddie Murphy was outstanding.  The second film was more entertaining than funny - but it was still good and the characters were strong.That's what made this movie so disappointing.  The pieces were in place. John Landis was back.What they made was a movie so horribly unfunny that five years after seeing it, I still use it as a measuring stick for movie futility.I may have seen worse movies in my life.  But after Beverly Hills Cop III, I can't remember them.

I don't see why everyone bashes this movie, it is a great 3rd Installment to the series, and I don't think it could be better, unless they found a way to include the 3 missing characters from the other two. If you enjoyed the other 2,by all means watch this one. Eddie Murphy makes this movie,like all others he is in, a bundle of laughs and more. This time Axel Foley (Murphy) finds a clue connecting a vicious crime to WonderWorld, an amusement park with a few secrets. Billy Rosewood returns, so don't think Murphy is the only continuing actor of the series, and Axel's boss (The foul-mouthed one) has a part in the movie...MY RATINGS: 7 / 10

Beverly Hills Cop 3 is easily the weakest of the trilogy. Gone is the adult action comedy, along with Harold Faltermeyer Scores and John Ashton and Ronny Cox. Instead we get a sometimes goofy film set in a children's theme park, saddled with an awful 90's synth score. The film lacks tension and the set piece on the fairground ride falls flat, lacking any sense of danger and with some awful back projection. On a positive note there are some stand out moments. Ellis Dewald is a strong villain and the awards ceremony always makes me laugh, along with the scene where Eddie Murphy is dancing with the children's characters whilst being chased through the theme park. John Landis seems to have been the wrong director to choose for a Beverly Hills Cop film making it far too comedic but in a more childlike way. Hopefully the upcoming 4th film will put the franchise back on track. For now though stick with the first 2 films.

I was working on my list of worst movies ever made and a friend mentioned this movie.  I had actually blocked out watching it because it was so bad. The first movie is pretty strong, the second is OK.  This one is one ranks down there with "Batman & Robin" and "Gozilla" as the worst of Hollywood big budget drivel.
