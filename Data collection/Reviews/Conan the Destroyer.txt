For fantasy-geeks like myself, this 1984 outing of the legendary swordsman is an interesting mix of highs and lows. The cinematography, costumes and settings are a high-point, remaining loyal to Frazetta's incredible illustrations.Gone, unfortunately, is the first film's solid, adult screenplay. Howard's original, "Nietzschean" Conan is watered-down here, the director deciding to play for laughs (but Conan and his world just is'nt comedic).Like the dialogue, the casting is sometimes hit and miss. Although Grace Jones (as the wild warrioress Zula) has been criticized as "over the top", she puts in a solid, believable performance. Sarah Douglas also shines as Queen Taramis, although we don't see enough of her! Arnie is adequate, as is Mako (who reprises his role here as a helpful wizard).The film suffers most from poor special effects (an unforgivable crime for fantasy lovers)! It looks like they spent most of the budget on actors and settings, but even by 1980s standards, the monsters Conan faces were absurd.Lessons were not learned, ending with the debacle of "Red Sonja" a year later. Arnie admitted that film to be "the worst he ever made". "Destroyer" amounts to harmless entertainment, lacking conviction, but watchable all the same.

If you're looking for a deep, interesting and layered fantasy flick which makes sense and has an original story, go rent out the first Conan movie. Conan the Destroyer is pure Hollywood cheese, made because the Conan the Barbarian was such a hit. The studio execs made the story more light-hearted, with sidekicks and magic and the kind of story a thirteen-year-old could watch without getting in trouble.Oddly enough, it works. While it's light years away from Robert E Howard's original Conan stories, Conan the Destroyer is still great fun, even twenty years after it was made. Arnold Schwarzenegger makes the most of the very silly lines he's given, Tracey Walter proves a capable if somewhat pointless comic foil, and the irony of casting Wilt Chamberlain as a protector of a young princess' virginity is hilarious.Mako hams it up, Grace Jones takes it all too seriously and Olivia D'Abo makes for a good childlike princess because she was 16 when the film got made. The music's over-dramatic, the lines are laughable ("Some wizard you are! Go back to juggling apples!") and the story's cliché, but for Saturday night viewing, nothing beats Conan the Destroyer.Possibly Interesting Trivia: This movie was produced by Raffaela De Laurentis, daughter of the famous Dino De Laurentis. She also produced the confusing big-budget epic "Dune". Both Dune and this movie flopped at the box office, and both were filmed in Mexico.

The plot moves on at a fair old pace from one big set piece to another and it is clear the film had a decent budget. In fact, I would say that this is excellent bubblegum sword and sorcery fodder except for a few minor, but annoying quirks. For one thing the comedy sidekick Malak is phenomenally irritating, badly acted, and takes any tension, interest etc out of any scene. Clearly they were going for a wider 'family' appeal with this film, but this was also clearly a decision made some time down the filming process. Most obviously this hits home during the fight scenes with some very choppy cutting as some of the more gruesome bits have been removed. And Conan's second encounter with the camel suffers from this too! That aside the cast carry off their roles with aplomb, Grace Jones in particular really getting across her character's zest for and love of combat. One of the better hack and slash films out there.

Oh, I can understand why "Conan the Destroyer" is the way it is.  The original, classic "Conan the Barbarian" was a hit, but the Hollywood bigwigs decided they could get x-amount more money if they made a more family-friendly sequel, thereby opening the franchise to the lucrative kid's market (never mind that, for as long as there have been "restrictive" movie ratings, kids have known how to get to see the movies they want).  Take out the sex, tone down the violence, crank up the humor, and... out comes this movie.It's like "Destroyer" is stuck in a state of half-development.  The basic storyline would be okay, but the script gives Conan a coterie of unneccessary sidekicks (as if Conan were not a strong enough character to carry a movie by himself).  Grace Jones is interesting to look at but gets tiresome VERY fast; the cowardly sidekick gets more irritating by the second; Mako wears this expression like he's only in this one for the money. Olivia d'Abo is just plain miscast: it's like she's a marker that should read "Insert More Interesting Character in Second Draft."  Arnold Schwarzenegger does a competent job as Conan, but we don't see the raw power and brute force of the first movie.  There is a thin line between competence and complacency, between an actor and a star; it took Roger Moore six years to get to that point in the James Bond series, while Schwarzenegger reaches the same point with Conan in two.I think part of the problem is whether or not the Conan concept is flexible enough to become family fare, and my answer is "no."  Fans of Robert E. Howard's Conan work know his Cimmerian is a very rough-edged hero, a cunning, hard-drinking, hard-fighting man, and the first Conan movie captured that essence.  To change him into the simple-minded do-gooder of "Conan the Destroyer" is to destroy what Conan is all about, and the movie suffers for it.Is "Conan the Destroyer" worth watching?  Yes.  For someone who knows absolutely nothing about Conan, I suppose it can be a harmless sword-and-sorcery popcorn flick.  For Conan fans, it's kind of like "Legend of the Lone Ranger" for Lone Ranger fans: an irresistible example of just how badly Hollywood can treat your favorite character.I just hope that if there is ever another Conan movie (not likely, thanks to "Destroyer"), the producers will concentrate on following the style of "Conan the Barbarian" and just ignore this one.

This is an epic adventure based on Robert E Howard's pulp tales with screenplay by the comic-book authors, Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway , it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role, the Hyborian Age hero . This time Conan with the help his partner (Tracey Walter), a magician (Mako, who repeats his role as wizard of ¨Conan the Barbarian ¨ by John Milius and written by Oliver Stone), an androgynous sidekick( Grace Jones who steals the show ), as a club-wielding tomboy, a giant hoodlum (Wilt Chamberlain) and a virgin princess(Olivia DÁbo) undergo on a risked trip to find a treasure whose sacred jewel contains a magic horn that relives a monster (manufactured by Carlo Rambaldi : ET) and leading a vibrant ending.This violent following packs noisy action, full-blooded adventure, thrills, crude scenes and rip-roaring fights. Dumb images and unintentionally hilarious but amusing . Made on a grand scale with spectacular production design and colorful cinematography by Jack Cardiff, occasionally filmmaker. Big budget and lavishly produced by Raffaela De Laurentis, Dino's daughter. Impressive musical score composed and conducted by Basil Poledouris as vibrant as the original Conan. In other words, it seem likely Conan enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted. Followed by several low-grade imitations and rip offs, and spawned TV series starred by Ralph Moller. Furthermore a similar film realized in old-fashioned style also directed by Richard Fleischer titled ¨Red Sonja¨ with Brigette Nielsen as female lead , Sandahl Bergman and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger has a brief guest spot. And in production a new ¨Conan¨ by Marcus Nispel with Jason Momoa,Rose McGowan and Ron Perlman.

Sadly, sequels are rarely as good as the original, and with Conan the Barbarian being such a good movie, this one had to produce something special to live up to its predecessor.Well, we still got Arnie as Conan, so that's a good start. And we have one of the other cast members from the first flick, in the shape of Mako. But that's about where any good stuff ends.The first death knell for this movie is the casting. We have Tracey Walter as Malak, a thief side-kick of Conan's (whatever happened to Gerry Lopez's Subotai character?) Tracey does a very good impression of Peter Lorre...throughout the whole film. Then there's Grace Jones (perhaps the original singer-turned-actor) as some kind of demented she-warrior. All she is really good at is glaring at people and hissing like a snake and she does this......throughout the whole film. Sarah Douglas as the obligatory evil queen...the only thing she seems to be queen of is sequels (Superman 2, Puppetmaster 3, Beastmaster 2 etc.) and Olivia D'Abo, who is just irritatingly helpless and annoying here.The plot is trivial and the dialogue poor and some of the effects are lamentably bad (look for the island in the lake and the "man-ape"). Also, did I mention that Grace Jones is just horrible and hisses a lot? I did? Oh well, it bears repeating..All in all, this is a cash-in movie, designed to rake in some easy money on the back of the original and not really caring much about a plot or good actors. Even Arnie, the world's best actor at not saying many lines, is hampered by having too much dialogue.Avoid it unless you want a laugh.

Conan The Barbarian stands as one of the best epic movies of all time. Conan The Destroyer is what Batman and Robin is to the Batman series. The whole dark atmosphere and seriousness of the first movie is traded for a children-friendly approach that ruined the whole appeal of Conan.The Plot: The wicked Queen Taramis(played by Sarah Douglas) dupes Conan to escort her princess niece (played by Olivia D'Aba) on a quest for some sacred horn in exchange to bring back Conan's lost love, Valeria, from the dead. Conan embarks on the trip with the princess accompanied by Bombaata(Wilt Chamberlain) who is secretly ordered to kill Conan. On the way they befriend a fierce captive Zula(played by Grace Jones) and trouble ensues.Opinion: Conan The Destroyer is laughably bad. The actions scenes are hilarious and you know it's a problem when someone getting decapitated provokes laughter. Each head that gets lopped off and each sword in the gut seem so cartoonish plus you have to deal with the third rate acting. Sarah Douglas and Olivia D'Aba are both wooden and Wilt Chamberlain(RIP) and Grace Jones both seem out of place in this picture. Arnold is his usual self so don't expect much. Not only is the plot weak but the score is redundant also. Conan The Barbarian had a great score to accompany every scene. Here the score is monotonous and weak. I can only recommend this to you if you want to complete you collection other than that skip it.

While the original 'Conan the Barbarian' was more dramatic, the sequel is played more for laughs. Nonetheless, it is still a highly entertaining sword and sorcery fantasy flick. The music is again outstanding and carries the movie where the dialogue fails. Of particular note is Wilt Chamberlain's impressive performance as the immense Bombatta. He has a tremendous screen presence, more than just his stature (plus he had to do his own stunts!).There are lots of memorable scenes throughout the movie. Not a cerebral film, just good old-fashioned fantasy!

This film is more lighter in tone than John Milius' classic, Conan The Barbarian. Probably due to a more lightweight director, Richard Fliescher coming on board, and more importantly a script by Marvel Comics writers Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway. However, the mix is more enjoyable this time around, not as interesting or impessive than its predescessor, but more fun. Arnold never looked more mightier than here, looking like the true Marvel Comics equivelent of the hero, rather than Milius' or Robert Howards version. The script is pretty dull, it has to be said, owing from the likes of Steve Reeves Hercules movies and the classics of Ray Harrihausen. But there is still Arnold, the wonderfull sets, the powerful Basil Poledouris theme, and a cast of Grace Jones, Sarah Douglas, Tracey Walter, Mako, Wilt Chamberlain and Olivier D'Abo, who some how manage to make this resemble an episode of the 60's Batman T.V Series than a piece of Robert Howard soaked fantasy.The fighting scenes a re good and there is a fantastic scene in wich Conan is trapped in a cave of mirrors terrorised by Red-Hooded monsters. The only way to kill them? To smash the mirrors of course. Pure Marvel Comics fantasy.

The original Conan movie - Conan The Barbarian - came out in 1982 and was both a popular sword and sorcery film and a reasonably successful attempt to turn bodybuilder Arnold Scwarzenegger into a movie star. However, the critics were somewhat unkind to John Milius's fantasy epic, stating that it was far too long, far too serious and far too humourless. On that occasion, the critics were wrong - I, and many others, like Conan The Barbarian BECAUSE of its length and its seriousness. The story feels thorough and atmospheric, and the pace is controlled, not dull. It is very sad that this sequel addresses the very things that were falsely alleged to be "wrong" or "flawed" about the original. It's as if the makers of Conan The Destroyer sat down and listed all the criticisms ever levelled at Conan The Barbarian, then tried to do something to rectify them. So, this sequel is shorter, more lightweight and more humorous than its predecessor. Does it work? Have these changes resulted in a massive improvement? No. In fact, Conan The Destroyer is actually vastly inferior to the original, and is little more than a juvenile romp aimed at bloodthirsty kids and slightly nerdy adults.Fearsome Cimmerian warrior Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his travelling companion Malak (Tracey Walter, in a bad comic characterisation) are summoned to carry out a dangerous quest on behalf of the treacherous Queen Taramis (Sarah Douglas). She promises that if the quest is a success she will reincarnate Conan's long-dead lover so that he may be reunited with her. The mission requires Conan to take a virginal princess named Jehnna (Olivia D'Abo) on a journey to recover a magical crystal. The princess is the only person who can handle the crystal which, when used correctly, will unlock the gateway to an all-powerful horn. With this horn, Taramis plans to awaken a deity and share God-like power with it by sacrificing Jehnna. Along the way, Conan picks up other travelling companions to aid him in his quest, such as the female barbarian Zula (Grace Jones) and inexperienced magician Akiro (Mako). However, Taramis has lied to Conan in order to secure his services; she not only has no intention of bringing his lover back to life, but also plans to kill him once his usefulness is over.Conan The Destroyer is not a total loss - in fact, in some departments it is actually quite good. Basil Poledouris again provides pulsating music (not quite as good as his scoring of the earlier film, but good enough all the same); Jack Cardiff's photography brings the vast sets and varied locations colourfully to life; there are even infrequent bursts of real excitement. But Conan The Destroyer is repeatedly dragged down by its numerous flaws - ill-suited comedy, listless performances, obvious special effects, and an episodic narrative. In particular this last criticism is a major disappointment. The story is episodic to the point of tedium. The characters ride around, chat about love and magic, then arrive at some kind of temple or castle where a little action ensues. Again and again, with irritating repetition and boring monotony, this same sequence recurs - ride, chat, action.... ride, chat, action.... ride, chat, action.... ride, chat, action.... Conan IS a destroyer - but, unfortunately, what he's destroying is his own genre!!

After the worldwide success of CONAN THE BARBARIAN, it was inevitable that a sequel would be made (director John Milius envisioned the saga as a trilogy, with an aged Conan ruling his own kingdom in the final chapter). But Universal, seeing star Arnold Schwarzenegger as appealing more to younger audiences, did not like the R-rated combination of gore, sex, and machismo philosophy of the first film, so Milius was unceremoniously dumped, and more family-friendly action director Richard Fleischer was brought in to helm CONAN THE DESTROYER. Working with a script by comic book scribes Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, much of what made the first film so unique was tossed aside. While Milius had Arnold lose weight and study Oriental swordsmanship, in an effort to tone down the bodybuilder look, and make him more flexible and believable as an arena-trained warrior, Fleischer ordered the actor to bulk up as much as possible, hoping to recreate the impossibly-muscled giant painted by Frank Frazetta on the covers of the paperback CONAN novels. Instead of being a taciturn loner, Conan would joke and 'care' about people, with an idiot sidekick (Tracey Walter) to provide comic relief. Bloodletting would be mainly off-camera, sex would consist solely of flashes of cleavage, and any monsters faced would be toned-down so children wouldn't be traumatized. While all this succeeded in garnering a PG rating, the end result was less Robert Howard's barbarian, more the generic B-movie hero seen in the dozens of imitations CONAN THE BARBARIAN had inspired.The plot is simple; Cruel but beautiful Queen Taramis (SUPERMAN I and II villainess Sarah Douglas) promises to revive Conan's dead love, Valeria, if he'll lead virgin Princess Jehnna (Olivia d'Abo) and her bodyguard (basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain), on a quest to steal a giant diamond, and use it to recover a horn that will bring god Dagoth to life. Joined by his sidekick, Malak, a wizard (Mako), and a female warrior (Grace Jones), the group faces the usual array of monsters, wizards, and enemy soldiers, and defeats them all, succeeding in the quest...but Conan discovers, nearly too late, that the bodyguard has been ordered to murder him, after the horn is retrieved, and that Jehnna is to be sacrificed as part of the process of reviving Dagoth...While the fight between Conan and Toth-Amon (Pat Roach), in a hall of mirrors, is well-staged and exciting, much of the rest of the film seems flat, with one scene, of Conan blind drunk at a campfire, ridiculously out of character and silly. CONAN THE DESTROYER didn't achieve anywhere near the success of the original, but Schwarzenegger had no reason to worry; his next film would be a low-budget SF thriller called THE TERMINATOR, and he was about to become a superstar!A footnote to CONAN...in early 2003, Schwarzenegger and John Milius tentatively agreed to bring CONAN THE KING, the final chapter of the saga, to the screen...With the original director's vision, and the improvements in FX that CGI has provided, we may yet see the ULTIMATE Conan film reach the screen, if Arnold's political career doesn't take precedence!

much campier then the first film, it attempts to make for Conan's lack of depth with a large supporting cast. (they used up all his depth in the first film). Yet it is worth it just to see Grace, Wilt Chamberlin and all the rest of the cast bust some serious heads.

What made Conan the Barbarian a great movie was the fact that Arnold played Conan as a person who was shut away and not talked to for most of his formative years. The first movie had minimal dialogue, and it made it seem like whenever Conan had something to say, it was important. In this movie, he seems to be talking every other second. He even hams it up doing pratfalls when he is drunk. It takes the emotionally stoic backbone out of the barbarian from the earlier movie. Arnold is an action star, not a stage actor.

This is an absurd and hastily made sequel to the far superior Conan the Barbarian. They were probably attempting to cash in on the newfangled barbarian craze, but this film caused the anticipated Conan the Barbarian 3 to never be made. Which is unfortunate, because I love a good barbarian movie as much as the next Italian guy.Swartz is back as the colossally hulking paleoanthropic warrior who has more muscle than brains. This time around, the landscape looks like something out of a cheap fantasy movie, and nothing ever clicks or feels like the original. The difference with this movie and the first film is, the original had a believability to it, and this one just oozes out vacuous emptiness.The plot concerns a princess who must fight an evil sorceress. Not much there to begin with.Along the line, there are more absurd characters, including Grace Jones, who resembles a twig and yet beats men 8 times her size with a paltry stick. Chamberlain is even more lackluster as a mute personal guard to the spoiled princess who has special powers to defeat darkness.Look for the awful 'non-moving face' monster in the hall of mirrors, it is about as scary as a dead fish.Even as a kid I hated this movie.Still, barbarian movies are few and far between, and even with all its faults, it still beats anything that the Italians or Croatians put out.

After the box-office success of 'Conan The Barbarian', it was inevitable that a sequel would be made.  'Conan The Destroyer' may lack the brutality and some of the excitement from its predecessor, but it's not too bad.This time, Conan is on a mission to help Princess Jehnna (Olivia D'Abo) retrieve a magic horn.  The queen has promised him that if he is successful in reaching this goal, she will revive his dead love.  However, early on we learn that the queen plans to betray him.The film can get a little silly at times, however it remains quite entertaining throughout.  It may not be as good as its predecessor,  but it is definitely worth watching. (6/10)

What a shame this is. The first film is so gorgeous with it's metaphoric dialogue, bombastic soundtrack, and Nietzsche-isms throughout. Yet here they changed directors and added a PATHETIC excuse of an ensemble cast and the results are outright disastrous. Too much humor, too many beasts, not enough deranged characters who talk like unholy prophets. I guess they wanted to reach a wider audience. How sad. Robert E. Howard must be rolling over in his grave.

FunWith an aesthetic and atmosphere closer to Conan's comics, whoever says no, has not read them in his life, because in John Millius, despite being a masterpiece, many concepts were invented that had nothing to do with the universe of Howard, mixing them with the Scandinavian mythology, since the director is a lover of the stories of vikíngos.In this, what a veteran Richard Fleischer offered us, aged 70 or so when he shot it, is an entertaining adventure and fantasy film, full of action and sense of humor and showing those huge and incredible kingdoms that were shown to us in the comics.Schwarzenegger is here much more active, speaks more, interacts more with the characters around him and also shows his most comedic side. His partner and servant Malak, played by the great Tracey Walter, one of those actors that you see everywhere, is the one that carries the most comical and carefree part of the film.The gigantic Mombaata, played by the legendary basketball player Wilt Chamberlain, one of the 50 best in history, according to the NBA, the bodyguard of the young naive and somewhat annoying princess Jehnna, Olivia d Abbo.Sarah Douglas, is the beautiful and evil, or perhaps manipulated by the priests of the cult of Dagoth, Taramis, queen of Shadizar, and it still hurts me to see how badly wasted she is, since her character was for much more.Later on they will be joined by the late actor Mako, as the wizard Akiro, the only actor with Schwarzenegger and the camel, who repeat in the sequel. And of course, Zula, a Grace Jones ultra-sexy and more exotic than ever.The film is not a B Series, as many people think, since it had a budget around 18 million dollars, higher than the first one, although it does not look as it should, since special effects are nowadays totally childish and crappy. However the setting in that wonderful country that is Mexico, with its deserts and valleys, is fascinating and fits perfectly into the universe of the hero.It is true that it is not better than the first, but it is that the approach is different anyway.In the first one was to present a character, with a completely adult tone, it was not even for children, which caused that it was crushed by criticism, which labeled it as pseudo-pornographic and made by a psychopath, for a future trilogy that never took place, and here what we have is an adventure film, entertaining, light, very funny, and that even with its defects it is superior to most of the clunkers, of the genre of sword and witchcraft, of that no doubt.

Personally I prefer this film to the original. "Conan The Barbarian' was slow moving and,while James Earl Jones was excellent, Schwarzenegger was blatantly atrocious. Surrounded by the talent in this film you don't notice how bad he is as often.High marks are scored by Olivia D'Abo as the impudent Princess Jehnna, Sarah Douglas as the sexy,evil queen, and Mako in a comic turn as the Wizard and the stories narrator. Add Tracy Walters and you have a fine supporting cast.Grace Jones and WIolt Chamberlain add nothing to the film except a bit of visual diversity, Jones sneers a lot and Wilt just isn't much of an actor,although he comes off better than Schwarzenegger. The plot is nothing to speak of. Its been done before, but its fun,colorful and its not a bad way to pass 2 hours of your time.

-SPOILERS BELOW- God what a letdown. First I gotta say i LOVED Conan the Barbarian, probably my 2nd favorite movie of all time. It was well written and well directed. The characters were convincing. They were dirty and unkempt. They looked fearsome...and best of all, THEY COULD ACT! Sadly this on has none of these elements. Its pure eighties cheese. They traded the realistic, dirty, dark look for oiled muscles, clean looking b movie outfits, and feathered hair. The acting is the essence of wooden. While the thief in the first movie was somewhat fearsome, his counterpart in this is a ridiculous coward that does not fit at all (and whats with the New Yawkish accent?). The first was set in a believably asianesque/mongolian setting. This is apparently set in some sort of fantasy kingdom (where are the elves??). And I got to say (SPOILER) the Ice castle was ridiculous, and the wizard Conan battles in the hall of mirrors looks like he bought his mask at the mall during discount days. Throwing Grace Jones at this movie doesn't make it any better, and Wilt Chamberlin as a character makes about as much sense as casting Shaq in Lord Of The Rings. The God/Beast battle at the end is mildly cool, but far too little too late. This movie just feels thoroughly watered down, hollywoodized, and neutered. Fans of the original, or anyone for that matter, avoid this rubbish unless you are having your own do it yourself Mystery Science Theater episode at home. It really is that bad :(

For fantasy-geeks like myself, this 1984 outing of the legendary swordsman is an interesting mix of highs and lows. The cinematography, costumes and settings are a high-point, remaining loyal to Frazetta's incredible illustrations.Gone, unfortunately, is the first film's solid, adult screenplay.

Dumb images and unintentionally hilarious but amusing . Made on a grand scale with spectacular production design and colorful cinematography by Jack Cardiff, occasionally filmmaker. Big budget and lavishly produced by Raffaela De Laurentis, Dino's daughter. Impressive musical score composed and conducted by Basil Poledouris as vibrant as the original Conan. In other words, it seem likely Conan enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted. Followed by several low-grade imitations and rip offs, and spawned TV series starred by Ralph Moller.

Queen Taramis (Sarah Douglas) offers Conan the barbarian (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to bring back his love Valeria back from the dead. Conan and his sidekick Malak (Tracey Walter) is to escort Taramis' virgin niece Jehnna (Olivia d'Abo) to find a key and a jewel horn. Her bodyguard Bombaata (Wilt Chamberlain) accompanies them but Taramis tells him to double-cross Conan. On the way, Conan saves wizard Akiro (Mako) and Zula (Grace Jones) and they join the ragtag band of travelers.It's sillier than the first movie. Its saving grace is that it's fun as long as you don't take it seriously. I think the dialog actually got more clunky. There is certainly nothing quite like this. Grace Jones looks crazy awesome. Mako and Tracey Walter are making jokes. Wilt Chamberlain is actually acting. At least he's not much worst than Arnie. Olivia d'Abo looks really pretty. This is one crazy group.

Sadly, sequels are rarely as good as the original, and with Conan the Barbarian being such a good movie, this one had to produce something special to live up to its predecessor.Well, we still got Arnie as Conan, so that's a good start. And we have one of the other cast members from the first flick, in the shape of Mako. But that's about where any good stuff ends.The first death knell for this movie is the casting. We have Tracey Walter as Malak, a thief side-kick of Conan's (whatever happened to Gerry Lopez's Subotai character?) Tracey does a very good impression of Peter Lorre...throughout the whole film. Then there's Grace Jones (perhaps the original singer-turned-actor) as some kind of demented she-warrior. All she is really good at is glaring at people and hissing like a snake and she does this......throughout the whole film. Sarah Douglas as the obligatory evil queen...the only thing she seems to be queen of is sequels (Superman 2, Puppetmaster 3, Beastmaster 2 etc.) and Olivia D'Abo, who is just irritatingly helpless and annoying here.The plot is trivial and the dialogue poor and some of the effects are lamentably bad (look for the island in the lake and the "man-ape"). Also, did I mention that Grace Jones is just horrible and hisses a lot? I did? Oh well, it bears repeating..All in all, this is a cash-in movie, designed to rake in some easy money on the back of the original and not really caring much about a plot or good actors. Even Arnie, the world's best actor at not saying many lines, is hampered by having too much dialogue.Avoid it unless you want a laugh.

When I was a little girl, my parents were hooked on the Conan movies, but The Destroyer always stood out to me more for some reason. But I haven't watched this movie for a very long time, so the other night, I was in a weird mood, I decided to watch the Conan movies. So The Destroyer was more familiar to me. But the thing is, this movie is a sort of break through for Arnold, since this movie was a flop at the box office, he doesn't like sequels, The Terminator being his only exception. So I was curious as an adult if this movie really was as bad as it's made out to be, I liked it a little bit when I was a kid, but when you're a kid, you're fascinated by anything. So watching this movie, as cheesy as it was, I still had a good time watching it. I understand why a lot of people have a distaste for it, it's definitely not up to par with the first Conan, it's more of a comedy vs. adventure. But I still enjoyed this movie, it's a good bad film that entertained me.Conan and his partner, Malek, are brought before Queen Taramis, who asks that Conan perform two tasks for her: obtain a special gem and retrieve the magic horn that can awaken the god, Dagoth. In exchange, she offers to resurrect Conan's dead lover, Valeria. Conan agrees. Conan, Malak, Jehnna, the queen's niece, and Bombaata set off on their journey. Along the way, Conan enlists the aid of his old comrade Akiro and the group later encounters Zula, who joins the party. They then set off after the magical horn, which is kept inside of a mysterious fortress. Jehnna retrieves the horn. After some difficulty from the cult residing in the fortress, they try to make their way back to Queen Taramis however, Bombaata betrays Conan and takes Jehnna, leaving the others to fight for their lives.The story is a bit much and it's not the same as the original, but if you give it a fair enough chance, I think you'll enjoy it too. It is a bit more comedic and steers away from the original story, but I think the comedy still made it fun. I loved the addition of Grace Jones, she was one tough chick and could stand proudly next to Conan; even if she did have a silly Japanese anime type of look to her hair in the end. I loved the costumes and the special effects and of course, Arnold. Conan is the part that he was meant to play and he carries the movie well with the other cast. Granted I know the direction isn't really good, it does have a more cheesy vibe as this was the same director for our favorite barbarian box office flop that was Red Sonja. There are a lot of plot holes and a script that could us a more than a few touch up's, but give the movie a fair enough chance, don't compare it to the original, on it's own, I'm sure you'll have a good time watching it.7/10

Conan The Barbarian stands as one of the best epic movies of all time. Conan The Destroyer is what Batman and Robin is to the Batman series. The whole dark atmosphere and seriousness of the first movie is traded for a children-friendly approach that ruined the whole appeal of Conan.The Plot: The wicked Queen Taramis(played by Sarah Douglas) dupes Conan to escort her princess niece (played by Olivia D'Aba) on a quest for some sacred horn in exchange to bring back Conan's lost love, Valeria, from the dead. Conan embarks on the trip with the princess accompanied by Bombaata(Wilt Chamberlain) who is secretly ordered to kill Conan. On the way they befriend a fierce captive Zula(played by Grace Jones) and trouble ensues.Opinion: Conan The Destroyer is laughably bad. The actions scenes are hilarious and you know it's a problem when someone getting decapitated provokes laughter. Each head that gets lopped off and each sword in the gut seem so cartoonish plus you have to deal with the third rate acting. Sarah Douglas and Olivia D'Aba are both wooden and Wilt Chamberlain(RIP) and Grace Jones both seem out of place in this picture. Arnold is his usual self so don't expect much. Not only is the plot weak but the score is redundant also. Conan The Barbarian had a great score to accompany every scene. Here the score is monotonous and weak. I can only recommend this to you if you want to complete you collection other than that skip it.

The great warrior, Conan, is promised the return of his beloved Valeria if he will lead a quest to find a horn which belongs to an evil god, Dagoth. Along this journey, accompanied by the princess of whose kingdom worships Dagoth and her giant guardian, Conan will find others to assist him along the way as they come across heavy resistance and danger to their mission to retrieve the horn.I've read many considering this a homage of sorts to Seven Samurai, and while it does contain a group joining forces to defeat a powerful enemy, this is more of an adventure tale with sword and sorcery(..absent the nudity and gore from Conan the Barbarian which actually appeals to those yearning for the more gratuitous elements sacrificed to obtain a larger audience). Quite an eclectic group we follow, too. Grace Jones as a tribal warrior. Wilt Chamberlain as the princess' guard who we all know could turn on Conan any moment. Mako as a powerful magician whose saved from nearly being a feast for a cannibal tribe. Jeff Corey as a thief who swallows gems he steals. Olivia d'Abo, the virginal princess who secretly desires Conan. The most unfortunate decision was a limited Sarah Douglas who is perfect as the sinister Queen Taramis who wants to sacrifice d'Abo so that she can command Dagoth to do her will, with designs on ruling the world..she gets little screen time which is a shame, because she's so wonderfully evil Instead the film spends a lot of time on the journey with Conan, Bombaata(Chamberlain), and princess Jehnna(d'Abo)gathering up allies, encountering opposition, providing fans with plenty of swordplay. A little bloodier than I had remembered, but nowhere near as ultra-violent as Conan the Barbarian. Arnold Schwarzenegger was in fine form during this period, but the movie doesn't demand him to flex in acting muscle, just his pecks when he wields his sword at his adversaries. Most often chuckle at Chamberlain's performance, but, let's be honest, we all know he was hired for his towering presence not his acting chops. Grace Jones goes all out as she normally does, with a giant stick, battling men with swords, eyes bulging, hyena screeching, the works. The Mexico locations provide this film with the proper setting needed for warriors battling in caves, deserts, and under the hot sun. Far less serious approach is applied here compared to Conan the Barbarian which might be why it received less critical reception. Most of the graphic violence is shot away from the viewers' eyes, certain to earn a PG rating, but what did the filmmakers sacrifice in return? Contains another masterful Basil Poledouris score, adding a riveting thrill to the battles not to mention providing Conan with a majestic aura.

This mildly entertaining sequel to "Conan the Barbarian" is, unsurprisingly, not in the same league as its predecessor. The basic problem is a common one for many viewers: this is a somewhat watered-down, PG-rated Conan that just doesn't have a lot of intensity. Ultimately it gets too fantastically silly for its own good, in an obvious attempt to bring in the younger audience. It's not the same seeing Conan in this kind of juvenile adventure. The quest that Conan and comrades embark upon is also lacking in any truly perilous episodes. It certainly was typical of the kind of low-grade stuff that veteran director Richard Fleischer ("20,000 Leagues Under the Sea", "The Narrow Margin") was churning out at this stage in his career.Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the muscle-bound Cimmerian warrior who is approached by an icy Queen (Sarah Douglas) with an offer: accompany a princess named Jehnna (Olivia d'Abo) on a journey she must take according to prophecy. In return, she will restore his great love Valeria to life. Of course, since this Queen is played by Douglas, otherwise known as Ursa in two of the "Superman" movies, we KNOW that she's going to have a nefarious agenda going on.Conan is accompanied by characters such as Bombaata (basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain, in his only film role), a feisty fighter named Zula (the always striking Grace Jones), a goofball thief, Malak (the great eccentric character actor Tracey Walter), and the wizard Akiro (Mako, also returning from the first film).On location filming in Mexico helps a great deal, as well as solid work from talents such as production designer Pier Luigi Basile and the legendary cinematographer Jack Cardiff. The music by Basil Poledouris is also a very worthy component. Carlo Rambaldi created the amusingly designed monster-god Dagoth, and it's highly amusing to note that this creation was played by none other than wrestling star Andre Roussimoff, a.k.a. Andre the Giant.Unfortunately there is no epic feel to this sequel, and while there is violence, it doesn't have a lot of punch. The finale when Dagoth comes to life is at least fairly entertaining. The acting is either hammy (Mako), adequate, or hilariously stiff (Chamberlain and Jones). Walter, while very reliable most of the time, acts too contemporary and is simply out of place here.All things considered, this viewer can see why some fantasy fans would be very dissatisfied with "Conan the Destroyer". It's actually not that bad as entertainment, but it's better to take it on its own terms rather than compare it to "Barbarian", as it would always come up short.Five out of 10.

While the original 'Conan the Barbarian' was more dramatic, the sequel is played more for laughs. Nonetheless, it is still a highly entertaining sword and sorcery fantasy flick. The music is again outstanding and carries the movie where the dialogue fails. Of particular note is Wilt Chamberlain's impressive performance as the immense Bombatta. He has a tremendous screen presence, more than just his stature (plus he had to do his own stunts!).There are lots of memorable scenes throughout the movie. Not a cerebral film, just good old-fashioned fantasy!

This film is more lighter in tone than John Milius' classic, Conan The Barbarian. Probably due to a more lightweight director, Richard Fliescher coming on board, and more importantly a script by Marvel Comics writers Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway. However, the mix is more enjoyable this time around, not as interesting or impessive than its predescessor, but more fun. Arnold never looked more mightier than here, looking like the true Marvel Comics equivelent of the hero, rather than Milius' or Robert Howards version. The script is pretty dull, it has to be said, owing from the likes of Steve Reeves Hercules movies and the classics of Ray Harrihausen. But there is still Arnold, the wonderfull sets, the powerful Basil Poledouris theme, and a cast of Grace Jones, Sarah Douglas, Tracey Walter, Mako, Wilt Chamberlain and Olivier D'Abo, who some how manage to make this resemble an episode of the 60's Batman T.V Series than a piece of Robert Howard soaked fantasy.The fighting scenes a re good and there is a fantastic scene in wich Conan is trapped in a cave of mirrors terrorised by Red-Hooded monsters. The only way to kill them? To smash the mirrors of course. Pure Marvel Comics fantasy.

The original Conan movie - Conan The Barbarian - came out in 1982 and was both a popular sword and sorcery film and a reasonably successful attempt to turn bodybuilder Arnold Scwarzenegger into a movie star. However, the critics were somewhat unkind to John Milius's fantasy epic, stating that it was far too long, far too serious and far too humourless. On that occasion, the critics were wrong - I, and many others, like Conan The Barbarian BECAUSE of its length and its seriousness. The story feels thorough and atmospheric, and the pace is controlled, not dull. It is very sad that this sequel addresses the very things that were falsely alleged to be "wrong" or "flawed" about the original. It's as if the makers of Conan The Destroyer sat down and listed all the criticisms ever levelled at Conan The Barbarian, then tried to do something to rectify them. So, this sequel is shorter, more lightweight and more humorous than its predecessor. Does it work? Have these changes resulted in a massive improvement? No. In fact, Conan The Destroyer is actually vastly inferior to the original, and is little more than a juvenile romp aimed at bloodthirsty kids and slightly nerdy adults.Fearsome Cimmerian warrior Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his travelling companion Malak (Tracey Walter, in a bad comic characterisation) are summoned to carry out a dangerous quest on behalf of the treacherous Queen Taramis (Sarah Douglas). She promises that if the quest is a success she will reincarnate Conan's long-dead lover so that he may be reunited with her. The mission requires Conan to take a virginal princess named Jehnna (Olivia D'Abo) on a journey to recover a magical crystal. The princess is the only person who can handle the crystal which, when used correctly, will unlock the gateway to an all-powerful horn. With this horn, Taramis plans to awaken a deity and share God-like power with it by sacrificing Jehnna. Along the way, Conan picks up other travelling companions to aid him in his quest, such as the female barbarian Zula (Grace Jones) and inexperienced magician Akiro (Mako). However, Taramis has lied to Conan in order to secure his services; she not only has no intention of bringing his lover back to life, but also plans to kill him once his usefulness is over.Conan The Destroyer is not a total loss - in fact, in some departments it is actually quite good. Basil Poledouris again provides pulsating music (not quite as good as his scoring of the earlier film, but good enough all the same); Jack Cardiff's photography brings the vast sets and varied locations colourfully to life; there are even infrequent bursts of real excitement. But Conan The Destroyer is repeatedly dragged down by its numerous flaws - ill-suited comedy, listless performances, obvious special effects, and an episodic narrative. In particular this last criticism is a major disappointment. The story is episodic to the point of tedium. The characters ride around, chat about love and magic, then arrive at some kind of temple or castle where a little action ensues. Again and again, with irritating repetition and boring monotony, this same sequence recurs - ride, chat, action.... ride, chat, action.... ride, chat, action.... ride, chat, action.... Conan IS a destroyer - but, unfortunately, what he's destroying is his own genre!!

After the worldwide success of CONAN THE BARBARIAN, it was inevitable that a sequel would be made (director John Milius envisioned the saga as a trilogy, with an aged Conan ruling his own kingdom in the final chapter). But Universal, seeing star Arnold Schwarzenegger as appealing more to younger audiences, did not like the R-rated combination of gore, sex, and machismo philosophy of the first film, so Milius was unceremoniously dumped, and more family-friendly action director Richard Fleischer was brought in to helm CONAN THE DESTROYER. Working with a script by comic book scribes Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, much of what made the first film so unique was tossed aside. While Milius had Arnold lose weight and study Oriental swordsmanship, in an effort to tone down the bodybuilder look, and make him more flexible and believable as an arena-trained warrior, Fleischer ordered the actor to bulk up as much as possible, hoping to recreate the impossibly-muscled giant painted by Frank Frazetta on the covers of the paperback CONAN novels. Instead of being a taciturn loner, Conan would joke and 'care' about people, with an idiot sidekick (Tracey Walter) to provide comic relief. Bloodletting would be mainly off-camera, sex would consist solely of flashes of cleavage, and any monsters faced would be toned-down so children wouldn't be traumatized. While all this succeeded in garnering a PG rating, the end result was less Robert Howard's barbarian, more the generic B-movie hero seen in the dozens of imitations CONAN THE BARBARIAN had inspired.The plot is simple; Cruel but beautiful Queen Taramis (SUPERMAN I and II villainess Sarah Douglas) promises to revive Conan's dead love, Valeria, if he'll lead virgin Princess Jehnna (Olivia d'Abo) and her bodyguard (basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain), on a quest to steal a giant diamond, and use it to recover a horn that will bring god Dagoth to life. Joined by his sidekick, Malak, a wizard (Mako), and a female warrior (Grace Jones), the group faces the usual array of monsters, wizards, and enemy soldiers, and defeats them all, succeeding in the quest...but Conan discovers, nearly too late, that the bodyguard has been ordered to murder him, after the horn is retrieved, and that Jehnna is to be sacrificed as part of the process of reviving Dagoth...While the fight between Conan and Toth-Amon (Pat Roach), in a hall of mirrors, is well-staged and exciting, much of the rest of the film seems flat, with one scene, of Conan blind drunk at a campfire, ridiculously out of character and silly. CONAN THE DESTROYER didn't achieve anywhere near the success of the original, but Schwarzenegger had no reason to worry; his next film would be a low-budget SF thriller called THE TERMINATOR, and he was about to become a superstar!A footnote to CONAN...in early 2003, Schwarzenegger and John Milius tentatively agreed to bring CONAN THE KING, the final chapter of the saga, to the screen...With the original director's vision, and the improvements in FX that CGI has provided, we may yet see the ULTIMATE Conan film reach the screen, if Arnold's political career doesn't take precedence!

much campier then the first film, it attempts to make for Conan's lack of depth with a large supporting cast. (they used up all his depth in the first film). Yet it is worth it just to see Grace, Wilt Chamberlin and all the rest of the cast bust some serious heads.

Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads a ragtag group of adventurers on a quest for a princess.When John Milius, director of "Conan the Barbarian", proved to be unavailable to direct the sequel, Dino De Laurentiis suggested Richard Fleischer to his daughter Raffaella De Laurentiis, who was producing Conan the Destroyer. Fleischer had already made "Barabbas" (1961) and "Mandingo" (1975) for Dino De Laurentiis. Yes, this is from the same guy who gave us "Mandingo"! From the first film, the violence and such was toned down, dropping from an R to a PG. Some would say this hurt the film, but I think it might actually be better. It makes it more fun and definitely more of a comic book or pulp story. Despite decreased sales, it apparently was good enough that they moved ahead with a part three (which was shelved, then reworked into "Kull") and "Red Sonja".

What made Conan the Barbarian a great movie was the fact that Arnold played Conan as a person who was shut away and not talked to for most of his formative years. The first movie had minimal dialogue, and it made it seem like whenever Conan had something to say, it was important. In this movie, he seems to be talking every other second. He even hams it up doing pratfalls when he is drunk. It takes the emotionally stoic backbone out of the barbarian from the earlier movie. Arnold is an action star, not a stage actor.

After the box-office success of 'Conan The Barbarian', it was inevitable that a sequel would be made.  'Conan The Destroyer' may lack the brutality and some of the excitement from its predecessor, but it's not too bad.This time, Conan is on a mission to help Princess Jehnna (Olivia D'Abo) retrieve a magic horn.  The queen has promised him that if he is successful in reaching this goal, she will revive his dead love.  However, early on we learn that the queen plans to betray him.The film can get a little silly at times, however it remains quite entertaining throughout.  It may not be as good as its predecessor,  but it is definitely worth watching. (6/10)

This is an absurd and hastily made sequel to the far superior Conan the Barbarian. They were probably attempting to cash in on the newfangled barbarian craze, but this film caused the anticipated Conan the Barbarian 3 to never be made. Which is unfortunate, because I love a good barbarian movie as much as the next Italian guy.Swartz is back as the colossally hulking paleoanthropic warrior who has more muscle than brains. This time around, the landscape looks like something out of a cheap fantasy movie, and nothing ever clicks or feels like the original. The difference with this movie and the first film is, the original had a believability to it, and this one just oozes out vacuous emptiness.The plot concerns a princess who must fight an evil sorceress. Not much there to begin with.Along the line, there are more absurd characters, including Grace Jones, who resembles a twig and yet beats men 8 times her size with a paltry stick. Chamberlain is even more lackluster as a mute personal guard to the spoiled princess who has special powers to defeat darkness.Look for the awful 'non-moving face' monster in the hall of mirrors, it is about as scary as a dead fish.Even as a kid I hated this movie.Still, barbarian movies are few and far between, and even with all its faults, it still beats anything that the Italians or Croatians put out.

I think it's fair to say that a lot of movie sequels just don't live up to their predecessors. The same can be said of CONAN THE DESTROYER, in which a definite case of "dumbing down" has been performed to make the film appeal to a younger audience. Gone is the excess violence and downbeat story of CONAN THE BARBARIAN, and in its place a family-orientated and lighthearted adventure full of wisecracks and unnecessary comedy. I have to say that this kind of comedy is the bane of '80s (and later) sword and sorcery movies for me. The peplum films of the '60s which covered similar themes did well enough without them, and if I want to watch a comedy then I'll do just that. I'm not a fan of genre crossbreeds.However, if you accept that this film has a lighter spirit and is made in a totally different style to the first then there is much to enjoy, if you ignore the mid-'80s cheesiness. The film has lots of action and swordplay to recommend it, and while the blood doesn't flow as thickly as in the first, there is still a fair share of gruesomeness and decapitated heads. There's also an assortment of monsters for Conan and his friends to fight, and I'm a sucker for monsters. One cheesy highlight has Arnie battling a beast-man (called "Man-Ape") in a hall of mirrors which ends with the villain being bloodily dispatched. Also popping up are a tribe of bloodthirsty cannibals, and at the end of the film, the Lovecraftian God "Dagoth" comes to life from a statue as a huge horned slimy monster (played by wrestler Andre the Giant). It's all fun stuff to watch, if not particularly profound.The film once again has some impressive location filming in the desert, and some of the sweeping visuals that made the first so memorable. Also present is another score from Basil Poledouris, which reuses some of the first film's music to good effect. The costumes look good and Richard Fleischer's direction is pacing and keeps things moving along nicely. The special effects do look very dated in today's light but are still impressive to an undemanding fan, with the dream team of Italian effects aces Giannetto de Rossi and Carlo Rombaldi supplying the makeup and the Dagoth creature respectively. Probably the worst effect was the animated bird that Pat Roach turns into.Arnold Schwarzenegger here returns as a more vocal Conan, but he's still up to his old tricks like punching out horses and performing incredible feats of strength. In one scene he bends bars like in a Steve Reeves epic - I liked the reference. Schwarzenegger has a more mainstream supporting cast this time, including the gigantic basketball player Wilt Chamberlain as a traitor, probably the only man capable of making Arnie look small in comparison! Grace Jones puts in a memorable turn as a fierce warrior woman although I've never cared for the actress. Mako returns from the first film as well, although in a very small nearly pointless supporting role (although he does have one funny wizard battle). Tracey Walter is actually quite likable as the irritating whiny sidekick, and deserves commendation for being such. Olivia d'Abo's character of a spoilt Princess is extremely aggravating but her good looks make up for that. Other familiar faces like those of Sarah Douglas, Pat Roach and Ferdy Mayne flesh out the rest of the roles.The plot is a very simplistic one and not ideal, taking the usual form of a quest for a stolen crystal, or some such nonsense. The fact that Arnie's ally is in fact a traitor gives the film an edge in that we (the audience) know that he's preparing to kill Arnie but Arnie himself doesn't realise. Things culminate in an over-the-top finale in which the pair have an impressively powerful battle, ending in Arnie getting his ear bitten off (maybe Tyson watched this to get tips)! Then, of course, there's the lightning, storm, collapsing palace and howling weird monster-thing for our hero to battle. It's all very silly and cheesy, really, but I couldn't help enjoying it while watching. Not ideal but still a fun movie if you're in the right mood.

What a shame this is. The first film is so gorgeous with it's metaphoric dialogue, bombastic soundtrack, and Nietzsche-isms throughout. Yet here they changed directors and added a PATHETIC excuse of an ensemble cast and the results are outright disastrous. Too much humor, too many beasts, not enough deranged characters who talk like unholy prophets. I guess they wanted to reach a wider audience. How sad. Robert E. Howard must be rolling over in his grave.

FunWith an aesthetic and atmosphere closer to Conan's comics, whoever says no, has not read them in his life, because in John Millius, despite being a masterpiece, many concepts were invented that had nothing to do with the universe of Howard, mixing them with the Scandinavian mythology, since the director is a lover of the stories of vikíngos.In this, what a veteran Richard Fleischer offered us, aged 70 or so when he shot it, is an entertaining adventure and fantasy film, full of action and sense of humor and showing those huge and incredible kingdoms that were shown to us in the comics.Schwarzenegger is here much more active, speaks more, interacts more with the characters around him and also shows his most comedic side. His partner and servant Malak, played by the great Tracey Walter, one of those actors that you see everywhere, is the one that carries the most comical and carefree part of the film.The gigantic Mombaata, played by the legendary basketball player Wilt Chamberlain, one of the 50 best in history, according to the NBA, the bodyguard of the young naive and somewhat annoying princess Jehnna, Olivia d Abbo.Sarah Douglas, is the beautiful and evil, or perhaps manipulated by the priests of the cult of Dagoth, Taramis, queen of Shadizar, and it still hurts me to see how badly wasted she is, since her character was for much more.Later on they will be joined by the late actor Mako, as the wizard Akiro, the only actor with Schwarzenegger and the camel, who repeat in the sequel. And of course, Zula, a Grace Jones ultra-sexy and more exotic than ever.The film is not a B Series, as many people think, since it had a budget around 18 million dollars, higher than the first one, although it does not look as it should, since special effects are nowadays totally childish and crappy. However the setting in that wonderful country that is Mexico, with its deserts and valleys, is fascinating and fits perfectly into the universe of the hero.It is true that it is not better than the first, but it is that the approach is different anyway.In the first one was to present a character, with a completely adult tone, it was not even for children, which caused that it was crushed by criticism, which labeled it as pseudo-pornographic and made by a psychopath, for a future trilogy that never took place, and here what we have is an adventure film, entertaining, light, very funny, and that even with its defects it is superior to most of the clunkers, of the genre of sword and witchcraft, of that no doubt.

Personally I prefer this film to the original. "Conan The Barbarian' was slow moving and,while James Earl Jones was excellent, Schwarzenegger was blatantly atrocious. Surrounded by the talent in this film you don't notice how bad he is as often.High marks are scored by Olivia D'Abo as the impudent Princess Jehnna, Sarah Douglas as the sexy,evil queen, and Mako in a comic turn as the Wizard and the stories narrator. Add Tracy Walters and you have a fine supporting cast.Grace Jones and WIolt Chamberlain add nothing to the film except a bit of visual diversity, Jones sneers a lot and Wilt just isn't much of an actor,although he comes off better than Schwarzenegger. The plot is nothing to speak of. Its been done before, but its fun,colorful and its not a bad way to pass 2 hours of your time.

-SPOILERS BELOW- God what a letdown. First I gotta say i LOVED Conan the Barbarian, probably my 2nd favorite movie of all time. It was well written and well directed. The characters were convincing. They were dirty and unkempt. They looked fearsome...and best of all, THEY COULD ACT! Sadly this on has none of these elements. Its pure eighties cheese. They traded the realistic, dirty, dark look for oiled muscles, clean looking b movie outfits, and feathered hair. The acting is the essence of wooden. While the thief in the first movie was somewhat fearsome, his counterpart in this is a ridiculous coward that does not fit at all (and whats with the New Yawkish accent?). The first was set in a believably asianesque/mongolian setting. This is apparently set in some sort of fantasy kingdom (where are the elves??). And I got to say (SPOILER) the Ice castle was ridiculous, and the wizard Conan battles in the hall of mirrors looks like he bought his mask at the mall during discount days. Throwing Grace Jones at this movie doesn't make it any better, and Wilt Chamberlin as a character makes about as much sense as casting Shaq in Lord Of The Rings. The God/Beast battle at the end is mildly cool, but far too little too late. This movie just feels thoroughly watered down, hollywoodized, and neutered. Fans of the original, or anyone for that matter, avoid this rubbish unless you are having your own do it yourself Mystery Science Theater episode at home. It really is that bad :(
