I'm an old dude, 75 to be exact, and in my working days I was everything from a mainframe programmer to a HiTech startup Tech Admin. This sentence is here only to show why I am interested in the productions of Dreamworks and, of course, Pixar. Coming from a computer background permits me to be very, very impressed with the wonderful skill and creativity that go into making movies such as Shreck.Now then: The movie itself is marvelous! The characters are gentle and funny; there is no gratuitous violence; there are innuendos, of course, but skillfully done in a way that the "libretto" if you will can be "read" at least two levels. The story line itself is charming, and the ending is a real, nifty surprise!I add here that I've watched this with my younger G_Kids, who loved it; and also with my bride of fifty years, who loved it.It is in all ways in a class with the best that Mr. Jobs has so far produced, which is saying a great deal.HIGHLY recommended as good, funny, charming entertainment for a whole bunch of ages.Nick Fortis Los Altos California

Shrek is a wonderful parody of every fairytale story that you can think of, for the kids it has charm, humour and tons of fun, and is a delightful film for them to enjoy. In addition, Shrek has plenty of subtle innuendo and more adult themes running seamlessly along side the story, much of which may pass younger children by, without spoiling any element of their enjoyment; while at the same time enhancing the enjoyment for the older viewers.Shrek is simply so well created that it can successfully appeal to a huge audience excellently voiced as it is, by Mike Myers, John Lithgow, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy.Brilliant characters, solid script and hilarious parody, make this film a simply wonderful achievement, and that's without mentioning the awesome computer generated world that houses it.9/10

The originality of this cinematic masterpiece is striking, as it exxxpertly blends layers of popular Indo-European fairytale culture with a creative, meaningful yet comedic story of discrimination, valour, love and lust for power.Ogreall, it is a true must-watch for fairytale fanatics of all ages.You are what you eat.

9 OUT OF 10!!!! We went to catch the matinee preview of "Shrek". We were still giggling by the time we got home afterwards. Two hours later, we dragged a friend out and went back for the evening show. Some of the shock value was lost, but we caught a few of the background sight gags we missed the first time, and anticipation of some of the other scenes had us in tears before they even happened. Interesting to see the different audience reactions of different age groups, too. This is a *very* funny movie, but it should be noted that most of the kiddy humour is on the burp/fart and yucky dining habits level - Shrek is rather closely related to Raymond Briggs' Fungus the Bogeyman without the orange mohawk. The dialogue and main action quips are mainly aimed at adults and sophisticated kids. One little voice in the afternoon audience piping up "WHAT's he compensating for?" cracked me up...Be warned that this movie is a non-stop send-up of all things Disney. If predictability and saccharine is your cup of tea, you may not like it. On the other hand, if you are cynical about theme parks and like the idea of fairytale classics getting the Monty Python treatment, you'll love it. Every time a scene looks familiar, it means it is about to go pear-shaped. And it's not just old classics that get the treatment. I spotted (mis)quotes from films that are just being released, both Disney and non-Disney. You name it, it gets an affectionate pie in the face at some point in "Shrek".As a fairytale, however offbeat, "Shrek" is tighter plotted and better characterised than most Hollywood dross.The parodic twists, a love story subplot that owes more to Shakespeare's comedies than fairytale formula, and the "ugly is the new beautiful" Message more than make up for the derivativeness due to extensive quotation.As for the acting, confinement to voice-overs keeps the egos of Myers and Murphy in check, and they do a fantastic job as the big fat green smelly recluse and the obnoxiously manic donkey respectively. Diaz is great as a feisty princess who reminds me of Lloyd Alexander's Eilonwy crossed with Lara Croft. Lithgow's Farquaad is a wonderful Bad Guy, modelled on Olivier's Richard III apart from his Little Problem being different. And the Fairytale Creatures...excellent, all of them. The graphics, of course, are state of the art for at least another 2 weeks. We're talking freckles, skin pores and stubble, pupil dilation, and amazing light-and-shade. They had to tone down the realism of the humanoids to stop them looking creepily android-like.Highly recommended, except for overly precious schmalz addicts.

I never set the bar too high for children or animated films because adults can never seem to get into them.  Adults go to animated films because their kids complain and fuss and drag them to see it with them.  Meanwhile, the parent is stuck there trying to watch the movie, but can't because all the children are either asleep or screaming their lungs out and the parent just wants to go see the new action flick playing right next door.  It's a waste of $7.00, I know.  However, Shrek was a real treat to go to and is meant for an older crowd.The bedtime stories our parents used to tell us as children and which we pass down to ours is retold to please a much older crowd who grew up with these stories.  It's a spoof of all the fairy tales that we all know. However, this story has a wonderful twist to it.  There's no prince charming and there's no dashing night to save the day.  Shrek is an ogar, who has to rescue the princesses so he can get back his land from the storybook characters that have overrun it.Mike Myers is witty and brilliant as the voice of Shrek.  He allows the role of Shrek to come alive.  This probably has to be one of Mike Myers' better films, and the great thing about working as a voice animator is that you don't have to spend three hours in make up and another hour or so in wardrobe.  You can just get up at six o' clock in the morning go in say your lines and get out.The other great thing about this movie is that it spoofs of such movies as the matrix and almost any fairy tale ever made.  However, it so original in plot.Eddie Murphy steals the screen as the talking donkey.  It seems everything out of his mouth gets wittier and wittier throughout the entire movie.  He brightens up the screen with a zany performance.Cameron Diaz shines as the princesses.  She enlightens us with her witty charm and surprising outbursts.   John Lithgow plays the devious prince who sends Shrek on the quest to save the princesses.  For some reason John Lithgow seems to have an amazing and talented voice.  All in all I enjoyed the film and would give it about a 7.  If you liked the movie I would suggest watching There's Something About Mary, Wayne's World, and Austin Powers.

Shrek is completely new.  Never has a fully CGI movie taken on the twists, turns, and surprises as Shrek has.  It's a full parody of numerous fairytales, and its humor is, well, humor at its best.  Grown men will laugh at the jokes of Farquaad's Stature and the hidden meaning behind every little comment.  Of course Shrek, like all other movies, has its emotional moments (so what if I lied about it being completely new?).  And these moments aren't cheesy or anything.  They are kind of funny, but at the time of viewing you won't really feel like laughing.  You'll feel like the characters.Like its CGI, Shrek has taken a new dimension.  It stretches out.  You're in the movie.  No, wait, you're watching a movie.  It's so hard to tell.  The characters are so real, so lifelike, it makes you feel you're there.  The environments are realistic, yet still animated.  The wind whispers through the grasslands and the characters' hair; the lightning and clouds are really there... aren't they?I was stunned and absorbed in this movie.  And unlike other movies, it has more than just CGI.  It's actually got a plot.  And what a plot it's got! This one is totally new.  Shrek is ordered to rescue a princess from the fiery keep guarded by a dragon in order to clear out his swamp of the menacing fairytale creatures.But it doesn't stop there.  The movie is full of surprises and stretches on further into what actually happens after.  The dialogue demands your attention throughout the movie, and then the dragon comes in.  Whenever you see the dragon, you'll know good things are bound to happen (but not necessarily for the characters in the movie).  The dragon is a comic relief, but still provides most of the action in the movie.  She chases Donkey and Shrek through the keep, she flies to help rescue Fiona from a despicable marriage, and she even has the satisfaction of swallowing a midget.Now some disputes have arisen about certain things.  But I must say what I always say:  this is only a movie, and it has no deeper meaning (despite the parodies).  Take it as it is.  There can be nothing offensive from Shrek unless you have something against overthrowing tyrants and good-natured humor.I must take a moment to speak about Donkey.  He is, and always will be, one of my most favorite characters in the world of movies.  Eddie Murphy was, no doubt, the perfect actor for him.  He is so funny, so unique, and so... fluffy.  What a perfect donkey!  His design is flawless and his dialogue perfect.  I can find nothing bad about this character.Shrek is perfect for everybody to see.  The little ones will love the vivid colors and lush landscapes.  The adults will enjoy this as well as the intelligent humor and deep plot.  And no one could dislike the arrangement of songs.  They fit really nice into the movie.  Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell's composed music is impressive (especially the theme for Escape from the Dragon).Shrek is brilliant moviemaking.  With a groundbreaking DVD, an all-star cast, great music, excellent graphics, and a great parodized yet original plot and storyline, Shrek is no doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen.

I did not get to see this in theaters though my family got the movie on DVD that fall and it was one of my first DVD movies. The cast was excellent, especially John Lithgow and Mike Myers and the visuals were stunning. Many parts of the movie were spoofs of old films and there were many laughs to be heard. Cameron Diaz as the princess was good too, though she's hardly a damsel in distress. Which works nicely considering her abilities (which I won't say here). Some good songs and even a cameo by Disney cartoon veteran Jim Cummings. The CGI was good and very meticulously done. It could give Toy Story some good competition. The sequels were decent, but I prefer the first one. There's even music by Smash Mouth and many fairy tale creatures and characters. Bottom line: if you're tired of usual and cliched fairy tales and want a strong female lead, this is your movie. See it!

I love this movie i watch it ever day teh soundtrack is so good i know the script.
This movie butters my apricots and waters my toast. i named my firstborn son Shrek and he is depressed but then he watch shrek all the day and now he happy and also happy is he. my dream is to meet shrek one day and hopefulllly that day is soon. my dog is not a dog he is a donkay. i dont have a dog so actually it is pretty cool so now i have a donkay and not an dog.

How dare you triflin a** b**** give this master piece a 7.8/10 rating. if you give this anything less than 9 stars, we can fight in the taco bell parking lot

Shrek is a green ogre who lives in a swamp, but his king sends him on a mission which he must complete to get his own land back.You only have to watch ten minutes of this film to realise that this is going to be a classic. Eddie Murphy being employed as a wisecracking donkey was a casting dream and plays well against the more plain Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers. Ok the plot is old, new, borrowed and blue (all recaps and references to fairy tales), but I don't care. It is all so much good fun and better than that, the kind of thing that can be enjoyed by young and old, male or female. It is really a dream of movie and some brilliant pop tunes are employed that really work fantastically against the images. Real tear-to-the-eye stuff.A real bliss-out of a movie and all parties should be congratulated for making it so great. A real DVD buyer, because it can be enjoyed over and over again. Bring on the follow up, I can't wait.

Shrek is one hell of an animated ride, and right when you're certain you know where to expect the next gag it one ups you. If you need a reason to see Shrek, here is that reason: imagine Eddie Murphy as an annoying not to mention obnoxious talking donkey. Yeah. Eddie Murphy gives Robin Williams a serious run for his money in terms of greatest animated side kick. From there we get Mike Myers voicing a big green ogre, who plays off Eddie Murphy with perfect comedic timing like the two were meant to do this film together. Shrek is merciless in its humor. Targeting everything from fairy tales to Disney films to narrative clichés to bad puns, sliding in its own commentary, all the while giving the typical fantasy story a few modern twists and turns to deliver a strangely original unoriginal story with original unoriginal characters . . . that doesn't make sense, but Shrek does, does it well, and doesn't care. And you never know where this humor is going to come from, either  either visual gag, musical nod, or spoken dialogue. All three provide their share of narrative and commentary to the concepts in Shrek. I think the beauty of Shrek is it's taken the typical fairy tale (which all of us have heard), and it answers the silly 'what if . . .' and 'why don't they ever . . .' questions we tend to ask. But that's not the core of the story - the core of this story is the friendship between Shrek and Donkey, which works in a funny goofball, but touching and unique way. If the audience can buy into Shrek and Donkey's relationship to one another, then they can believe entire film (which more or less focuses on the adventure the two share together). True, Shrek has a love theme . . . but it's Donkey and Shrek who sustain the film through most of the picture. As for Cameran Diaz and John Lithgow, while not on screen as much as our two heroes, still play an important role. I wouldn't want to downplay Lithgow and Diaz who do bring their respective characters to life, but Shrek is a tale about an enduring friendship with a romance story on the side.

Once upon a time - not too long ago - a writer had an idea to write a fairy tale made up of various fairy tale characters. And thus, a franchise was born.You can't help but love 'Shrek' - the character and the film. Shrek is one of the most unconventional yet most lovable characters seen in an animated film in a while. His sidekick, Donkey, almost steals the show thanks to his witty dialogue and FANTASTIC voicing by Eddie Murphy. He's just adorable!Together, they embark on a dangerous and exciting journey to save a princess, but for very different reasons you might think. They have absolutely no interest in the princess whatsoever - or, at least, that's what Shrek thought...'Shrek' is a delightful and very funny action adventure film, with several underlying messages. Children will adore the film for its characters and funny moments, while the film will also appeal to a mature audience on a deeper level, which children wont really understand.This is a very clever, excellently executed script. The inclusion of the song 'Hallelujah' was just awesome, and very appropriate. And what a beautiful ending - the stuff fairy tales are made of!! I love it!'Shrek' was a huge box office sensation, earning $506 million on a $60 million budget. It also raked in 99 award nominations, winning 39, including an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. This is a classic!Would I watch it again? Absolutely.

I saw this movie at a screening recently.  It was a delightful movie with something for everyone.  I think it will be as big a hit as "Toy Story I and II."  The computer animation is so realistic that it is great to watch. The donkey with Eddie Murphy's voice is a real crowd pleaser.  All in all, a winner!

I can't even write a review to do this movie justice. In order to appease Shrek and not to offend him I will say only this: Shrek is Love. Shrek is Life.

The movie Shrek created in 2001 was definitely one of dream works more eye opening children's films. It is filled with hilarious components for children but also there are some more adult jokes snuck in. I am not sure I am the only one that noticed this but when Lord Farquad tells the mirror to show him a picture of Fiona again, while laying shirtless in bed. He lifts the blanket and casually looks under it. This seems to suggest something is happening in this scene. If you know what I mean.
It has all the parts for an inclusive movie. And the surprising part of the story line that has to do with Fiona is most certainly unexpected and makes the story most not ordinary. When watching this keep in mind that this is not a normal fairy tale.
On the more negative side of things was how the story moved. Throughout the movie everything is very fast pace. The story just being set up, has far too many unnecessary components. This makes the time spent on the more important parts of the story shortened and rushed. And frankly it makes it a little repetitive since it's just one extravagant part of the journey after another. It's almost exhausting.

Shrek is a movie like no other.  It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is "She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy."  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp "farting," that amuses children.  The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations. Shrek has something for everyone; it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike.

I'm an old dude, 75 to be exact, and in my working days I was everything from a mainframe programmer to a HiTech startup Tech Admin. This sentence is here only to show why I am interested in the productions of Dreamworks and, of course, Pixar. Coming from a computer background permits me to be very, very impressed with the wonderful skill and creativity that go into making movies such as Shreck.Now then: The movie itself is marvelous! The characters are gentle and funny; there is no gratuitous violence; there are innuendos, of course, but skillfully done in a way that the "libretto" if you will can be "read" at least two levels. The story line itself is charming, and the ending is a real, nifty surprise!I add here that I've watched this with my younger G_Kids, who loved it; and also with my bride of fifty years, who loved it.It is in all ways in a class with the best that Mr. Jobs has so far produced, which is saying a great deal.HIGHLY recommended as good, funny, charming entertainment for a whole bunch of ages.Nick Fortis Los Altos California

For younger viewers, they might not understand the impact of "Shrek" on the film industry and CGI movies. However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film's appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn't quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.I could easily say more but this film has over a thousand reviews....so I'll just end it here!

Shrek is a wonderful parody of every fairytale story that you can think of, for the kids it has charm, humour and tons of fun, and is a delightful film for them to enjoy. In addition, Shrek has plenty of subtle innuendo and more adult themes running seamlessly along side the story, much of which may pass younger children by, without spoiling any element of their enjoyment; while at the same time enhancing the enjoyment for the older viewers.Shrek is simply so well created that it can successfully appeal to a huge audience excellently voiced as it is, by Mike Myers, John Lithgow, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy.Brilliant characters, solid script and hilarious parody, make this film a simply wonderful achievement, and that's without mentioning the awesome computer generated world that houses it.9/10

This movie really confronts the problems with society, such as the opioid crisis, domestic abuse, and donkey mistreatment head-on. It was a great way to talk about these issues with my teenage son.

A movie suitable for children, but really made for an adult audience. It's funny, has many quotable catchphrases and teaches us so much. It shows us that love has no limits, that you can find love where you'd least expect it and that beauty doesn't show only on the outside. It is also a great story about unlikely characters forming friendships that will last a lifetime.

The originality of this cinematic masterpiece is striking, as it exxxpertly blends layers of popular Indo-European fairytale culture with a creative, meaningful yet comedic story of discrimination, valour, love and lust for power.Ogreall, it is a true must-watch for fairytale fanatics of all ages.You are what you eat.

Shrek has hidden messages that will likely sail right over the heads of its target audience. The resettlement of the fairly tale creatures in the villainous Farquaad's (ruthless and cruel Anglo-Saxon) kingdom is an allusion to the resettlement of Jews in ghettos carried out by many European principalities during the Middle Ages (at the time of Martin Luther, I think they were expelled from England, France and Spain but tolerated, with restrictions, in some German city states). The filmmakers seem to be suggesting that just as Farquaad did not appreciate the fairy tale creatures and their magical and unique abilities and may have in fact been afraid of them, so, too, were Europeans afraid of Jews and their foreign culture and thus unjustly persecuted them. Apparently, all for no good reason. Shrek, the ogre, of course, represents how the African would have been received in medieval European society. He is feared and misunderstood as a stupid, grotesque, and violent menace. Of course, we are shown that in his private moments, he is anything but these undesirable qualities and his moral fibre transcends his physical ugliness. The fact that the fair princess Fiona is revealed to really be an ogress is to confirm that well worn cliché that we are all the same inside. In a classic fairy tale, which Shrek is the antithesis of, written by someone like Hans Christian Anderson for instance, Farquaad would be the hero, Shrek the villain, and Fiona would indeed be the fairest maiden in all the land.

This is a PG movie aimed for the G audience.  It is funny, and a good story, with some cleverness tucked here and there, but hovers just above the heads of the kids toward which animated movies should be aimed.  I took my kids to see this, since they had seen so many commercials on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, and we had the toys from Burger King, so obviously the people behind this movie thought that it was for kids, but the language was too Eddie Murphy-ish for younger children.  I recommend against taking children under ten to see this movie.

How dare you triflin a** b**** give this master piece a 7.8/10 rating. if you give this anything less than 9 stars, we can fight in the taco bell parking lot

Shrek is a green ogre who lives in a swamp, but his king sends him on a mission which he must complete to get his own land back.You only have to watch ten minutes of this film to realise that this is going to be a classic. Eddie Murphy being employed as a wisecracking donkey was a casting dream and plays well against the more plain Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers. Ok the plot is old, new, borrowed and blue (all recaps and references to fairy tales), but I don't care. It is all so much good fun and better than that, the kind of thing that can be enjoyed by young and old, male or female. It is really a dream of movie and some brilliant pop tunes are employed that really work fantastically against the images. Real tear-to-the-eye stuff.A real bliss-out of a movie and all parties should be congratulated for making it so great. A real DVD buyer, because it can be enjoyed over and over again. Bring on the follow up, I can't wait.

The Simpsons has been one of my favorite TV shows, and for the same reason that I like the Simpsons is what makes Shrek so good. The Simpsons takes the children-only medium of cartoons and makes an adult show out of it, with jokes in it that only adults will find amusing, some for adult eyes' only. Shrek is animation, a beautiful computer animation that looks realistic and bold, has enough kiddy humor in it to make the kids like it, but has even more jokes that adults will love. It's the cross between childhood innocence and adult knowledge that brings Shrek so many laughs. Mike Myers supplies the voice of Shrek, an ogre who enjoys living by himself in his swamp on the outskirt of Duloc, a near-perfect kingdom ran by the insecure Lord Farquaad, voice with wonderful swarmy-ness by John Lithgow. When Farquaad begins to deposit all of the mythical creatures that populate his kingdom into Shrek's swamp, Shrek demands to see the king, and only the smart-ass Donkey knows the way. Donkey is a sassy talking, well, donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy and is the Lou Costello to Shrek's Bud Abbot--to say Shrek is the straight man in this odd couple is an understatement. After meeting the king, Shrek and Donkey then have a quest of finding Fraquaad Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an imprisoned lady guarded by a dragon. I personally would have gone with Snow White, but to each their own. What also sets Shrek apart from other animated movies is the music, mostly rock music, mostly from Smashmouth. I do not think a Disney picture would have made the same selections. It gives it a different feel from the usual animated fare, Shrek for sure has it's own identity. Getting back to the animation, the computer generated scenery and characters are great to look at, very lifelike, even the human beings. Pixar, who has made films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, has made it clear that human beings are the most difficult objects to animate on computers, but I think DreamWorks got it right in Shrek--there is nothing there that makes me say "that does not look right." There are great in-jokes about the world of childhood stories, while sprinkling in some very adult humor. The best sight gags for me revolve around Farquaad interrogating a gingerbread man and threatening a magic mirror. Shrek will entertain and amuse the young and old alike.

I don't think humanity will ever create something that surpasses Shrek.

Shrek is one hell of an animated ride, and right when you're certain you know where to expect the next gag it one ups you. If you need a reason to see Shrek, here is that reason: imagine Eddie Murphy as an annoying not to mention obnoxious talking donkey. Yeah. Eddie Murphy gives Robin Williams a serious run for his money in terms of greatest animated side kick. From there we get Mike Myers voicing a big green ogre, who plays off Eddie Murphy with perfect comedic timing like the two were meant to do this film together. Shrek is merciless in its humor. Targeting everything from fairy tales to Disney films to narrative clichés to bad puns, sliding in its own commentary, all the while giving the typical fantasy story a few modern twists and turns to deliver a strangely original unoriginal story with original unoriginal characters . . . that doesn't make sense, but Shrek does, does it well, and doesn't care. And you never know where this humor is going to come from, either  either visual gag, musical nod, or spoken dialogue. All three provide their share of narrative and commentary to the concepts in Shrek. I think the beauty of Shrek is it's taken the typical fairy tale (which all of us have heard), and it answers the silly 'what if . . .' and 'why don't they ever . . .' questions we tend to ask. But that's not the core of the story - the core of this story is the friendship between Shrek and Donkey, which works in a funny goofball, but touching and unique way. If the audience can buy into Shrek and Donkey's relationship to one another, then they can believe entire film (which more or less focuses on the adventure the two share together). True, Shrek has a love theme . . . but it's Donkey and Shrek who sustain the film through most of the picture. As for Cameran Diaz and John Lithgow, while not on screen as much as our two heroes, still play an important role. I wouldn't want to downplay Lithgow and Diaz who do bring their respective characters to life, but Shrek is a tale about an enduring friendship with a romance story on the side.

I saw this movie at a screening recently.  It was a delightful movie with something for everyone.  I think it will be as big a hit as "Toy Story I and II."  The computer animation is so realistic that it is great to watch. The donkey with Eddie Murphy's voice is a real crowd pleaser.  All in all, a winner!

Once upon a time - not too long ago - a writer had an idea to write a fairy tale made up of various fairy tale characters. And thus, a franchise was born.You can't help but love 'Shrek' - the character and the film. Shrek is one of the most unconventional yet most lovable characters seen in an animated film in a while. His sidekick, Donkey, almost steals the show thanks to his witty dialogue and FANTASTIC voicing by Eddie Murphy. He's just adorable!Together, they embark on a dangerous and exciting journey to save a princess, but for very different reasons you might think. They have absolutely no interest in the princess whatsoever - or, at least, that's what Shrek thought...'Shrek' is a delightful and very funny action adventure film, with several underlying messages. Children will adore the film for its characters and funny moments, while the film will also appeal to a mature audience on a deeper level, which children wont really understand.This is a very clever, excellently executed script. The inclusion of the song 'Hallelujah' was just awesome, and very appropriate. And what a beautiful ending - the stuff fairy tales are made of!! I love it!'Shrek' was a huge box office sensation, earning $506 million on a $60 million budget. It also raked in 99 award nominations, winning 39, including an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. This is a classic!Would I watch it again? Absolutely.

I can't even write a review to do this movie justice. In order to appease Shrek and not to offend him I will say only this: Shrek is Love. Shrek is Life.

The movie Shrek created in 2001 was definitely one of dream works more eye opening children's films. It is filled with hilarious components for children but also there are some more adult jokes snuck in. I am not sure I am the only one that noticed this but when Lord Farquad tells the mirror to show him a picture of Fiona again, while laying shirtless in bed. He lifts the blanket and casually looks under it. This seems to suggest something is happening in this scene. If you know what I mean.
It has all the parts for an inclusive movie. And the surprising part of the story line that has to do with Fiona is most certainly unexpected and makes the story most not ordinary. When watching this keep in mind that this is not a normal fairy tale.
On the more negative side of things was how the story moved. Throughout the movie everything is very fast pace. The story just being set up, has far too many unnecessary components. This makes the time spent on the more important parts of the story shortened and rushed. And frankly it makes it a little repetitive since it's just one extravagant part of the journey after another. It's almost exhausting.

Before getting around to viewing Shrek, I waited until much of the hype and product tie-ins faded. (This took a bit of time. Luckily, I was able to see Final Fantasy and Monsters, Inc.) On the surface, it seemed to have the potential to stand out in a less-than-exciting year. The films creators assembled a core of quality actors to provide voices, the music sounded familiar, it looked like the animation was top notch, and it even had a catchy name. I have to say I was mostly disappointed. Mostly. Shrek attempted to work on many levels at once, but as usually happens with films that try to be all things to all people, it was never able to sustain any momentum. It seemed to randomly appease parts of its target audience. There also were major shifts in plot direction during the course of the film. The plot was simplistic and predictable, the characters under-developed and disposable, and the music placement questionable at best. It's as if they amassed several of the basic elements that create good films, threw them into a giant pot, and hoped the stew tasted good. I'd hate to think that this much effort was wasted.This being said, I suppose it was the best animated-parody-comedy-musical-romance-action-fantasy-parable-family movie of the year. I guess it was unfair to see a Simpsons episode prior to viewing. I am glad, however, that it was the greatest film many people have ever seen. Quite a Blockbuster moment to be sure.

Shrek is a movie like no other.  It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is "She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy."  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp "farting," that amuses children.  The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations. Shrek has something for everyone; it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike.
