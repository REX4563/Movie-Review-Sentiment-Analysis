Paul Conroy (played by Ryan Reynolds) awakes to find himself in a wooden box, buried underground. He is a civilian contractor and truck-driver in Iraq. His convoy was ambushed and he was taken captive and buried alive. He has a limited amount of air, giving him a limited time to find a way out. All he has to aid him in this task is his cigarette lighter, a torch, a mobile phone and his will to live.Minimalist yet highly original, intriguing and tension-filled.Probably the most minimalist movie ever made. The entire movie is filmed inside a wooden box, a wooden box with one occupant (well, one human occupant...). One actor - Ryan Reynolds - has 100% of the screen time, though there are voices of other actors involved.Incredibly engrossing and tension-filled. Until the very last moment you don't know how things are going to work out. Director Rodrigo Cortes and writer Chris Sparling keep you on tenterhooks throughout, teasing you with thoughts of one survival option being more likely than the other.Shows you don't need a big budget to make a great movie.

Buried seems to be a very divisive film. I'm seeing lots of 1 star reviews, and lots of 8-10 star reviews.**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**I won't rehash the plot, as every other review seems to. I will say that the movie is extremely taut, claustrophobic, well-paced and tense, and that at every step you will believe that this man - who has woken up buried alive - is desperate to survive and is trying to come up with a possibility of escape.The reason that this movie is getting so many 1 star reviews is because it is REALISTIC. Yes, REALISTIC.I imagine most of the reviewers giving it low scores are viewers who don't yet have the maturity to face up to a hopeless situation. Most movies these days give the hero impossible odds to overcome, and he DOES overcome them... because it's a movie. In real life impossible odds means that you fail, you lose. Say goodbye.Well, the odds are impossible in this movie. The main character wakes up in a box with almost zero mobility. The air supply is limited. He has only a lighter and a mobile phone (initially). He is in a foreign country, with no knowledge of his precise location. It is a nightmare situation. The odds are practically impossible. Yet we do believe that survival is possible. No, we almost DEMAND it. We hope and we pray that he will get out of that box. We empathise completely with his situation, but we believe there must be a way out.And that is why the movie is garnering such a mixed response. He doesn't get out. It was doomed from the start. He's been put in there by men who don't give a damn whether he survives or not. By men who've killed other innocent people and will continue to do so because their country is war torn and they are angry and desperate. His only hope is the US government and a hostage working group, whom he communicates with by phone. Every conversation is an exchange of information, with Reynolds's character offering whatever information he can in exchange for vague promises of help, and the various people on the other end of the phone having their own agendas and needs. But ultimately what can they do? His location is unknown and his phone is untraceable. They're looking for a needle in a dusty haystack. He can't get himself out and they can't find him to get him out.Read all of the 1 star reviews for comments like "why didn't the guy just use the knife to dig himself out?" and "he wastes oxygen using the zippo for light, what an idiot". He doesn't use the knife because every crack in the box lets sand in, and without the manoeuvrability to stand up, he would increase the speed at which he is buried. Remember, he cannot sit up, reach past his thighs, or even lift his head all the way up. And he uses the zippo for light because the alternative is to save oxygen while sitting there in the dark waiting for death. Action requires the use of resources, but only action gives the hope for success. Everyone seems to criticise his actions but I haven't yet seen a plausible escape plan offered up. If you're the type of person who thinks that if you were buried alive you would simply one-inch-punch your way out Kill Bill style then you're not going to like Buried. It's as simple as that, because your solution is fantasy and you will have no interest in seeing how such a situation would actually play out.This movie is about THE CHARACTER's choices. It's about what HE chooses to do for survival. If the viewer has the wisdom to accept the reality of the situation presented, and the understanding that this isn't some safe video game puzzle but rather a man's struggle to not die alone in a box somewhere in Iraq then they will find this movie hauntingly powerful.If you only want happy endings and the overcoming of impossible odds then you will probably hate this film. It will upset your delicate notion that life is sparkly and everything works out for the best. You will probably give it 1 star and explain how you would have killed the snake, cut off it's tail and used it as a hose to breathe through. But one thing's for sure: it will get under your skin and it will evoke a REACTION from you. And isn't that what good cinema is about anyway? See this film. You might hate it. But at least it will make you THINK.

I don't think I've seen a film quite like Buried before. It had me hooked from the onset, and built towards a really shocking and thrilling conclusion. I really enjoyed the story and thought that it maintained a great pace, which is vital for a film of this genre. There were maybe a few moments where things drifted off course, but for the most part it was solid.Ryan Reynolds was great, which is handy considering he was essentially the sole performer in the film. For large parts of the film he had no dialogue, so he brought his A game in terms of his physical performance.The camera work was very accomplished, managing to capture the claustrophobic environment without limiting the way the film looked.A very solid and enjoyable thriller. Nothing truly amazing, but very entertaining and intriguing!

Here is the proof that an intelligent movie can also be done with a low budget. The Spanish director Rodrigo Cortes mixed every element with a good balance into an interesting, never boring tense thriller. The end was very surprising and unexpected. I don't want to give more details here. Just watch it. I bought the DVD very cheap. Ryan Reynolds delivered a very respectable performance. The running time with 91 minutes was perfect. Buried is not based on true events but it is not far away from the reality.My expectations have been met. Even my wife had her doubts before but then she looked it with high attention. At the end we gave both a solid rating of 7/10.

When this movie started and the opening credits began, it was in parallel with Hitchcock movies, almost a replica of the Psycho opening sequence. It was fairly obvious that the director has been inspired by the Master of Macabre.I was intrigued for the entire 90 minutes of the movie, and although there were a couple of scenes that I was unsure about, it was still well worth watching. Ryan Reynolds is believable as a man buried alive in a coffin, and you can really feel the emotions he experiences during the movie. There is some wonderful conversations he has on the phone, in particular when he speaks to his mother.Just as you think that nothing more can happen, a surprise twist occurs which makes you want to stay and see if he will or will not survive. The ending was a surprise to me.Like Phone Booth and Man On A Ledge, both I have only seen recently, I had to watch this to it's full conclusion, and I did enjoy it.

Well somebody, somewhere, thought this was a good idea for a movie treatment. Having only seen Ryan Reynolds in super-hero flicks (Green Lantern, Deadpool), I wasn't sure how he'd do in this story about a guy stuck in and buried in a coffin in the middle of the Iraqi desert. For about ninety five minutes you have to live and experience Paul Conroy's (Reynolds) desperate attempt to find a way out while the terrorist who's holding him hostage underground demands payment in exchange for his life and that of his fiancee in the outside world. If you have claustrophobia, you might have a little problem with this picture; besides the confined space it's mostly dark except for what light is provided by a cigarette lighter. With a cell phone left behind by the man who imprisoned him, Conroy does his best with limited means to think outside the box and call anyone who might be able to offer help. The twist ending suggests this story might have better been served in a slightly shortened format appearing in a venue like the 'Twilight Zone', or on second thought, make that 'Tales From the Crypt'.

What would you do if you were trapped in a box? A coffin to be more precise. In Iraq. With a mobile phone.
Make a few calls.
Great premise. Man's inhumanity to man is vividly on display here.
Uncomfortable to watch. Uncomfortable to be in the box. Uncomfortable ending.
Original and intense.

1. Seeing what a good actor Ryan Reynolds is in this movie is what made me excited for Deadpool. He is literally the only actor in the movie, and he is confined to a box approximately seven by four feet. That's the entire movie, for ninety minutes. And I could not look away.2. The opening scenes are frightening. Those off-centre shots of his terrified face, frozen as the light vanishes as soon as it appears are somewhat reminiscent of a horror movie like The Blair Witch Project.3. The way the light illuminates the screen creates an intensity in itself, as Paul's small sources of light go through their degrees of reliability are frightening, especially with Paul's heavy breathing in the darkness reminding us that things go on even when we can't see them.4. The screenplay's dialogue is flawless. Paul is disoriented in his panic, as would be anyone in the situation, but rather than delaying the story it actually creates the atmosphere even more. The unhelpful conversations as Paul tries to contact them make you frustrated just as Rodrigo Cortes continues to stifle you with the sense of claustrophobia.5. The most frightening thing about Buried is that its entirely believable. Movies like The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield are scary because "what if" but a movie like Buried would be a nightmare for anyone who has ever spent time in the Middle East.6. That ending will straight up rip you in half.7. There needs to be more movies like Buried.

Original and ingeniously basic premise full of suspense and intrigue in spite of developing only one scenario. Paul (Ryan Reynolds) is an U.S. truck driver working in Iraq . After an attack by a group of Iraqis he wakes up to find he is buried alive inside a coffin. He encounters within the coffin a working phone, which allows him contact with the outside world. With only a lighter and a cellphone it's a race against time to getaway this claustrophobic death trap . Paul must rely on his owns resources to survive , taking on serpent and burying .This freaky and clever film chronicles fear ,desperation, paranoia of a kidnapped trucker in Iraq who faces off a completely Kafkaesque situation . This is a thrilling film in which the abducted starring quest to find answers and solutions to why he's imprisoned and getting freedom . The buried trucker very well performed by Ryan Reynolds works utilizing his skills and talents to survive the deadly trap which guard the coffin with serpent and falling down included , as using his intelligence he attempts to avoid get smashed because the coffin is caving itself in .The picture succeeds because the thriller, tension , as well as a superbly written script delving into the human psyche in such extreme situation and our instinctive urges for survival . Despite low budget the picture manages to be intelligent, intriguing and thrilling. The good thing about this film is that the director made it on a shoestring budget only having to do one set , yet the movie works on many levels but is constantly reconfigured . The trucker contacts by means of cellular phone with the outside world asking for help various characters , they are played -voices-by prestigious American secondaries as Stephen Tobolowski , Kali Rocha and Erik Palladino ; furthermore Samantha Mathis who plays another hostage .The interesting plot bears special resemblance to 'The cube' and ¨Fermat's room¨ but also there's a dangerously premise with strangers closed attempting to find an exit to exasperating situations. Good musical score fitting to tension by Victor Reyes who is also film producer . Fine cinematography , and naturally , plenty of dark and shades by Eduard Grau . The motion picture is originally directed by Rodrigo Cortes . Rating : Good , better than average .

Buried is a film that keeps things deadly simple, one character, one location and a one line but horribly inspired plot, those looking for flashy visuals or big action should turn far, far away from this one. It's worth noting though that the film is well directed and photographed, director Rodrigo Cortes has a nimble eye for visuals and angles to keep things visually interesting, while cinematographer Eduard Grau gets the best out of the mere two light sources to make the experience a frighteningly vivid one. The plot sees Ryan Reynolds waking up in a coffin, with nothing more than a cell-phone and his lighter to help him out, things develop through his series of fraught, occasionally bleakly amusing and increasingly desperate communications with the outside world. Its rather interesting to see a film so based around interactions on a mobile phone, devices so often objects of fear, suspicion, or in the case of some horror films and of course the cinematic experience for the viewer, irritations. Here every ring is crucial, the battery bar is nail-biting, even the light of the screen is important. For me, just as interesting was the choice of lead. I've never had time for Ryan Reynolds, a face from some of the worst in lowbrow comedy and someone I never expected to appreciate breaking through into not just serious film but something as bold in its structure as this. A lot of people are likely to dislike the film on a fundamental level, but Reynolds gives the performance of his life here, running through a rainbow of emotions, angry, sarcastic and terrified are but a few. Compelling and sympathetic, likely physically arduous too (though I'd don't know how the film was made it must have been tough, barring serious trickery) he holds the film wonderfully. The script is of course of utmost importance too, and writer Chris Sparling does mostly terrific work. An ordinary man reacting as best he can to a nightmare, drawing on the sort of resourcefulness he probably hoped he'd never need, occasionally breaking down but keeping ploughing on, shades of dark humour in the protagonist's travails on the phone, its endlessly interesting and as time goes on, nail-bitingly suspenseful. I had minor issues with realism in the film, and there was at least one interesting little aside that could have been developed a bit more, but overall this is a great achievement. It surely won't appeal to everyone and my rating might seem generous, but for doing this well on such a risky concept, and putting together a suspenser that remains thought provoking after, a 9/10 from me.

In 2006, the American truck driver Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds), who was hired by the CRT contractor to work delivering supplies in Iraq, awakes buried alive inside a coffin in the Iraq desert. He recalls that his convoy had been attacked by rebels about two hours ago and finds a cell phone, a flashlight and his lighter inside the box. Paul unsuccessfully tries to contact authorities in CRT, FBI and state department office to disclose his situation, but he finds bureaucracy or absent people. Then he tries to reach his wife Linda, but she does not answer the phone. Out of the blue, one abductor contacts him asking a 5 million-dollar ransom and a video reading a note that is also inside the coffin. Paul realizes that the oxygen is running out and he does not have much time to survive. When he is contacted by the specialist in abduction Dan Brenner, Paul has high hopes to tracked by Dan and found in time. "Buried" is a claustrophobic and tense thriller with only one character and location and practically in real time. The plot uses a storyline similar to "Phone Booth" with a man trapped alone in a box having only a phone to contact the outside world, but in a pitch black with flashes of the location instead; therefore scarier than inside a phone booth. The viewer does not know exactly what is happening, and learns through the dialogs of the character. Ryan Reynolds has a great performance and succeeds in keeping the attention of the viewer along 95 minutes running time. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Enterrado Vivo" ("Buried Alive")

In 90 mins, you will see how fast this Blackberry battery goes, and how stupid Paul is trying to get himself out from the coffin.Okay, this is probably a man's worst nightmare - buried alive. But in this movie, no fancy story behind, but just about war, terrorists, govt, etc. The most boring boring boring element.So here we goes, with a phone that actually have reception, a zippo lighter, a knife, there are lots of ways to try to get himself out, but in every ways he does, he did it the wrong way.Now I think even an idiot knows we need oxygen to stay alive, and in this case, our Paul seems to think there are actually too much oxygen for him, so he decided to light up the zippo and burn as much as oxygen every time he make a stupid phone call!!!! COME ON PAUL!!! I don't see Paul is getting smart but with a phone he probably could just call anyone that able to help him. But he chose to trust the US Govt. Alright, that's your call Paul, but when his company, FBI and whatever dealing-with-hostage-expert cannot help, Paul, You'd better think of something better.Here is my favorite part, a fxxking snake came from no where, suddenly appear in Paul's pants and then get out. Okay, I can live with that, becoz when a snake could get in, and Paul have a knife, he could probably at least try to break the coffin and dig his way out! Nah, our Paul still think he has enough oxygen and let's burn the snake heck out! Blah blah blah that with that lawsuit phone call from his company, what the hell??? There are ways to make Paul desperate but this part is just a really sick cheap shot!!!! I don't really see how Paul is getting himself out, but just watching him die every minute closer.Some people might think they not gonna buy a blackberry phone becoz the battery run out in 90 mins. =p Some people might think Paul might get out and let's see how he do it. But no, he is dead becoz he's stupid.Some people might think what the heck, I just want to watch a movie for fun... OOPS, "Buried" is not fun either.So that's it, there's no way Paul could live, why don't we give a chance to some other movies?

The concept of this film is enough to engage – partly because it has the "one line" simplicity that can make for a great idea but also it poses the question, beyond how will Paul get out of his coffin, quite how are they going to make a 90 minute film out of one actor alone in the dark. This question is all the more relevant when one considers that, no offence, the "one actor" is Ryan Reynolds – who at times in other projects seemed like the only way he would be the best actor in a film was if he was the only actor in the film.All questions are answered though in this flawed film that is engaging in the concept even if some of the delivery is rather heavy-handed, political or just stretched. First and foremost the film is brave in holding to the central idea – it never leaves the coffin and it is well shot to create enough space for the viewer in there, but not to surrender the idea of how confined it all it. Opening with no dialogue and a dark screen for a long period of time is a good start and it mostly holds to this idea as the viewer is stuck with him and very aware of his desperation. This aspect is never done wrong. How to fill the time then? Well there is a mobile with limited battery and for the most part the action outside comes through here, with the film taking Paul through anger, pleading, hope, despair, hope again only to leave him with death and the viewer with a depressing but memorable ending. Again this as a journey is engaging and affecting – it is just how the film does it where the problems come in.The politicking feel to it is my first problem. OK it is not overly heavy (some of it could be explained away as creating tension or drama) but there is an air of condemnation for being in Iraq and a sense that perhaps we (Paul) were not fully prepared for the reality of it. Secondly there is a real heavy and unrealistic dig at Paul's employers as with his last bar of battery life (which seems to last longer than the other 80% of the battery) he is informed of his dismissal so the company can save money on insurance after his death; OK again it fills time and creates a feeling in the audience but it doesn't ring true and it seems heavily done. On a non-political side, the fire and the snake are a bit stretched but again they do create a bit of drama and fill time. The ending is harsh but effective as we have our hopes raised that the cavalry will literally save the day, only to have one last twist that will leave you feeling like you have been kicked in the stomach.Much to my surprise Reynolds does a great job. He holds the screen without having to rely on his good looks or body. Previously I have only really enjoyed him for his jock wit but here he had me convinced as he went through the cycle of fear, anger, pleading, acceptance and hope. It was a really great performance in a small indie film. Paterson's voice is well used, he sounds realistic and works well with Reynolds. Tobolowsky does sound like a man who sits behind a desk sees names as liabilities and cost rather than people.Overall Buried is a brave indie movie in concept but being "different" doesn't mean it is brilliant (I think some love it for what it is rather than what it does). The central idea is engaging and it is well enough executed to keep the viewer held even if some of the stuff that fills the time can be unconvincing or rather heavy-handed in terms of political comment.

I enjoyed watching Buried, even though I was disappointed and sad in not experiencing toward Buried a strong feeling of anxiety, fear, depression and breath running out of me. I didn't feel heart-pounded by this movie, nor did I think the movie was great and truly irresistible. The movie did make me a tiny bit anxious a few times during the watch though, and that's one thing, but not as much as I would have expected of course. One of the things I admired in Buried was its twists. I didn't expect most or any of these twists, but when I say I didn't expect them I actually mean to say that I completely didn't expect them. These twists are great and they will blow your mind. Believe me, you won't see them coming. When it comes to Ryan Reynolds, I think that his performance was unusually impressive and a performance worth remembering for at least a decade to come. I also like the fact that Ryan Reynolds's character is trying to get help in order to escape from the claustrophobic trap in which he is imprisoned, by calling on a phone he has with him, but as the movie continues on, Ryan Reynolds' character, instead, begins getting a call telling him of an inappropriate and illegal action from his own part inside his job, and that therefore, the people calling him and the people that have been trying to rescue him from the beginning, will not try to rescue him anymore and will leave him to his fate. I like it, because it adds more dramatic conflict --and originality-- to the plot. Other good things with this film include the fact that the movie starts right off the bat with Reynold's character having already been buried alive underground (someplace we don't know), rather than starting the film with what happened that led to his underground burial, because it makes the film more mysterious that way (and an efficient way to start a film as well), plus making Reynolds die at the end of the movie (through a surprising twist), rather than make him live in order to trick the audience's wish that he'll live, which is of course, artistic filmmaking. My rating for the movie is 7.0/10

I caught this gem at Sundance earlier in the year. It was part of the 'Park City at midnight' group of films, which showcased horror and thriller movies, and played them at, can you guess? Midnight. I saw Buried on the last night of the festival, Ryan Reynolds wasn't there, but both the director and writer were. It was a small theater on Main street, very artsy in it's look. But once the film started I had eyes only for the screen.It starts off with Ryan waking up, trapped in a box. A long box, the length of a human body, buried deep beneath the ground. From there the film plays out in an awe inspiring way, especially seeing as there's only so much you can reveal from one location. The way Rodrigo Cortes handled the filming is truly exceptional. From the start the camera switches between closely claustrophobic, and flying high above Ryan, showing the box with him inside and black all around. It's constantly on the move just like our main character's thoughts. Diving in when the action is intense, and then cutting to black when you don't think you can take any more.The pacing and plot of the film were nothing short of genius. And Chris Sparling, the writer, should be commended for his work. He said after the showing, that after having his scripts rejected for their cost of locations he decided to go for a cheep but genius idea. One location, one star, and a wealth of idea's. It makes a film like 'Salt' look like a giant waste of resources, when Buried does what even some of the best thrillers can't do, it brings us inside the character's head, and does it all without a romp through the city, or blowing things up.If you're one of those people who loves to sit on the edge of your seat, chewing at your fingernails, while you're constantly asking yourself what's going to happen next. Then by all means watch Buried, and consider yourself lucky that you're not in his shoes...

I hate it when fantastic movies such as this get completely overlooked when it comes time for awards to be handed out. Buried is a triumph in minimalist filmmaking and is a heart wrenchingly intense movie experience. It is gripping, moving, frustrating, and terrifying. Oh yeah, and it all takes place inside a box. Paul Conroy, who is played by Ryan Reynolds and is the only character in the movie we actually see, wakes up in a coffin buried under the ground with no idea how he got there or who put him there. He shortly finds out that he is being held by ransom by a group of terrorists in Iraq. With only a pen, a flask, a cell phone, and only 90 minutes of oxygen, Paul has to act fast. The movie limits itself to an astounding extent, but makes the most out of what it has, creating an incredibly thrilling experience.How much can you really expect from a movie that takes place in a human sized box with only one person? Buried delivers a lot more than you would expect from this scenario. It has all the right elements to make it as enthralling as any action film we see today. To start off, Rodrigo Cortes does a great job directing his limited space. He miraculously pulls off a lot of great shots and brilliant claustrophobic nuances. He directs with enough skill to keep the movie interesting in its entirety. The movie never felt lagged or drawn out and every moment where it would have slowed down it would throw a great twist or shocking moment that drew you right back in.Furthermore, the director does a lot of great artistic work with what little he to work with. We have to take into consideration the fact that when you are buried underground in a coffin, there is obviously zero light. Thankfully Paul has various light sources with him in the coffin. And so to keep from breaking the realism of the film, these light sources are the only light in the film, making sure all light is authentic. Paul's light sources include a lighter, a flashlight, a cell phone, and a green glow stick. Each of these light sources gives off a different color, and these colors which obviously encompass everything when they are present add to and reflect the mood of the film. When things are calmer (relatively of course) we are treated to the soft blue light of the cell phone. As things grow more suspenseful and harrowing we are treated to scenes lit by the green glow stick. And when things grow more sinister the red lens of the flashlight is used. I found these minute details fascinating and they artistically added a lot to a film which had little room to work with.While Cortes' directing gives the film plenty of life, Ryan Reynold's stalwart performance really drives the emotion of the film. He delivers a top notch performance, and he as to seeing as he is the only character in the film other than the various people he talks to on the phone which we never actually see. It can't be easy to carry a film all by yourself, but this year we were treated to two performances that did a superb job at it, the other of course being James Franco in 127 Hours.Buried is a film that Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of. It is a groundbreaking thriller that does so much with so little. It is such a harrowing movie experience that you cannot forget. All 90 minutes of this film are fascinating and gripping, especially the last fifteen. The final moments of the film are some of the most captivating and enthralling moments I've ever experienced through film. During the finale of the film you will want nothing more than to know the fate of Paul Conroy, and when you finally do learn his fate at the close of the film your jaw will drop and you will be utterly blown away by such a captivating on screen experience.

BURIED, a Spanish-made production with US backing and an American lead, is the latest in a long line of shot-in-a-single-location movies; other recent entries include PHONE BOOTH, 127 HOURS (trapped in a canyon) and DEVIL (shot in a lift). This one takes a more extreme approach to the premise than the others, as the entire film is set inside a coffin where a guy has been buried alive.For the most part, this is watchable drama and it's rarely boring, as you might expect given the premise. The writer has carefully worked everything out, so that there's incident at regular intervals (Reynolds has to contend with plenty of dangers, including sand and snakes) and dialogue thanks to the handy mobile phone he's been buried with.I'm no fan of Reynolds as an actor, but he acquits himself quite well with the material and gives a believable performance as a guy driven to desperation and the edge of his mind. The most impressive talent belongs to director Rodrigo Cortes, who manages to keep everything interesting despite the limitations of his story - it's a bravura job, and the ending nails it perfectly.

If this doesn't remain in my top five come year-end I will be shocked. Who thought that a movie can not only sustain a full 90mins stuck within the confines of a coffin (and believe me, it doesn't leave the coffin) but that it would be one of the most cinematic and audacious pieces of cinema I've seen in a good few years? Like this year's Inception and Toy Story 3, movies like Buried are the reason I love cinema. It is escapism at it's best, ironic considering the setting. Who thought Ryan Reynolds, Van Wilder: Party Liaison himself could be so utterly mesmerising in such a challenging role? The movie is literally his. Sure, there are those he speaks to over the phone (he's buried with a Zippo and a Blackberry) but for the film's length, he is the only physical presence on screen. He goes through every emotion possible: fear, panic, anger, sadness, happiness, depression, acceptance, and all of it played so convincingly that you almost wonder whether they genuinely buried the actor and left a camera in there with him.There are minor gripes, all predominantly found in the first half. It feels somewhat episodic at times and there's a lack of any real tension during the first forty minutes but this is a pressure cooker of a film and the last half is unrelenting to the point of nausea, culminating in a truly great finale that caused me to shout-out in the quiet, near empty cinema.Buried is extraordinary. The only performance to beat Reynolds' in recent years is Sam Rockwell's stunning turn in Moon. High concept thrillers like this rise or fall on the delivery of their challenging set ups. Fortunately, Buried works.It really, really works.

Playing a tense and anxious characters comes so naturally form Ryan Reynolds. His performance was the perfect example of a thought-provoking and seemingly-clueless and innocent character in such a brutal and surreal situation. This was one of the films out there that proved you didn't need an explosive and grand production to create such a lowkey great thriller. The cinematography and production was the magnificent standout for me. To create such a tense setting was a complicated concept to formulate, and yet this film did just that. Added with an explosive twist at the end, this was on its way to becoming a classic.

Buried (2010) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Effective thriller has Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) waking up in pure darkness and soon realizing that his convoy in Iraq was attacked by insurgents and now he is stuck inside a coffin without much time to live. He has a cell phone and a few other odds and ends and this here is really as much as you need to know in terms of story. BURIED is certainly unlike any other film that I can think of. Sure, there have been countless movies about being buried alive as the horror genre is full of such films but none of them actually put you in the coffin for 94-minutes and made you squirm like this thing does. It's interesting that the director and screenwriter decided to have every single second inside the coffin and I think this was a very wise choice. I think an uncomfortable filmmaker would have chickened out and not kept everything inside the coffin. There are several people that Paul calls throughout the movie trying to get help and I think a lot of people would have shown these other people but thankfully that doesn't happen here. I think the film works because as more and more time passes you begin to feel like Paul, as if you're trapped and by keeping you inside the coffin you never really get a chance to catch your breath. Every time Paul goes into shock so do you. Every time another issue comes up you can't help but feel his pain. Every single thing Paul feels in the movie is something the viewer is also feeling so it was very wise to keep everything in this small box. The amazing thing is that you'd think there wasn't too much you could do in such a small space but the screenplay offers up quite a few things that I won't ruin. I don't think anything came across as being faked or forced. The one problem I had with the film is that since we do spend the entire time in the box, it takes a few minutes to really warm up to Paul. Yes, we feel the dangers as soon as the film starts since it begins with him in danger but the suspense really starts after we become to know the guy, have feelings for him and wanting to see him get out of this situation. Reynolds is certainly one of the best actors working in movies today and it's a real shame that so many of his great performances aren't being seen by the masses. His performance here is another winner as he carries the entire film. Being trapped in a tight box without much room to move allows him to use facial gestures as well as other body movements. There's also a lot of work he has to do with his voice. The most impressive thing for me was just watching his eyes as we can see his fear, heartache and pain without him having to say a single word. The 2.35:1 framing allows some terrific shots but it also adds to the claustrophobic nature of the film. As more and more time passes you can't help but feel squeezed in just like the character and I must admit that there were a few times where I was holding my breath for so long that I ended up gasping for air. I won't ruin the final ten-minutes but they're certainly not for the weak hearted.

Paul Conroy (played by Ryan Reynolds) awakes to find himself in a wooden box, buried underground. He is a civilian contractor and truck-driver in Iraq. His convoy was ambushed and he was taken captive and buried alive. He has a limited amount of air, giving him a limited time to find a way out. All he has to aid him in this task is his cigarette lighter, a torch, a mobile phone and his will to live.Minimalist yet highly original, intriguing and tension-filled.Probably the most minimalist movie ever made. The entire movie is filmed inside a wooden box, a wooden box with one occupant (well, one human occupant...). One actor - Ryan Reynolds - has 100% of the screen time, though there are voices of other actors involved.Incredibly engrossing and tension-filled. Until the very last moment you don't know how things are going to work out. Director Rodrigo Cortes and writer Chris Sparling keep you on tenterhooks throughout, teasing you with thoughts of one survival option being more likely than the other.Shows you don't need a big budget to make a great movie.

Buried seems to be a very divisive film. I'm seeing lots of 1 star reviews, and lots of 8-10 star reviews.**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**I won't rehash the plot, as every other review seems to. I will say that the movie is extremely taut, claustrophobic, well-paced and tense, and that at every step you will believe that this man - who has woken up buried alive - is desperate to survive and is trying to come up with a possibility of escape.The reason that this movie is getting so many 1 star reviews is because it is REALISTIC. Yes, REALISTIC.I imagine most of the reviewers giving it low scores are viewers who don't yet have the maturity to face up to a hopeless situation. Most movies these days give the hero impossible odds to overcome, and he DOES overcome them... because it's a movie. In real life impossible odds means that you fail, you lose. Say goodbye.Well, the odds are impossible in this movie. The main character wakes up in a box with almost zero mobility. The air supply is limited. He has only a lighter and a mobile phone (initially). He is in a foreign country, with no knowledge of his precise location. It is a nightmare situation. The odds are practically impossible. Yet we do believe that survival is possible. No, we almost DEMAND it. We hope and we pray that he will get out of that box. We empathise completely with his situation, but we believe there must be a way out.And that is why the movie is garnering such a mixed response. He doesn't get out. It was doomed from the start. He's been put in there by men who don't give a damn whether he survives or not. By men who've killed other innocent people and will continue to do so because their country is war torn and they are angry and desperate. His only hope is the US government and a hostage working group, whom he communicates with by phone. Every conversation is an exchange of information, with Reynolds's character offering whatever information he can in exchange for vague promises of help, and the various people on the other end of the phone having their own agendas and needs. But ultimately what can they do? His location is unknown and his phone is untraceable. They're looking for a needle in a dusty haystack. He can't get himself out and they can't find him to get him out.Read all of the 1 star reviews for comments like "why didn't the guy just use the knife to dig himself out?" and "he wastes oxygen using the zippo for light, what an idiot". He doesn't use the knife because every crack in the box lets sand in, and without the manoeuvrability to stand up, he would increase the speed at which he is buried. Remember, he cannot sit up, reach past his thighs, or even lift his head all the way up. And he uses the zippo for light because the alternative is to save oxygen while sitting there in the dark waiting for death. Action requires the use of resources, but only action gives the hope for success. Everyone seems to criticise his actions but I haven't yet seen a plausible escape plan offered up. If you're the type of person who thinks that if you were buried alive you would simply one-inch-punch your way out Kill Bill style then you're not going to like Buried. It's as simple as that, because your solution is fantasy and you will have no interest in seeing how such a situation would actually play out.This movie is about THE CHARACTER's choices. It's about what HE chooses to do for survival. If the viewer has the wisdom to accept the reality of the situation presented, and the understanding that this isn't some safe video game puzzle but rather a man's struggle to not die alone in a box somewhere in Iraq then they will find this movie hauntingly powerful.If you only want happy endings and the overcoming of impossible odds then you will probably hate this film. It will upset your delicate notion that life is sparkly and everything works out for the best. You will probably give it 1 star and explain how you would have killed the snake, cut off it's tail and used it as a hose to breathe through. But one thing's for sure: it will get under your skin and it will evoke a REACTION from you. And isn't that what good cinema is about anyway? See this film. You might hate it. But at least it will make you THINK.

I don't think I've seen a film quite like Buried before. It had me hooked from the onset, and built towards a really shocking and thrilling conclusion. I really enjoyed the story and thought that it maintained a great pace, which is vital for a film of this genre. There were maybe a few moments where things drifted off course, but for the most part it was solid.Ryan Reynolds was great, which is handy considering he was essentially the sole performer in the film. For large parts of the film he had no dialogue, so he brought his A game in terms of his physical performance.The camera work was very accomplished, managing to capture the claustrophobic environment without limiting the way the film looked.A very solid and enjoyable thriller. Nothing truly amazing, but very entertaining and intriguing!

Here is the proof that an intelligent movie can also be done with a low budget. The Spanish director Rodrigo Cortes mixed every element with a good balance into an interesting, never boring tense thriller. The end was very surprising and unexpected. I don't want to give more details here. Just watch it. I bought the DVD very cheap. Ryan Reynolds delivered a very respectable performance. The running time with 91 minutes was perfect. Buried is not based on true events but it is not far away from the reality.My expectations have been met. Even my wife had her doubts before but then she looked it with high attention. At the end we gave both a solid rating of 7/10.

When this movie started and the opening credits began, it was in parallel with Hitchcock movies, almost a replica of the Psycho opening sequence. It was fairly obvious that the director has been inspired by the Master of Macabre.I was intrigued for the entire 90 minutes of the movie, and although there were a couple of scenes that I was unsure about, it was still well worth watching. Ryan Reynolds is believable as a man buried alive in a coffin, and you can really feel the emotions he experiences during the movie. There is some wonderful conversations he has on the phone, in particular when he speaks to his mother.Just as you think that nothing more can happen, a surprise twist occurs which makes you want to stay and see if he will or will not survive. The ending was a surprise to me.Like Phone Booth and Man On A Ledge, both I have only seen recently, I had to watch this to it's full conclusion, and I did enjoy it.

Well somebody, somewhere, thought this was a good idea for a movie treatment. Having only seen Ryan Reynolds in super-hero flicks (Green Lantern, Deadpool), I wasn't sure how he'd do in this story about a guy stuck in and buried in a coffin in the middle of the Iraqi desert. For about ninety five minutes you have to live and experience Paul Conroy's (Reynolds) desperate attempt to find a way out while the terrorist who's holding him hostage underground demands payment in exchange for his life and that of his fiancee in the outside world. If you have claustrophobia, you might have a little problem with this picture; besides the confined space it's mostly dark except for what light is provided by a cigarette lighter. With a cell phone left behind by the man who imprisoned him, Conroy does his best with limited means to think outside the box and call anyone who might be able to offer help. The twist ending suggests this story might have better been served in a slightly shortened format appearing in a venue like the 'Twilight Zone', or on second thought, make that 'Tales From the Crypt'.

What would you do if you were trapped in a box? A coffin to be more precise. In Iraq. With a mobile phone.
Make a few calls.
Great premise. Man's inhumanity to man is vividly on display here.
Uncomfortable to watch. Uncomfortable to be in the box. Uncomfortable ending.
Original and intense.

It's a bit hard to review this special movie. You can't go into special effects because there were non. You can't say anything about the cast because it's just one person you see. And the set is simple too, just a coffin. Yes, indeed, it all takes place in a coffin. So that's already tricky to watch because I know a lot of people who didn't liked it because there was nothing to see or watch and I must agree with them. It takes indeed almost an hour before the suspense comes in. The first hour you will learn everything about the character, perfectly played by Ryan Reynolds. But it's all done on phone. Of course, being buried you can't do anything else than phone but for me it was a bit too long, an hour as I said. But from then on it goes faster and things go from worse to terribly wrong. The ending was a surprise for me. I won't spoil it just watch it. Still, I won't state it as a horror either a suspense or thriller. But you have to experience the coffin setting to sit it through. Simple story, excellent camera tricks.

1. Seeing what a good actor Ryan Reynolds is in this movie is what made me excited for Deadpool. He is literally the only actor in the movie, and he is confined to a box approximately seven by four feet. That's the entire movie, for ninety minutes. And I could not look away.2. The opening scenes are frightening. Those off-centre shots of his terrified face, frozen as the light vanishes as soon as it appears are somewhat reminiscent of a horror movie like The Blair Witch Project.3. The way the light illuminates the screen creates an intensity in itself, as Paul's small sources of light go through their degrees of reliability are frightening, especially with Paul's heavy breathing in the darkness reminding us that things go on even when we can't see them.4. The screenplay's dialogue is flawless. Paul is disoriented in his panic, as would be anyone in the situation, but rather than delaying the story it actually creates the atmosphere even more. The unhelpful conversations as Paul tries to contact them make you frustrated just as Rodrigo Cortes continues to stifle you with the sense of claustrophobia.5. The most frightening thing about Buried is that its entirely believable. Movies like The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield are scary because "what if" but a movie like Buried would be a nightmare for anyone who has ever spent time in the Middle East.6. That ending will straight up rip you in half.7. There needs to be more movies like Buried.

Original and ingeniously basic premise full of suspense and intrigue in spite of developing only one scenario. Paul (Ryan Reynolds) is an U.S. truck driver working in Iraq . After an attack by a group of Iraqis he wakes up to find he is buried alive inside a coffin. He encounters within the coffin a working phone, which allows him contact with the outside world. With only a lighter and a cellphone it's a race against time to getaway this claustrophobic death trap . Paul must rely on his owns resources to survive , taking on serpent and burying .This freaky and clever film chronicles fear ,desperation, paranoia of a kidnapped trucker in Iraq who faces off a completely Kafkaesque situation . This is a thrilling film in which the abducted starring quest to find answers and solutions to why he's imprisoned and getting freedom . The buried trucker very well performed by Ryan Reynolds works utilizing his skills and talents to survive the deadly trap which guard the coffin with serpent and falling down included , as using his intelligence he attempts to avoid get smashed because the coffin is caving itself in .The picture succeeds because the thriller, tension , as well as a superbly written script delving into the human psyche in such extreme situation and our instinctive urges for survival . Despite low budget the picture manages to be intelligent, intriguing and thrilling. The good thing about this film is that the director made it on a shoestring budget only having to do one set , yet the movie works on many levels but is constantly reconfigured . The trucker contacts by means of cellular phone with the outside world asking for help various characters , they are played -voices-by prestigious American secondaries as Stephen Tobolowski , Kali Rocha and Erik Palladino ; furthermore Samantha Mathis who plays another hostage .The interesting plot bears special resemblance to 'The cube' and ¨Fermat's room¨ but also there's a dangerously premise with strangers closed attempting to find an exit to exasperating situations. Good musical score fitting to tension by Victor Reyes who is also film producer . Fine cinematography , and naturally , plenty of dark and shades by Eduard Grau . The motion picture is originally directed by Rodrigo Cortes . Rating : Good , better than average .

Buried is a film that keeps things deadly simple, one character, one location and a one line but horribly inspired plot, those looking for flashy visuals or big action should turn far, far away from this one. It's worth noting though that the film is well directed and photographed, director Rodrigo Cortes has a nimble eye for visuals and angles to keep things visually interesting, while cinematographer Eduard Grau gets the best out of the mere two light sources to make the experience a frighteningly vivid one. The plot sees Ryan Reynolds waking up in a coffin, with nothing more than a cell-phone and his lighter to help him out, things develop through his series of fraught, occasionally bleakly amusing and increasingly desperate communications with the outside world. Its rather interesting to see a film so based around interactions on a mobile phone, devices so often objects of fear, suspicion, or in the case of some horror films and of course the cinematic experience for the viewer, irritations. Here every ring is crucial, the battery bar is nail-biting, even the light of the screen is important. For me, just as interesting was the choice of lead. I've never had time for Ryan Reynolds, a face from some of the worst in lowbrow comedy and someone I never expected to appreciate breaking through into not just serious film but something as bold in its structure as this. A lot of people are likely to dislike the film on a fundamental level, but Reynolds gives the performance of his life here, running through a rainbow of emotions, angry, sarcastic and terrified are but a few. Compelling and sympathetic, likely physically arduous too (though I'd don't know how the film was made it must have been tough, barring serious trickery) he holds the film wonderfully. The script is of course of utmost importance too, and writer Chris Sparling does mostly terrific work. An ordinary man reacting as best he can to a nightmare, drawing on the sort of resourcefulness he probably hoped he'd never need, occasionally breaking down but keeping ploughing on, shades of dark humour in the protagonist's travails on the phone, its endlessly interesting and as time goes on, nail-bitingly suspenseful. I had minor issues with realism in the film, and there was at least one interesting little aside that could have been developed a bit more, but overall this is a great achievement. It surely won't appeal to everyone and my rating might seem generous, but for doing this well on such a risky concept, and putting together a suspenser that remains thought provoking after, a 9/10 from me.

In 2006, the American truck driver Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds), who was hired by the CRT contractor to work delivering supplies in Iraq, awakes buried alive inside a coffin in the Iraq desert. He recalls that his convoy had been attacked by rebels about two hours ago and finds a cell phone, a flashlight and his lighter inside the box. Paul unsuccessfully tries to contact authorities in CRT, FBI and state department office to disclose his situation, but he finds bureaucracy or absent people. Then he tries to reach his wife Linda, but she does not answer the phone. Out of the blue, one abductor contacts him asking a 5 million-dollar ransom and a video reading a note that is also inside the coffin. Paul realizes that the oxygen is running out and he does not have much time to survive. When he is contacted by the specialist in abduction Dan Brenner, Paul has high hopes to tracked by Dan and found in time. "Buried" is a claustrophobic and tense thriller with only one character and location and practically in real time. The plot uses a storyline similar to "Phone Booth" with a man trapped alone in a box having only a phone to contact the outside world, but in a pitch black with flashes of the location instead; therefore scarier than inside a phone booth. The viewer does not know exactly what is happening, and learns through the dialogs of the character. Ryan Reynolds has a great performance and succeeds in keeping the attention of the viewer along 95 minutes running time. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Enterrado Vivo" ("Buried Alive")

In 90 mins, you will see how fast this Blackberry battery goes, and how stupid Paul is trying to get himself out from the coffin.Okay, this is probably a man's worst nightmare - buried alive. But in this movie, no fancy story behind, but just about war, terrorists, govt, etc. The most boring boring boring element.So here we goes, with a phone that actually have reception, a zippo lighter, a knife, there are lots of ways to try to get himself out, but in every ways he does, he did it the wrong way.Now I think even an idiot knows we need oxygen to stay alive, and in this case, our Paul seems to think there are actually too much oxygen for him, so he decided to light up the zippo and burn as much as oxygen every time he make a stupid phone call!!!! COME ON PAUL!!! I don't see Paul is getting smart but with a phone he probably could just call anyone that able to help him. But he chose to trust the US Govt. Alright, that's your call Paul, but when his company, FBI and whatever dealing-with-hostage-expert cannot help, Paul, You'd better think of something better.Here is my favorite part, a fxxking snake came from no where, suddenly appear in Paul's pants and then get out. Okay, I can live with that, becoz when a snake could get in, and Paul have a knife, he could probably at least try to break the coffin and dig his way out! Nah, our Paul still think he has enough oxygen and let's burn the snake heck out! Blah blah blah that with that lawsuit phone call from his company, what the hell??? There are ways to make Paul desperate but this part is just a really sick cheap shot!!!! I don't really see how Paul is getting himself out, but just watching him die every minute closer.Some people might think they not gonna buy a blackberry phone becoz the battery run out in 90 mins. =p Some people might think Paul might get out and let's see how he do it. But no, he is dead becoz he's stupid.Some people might think what the heck, I just want to watch a movie for fun... OOPS, "Buried" is not fun either.So that's it, there's no way Paul could live, why don't we give a chance to some other movies?

The concept of this film is enough to engage – partly because it has the "one line" simplicity that can make for a great idea but also it poses the question, beyond how will Paul get out of his coffin, quite how are they going to make a 90 minute film out of one actor alone in the dark. This question is all the more relevant when one considers that, no offence, the "one actor" is Ryan Reynolds – who at times in other projects seemed like the only way he would be the best actor in a film was if he was the only actor in the film.All questions are answered though in this flawed film that is engaging in the concept even if some of the delivery is rather heavy-handed, political or just stretched. First and foremost the film is brave in holding to the central idea – it never leaves the coffin and it is well shot to create enough space for the viewer in there, but not to surrender the idea of how confined it all it. Opening with no dialogue and a dark screen for a long period of time is a good start and it mostly holds to this idea as the viewer is stuck with him and very aware of his desperation. This aspect is never done wrong. How to fill the time then? Well there is a mobile with limited battery and for the most part the action outside comes through here, with the film taking Paul through anger, pleading, hope, despair, hope again only to leave him with death and the viewer with a depressing but memorable ending. Again this as a journey is engaging and affecting – it is just how the film does it where the problems come in.The politicking feel to it is my first problem. OK it is not overly heavy (some of it could be explained away as creating tension or drama) but there is an air of condemnation for being in Iraq and a sense that perhaps we (Paul) were not fully prepared for the reality of it. Secondly there is a real heavy and unrealistic dig at Paul's employers as with his last bar of battery life (which seems to last longer than the other 80% of the battery) he is informed of his dismissal so the company can save money on insurance after his death; OK again it fills time and creates a feeling in the audience but it doesn't ring true and it seems heavily done. On a non-political side, the fire and the snake are a bit stretched but again they do create a bit of drama and fill time. The ending is harsh but effective as we have our hopes raised that the cavalry will literally save the day, only to have one last twist that will leave you feeling like you have been kicked in the stomach.Much to my surprise Reynolds does a great job. He holds the screen without having to rely on his good looks or body. Previously I have only really enjoyed him for his jock wit but here he had me convinced as he went through the cycle of fear, anger, pleading, acceptance and hope. It was a really great performance in a small indie film. Paterson's voice is well used, he sounds realistic and works well with Reynolds. Tobolowsky does sound like a man who sits behind a desk sees names as liabilities and cost rather than people.Overall Buried is a brave indie movie in concept but being "different" doesn't mean it is brilliant (I think some love it for what it is rather than what it does). The central idea is engaging and it is well enough executed to keep the viewer held even if some of the stuff that fills the time can be unconvincing or rather heavy-handed in terms of political comment.

I enjoyed watching Buried, even though I was disappointed and sad in not experiencing toward Buried a strong feeling of anxiety, fear, depression and breath running out of me. I didn't feel heart-pounded by this movie, nor did I think the movie was great and truly irresistible. The movie did make me a tiny bit anxious a few times during the watch though, and that's one thing, but not as much as I would have expected of course. One of the things I admired in Buried was its twists. I didn't expect most or any of these twists, but when I say I didn't expect them I actually mean to say that I completely didn't expect them. These twists are great and they will blow your mind. Believe me, you won't see them coming. When it comes to Ryan Reynolds, I think that his performance was unusually impressive and a performance worth remembering for at least a decade to come. I also like the fact that Ryan Reynolds's character is trying to get help in order to escape from the claustrophobic trap in which he is imprisoned, by calling on a phone he has with him, but as the movie continues on, Ryan Reynolds' character, instead, begins getting a call telling him of an inappropriate and illegal action from his own part inside his job, and that therefore, the people calling him and the people that have been trying to rescue him from the beginning, will not try to rescue him anymore and will leave him to his fate. I like it, because it adds more dramatic conflict --and originality-- to the plot. Other good things with this film include the fact that the movie starts right off the bat with Reynold's character having already been buried alive underground (someplace we don't know), rather than starting the film with what happened that led to his underground burial, because it makes the film more mysterious that way (and an efficient way to start a film as well), plus making Reynolds die at the end of the movie (through a surprising twist), rather than make him live in order to trick the audience's wish that he'll live, which is of course, artistic filmmaking. My rating for the movie is 7.0/10

Buried is easily one of the interesting movie experiments I have seen in recent times. Spanish director Rodrigo Cortes takes minimalist cinema-making to new heights by telling a story with just only one character trapped in one location in what is almost dogma 95esque settings, and far more importantly he manages to do so by keeping it interesting throughout the 90 minutes.Buried opens with a man trapped in what appears to be a wooden box buried underground. As the movie progresses we find out he is Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) an American truck driver employed by an American firm - Creston Roland and Thomas (CRT) in Iraq. His last memory is that of his convoy being ambushed by people (as Conroy puts it- terrorists, insurgents who the f**k cares?). As he tries to piece it all together he finds out that he has lost his special contact number ( that apparently every American in Iraq has been given in case of an emergency) but discovers a mobile phone ( in Arabic settings) and a Zippo lighter alongside a pencil, a pocket knife, and supply of anti-anxiety pills ( we later learn that Conroy suffers from anxiety)The rest of the movie is about his frenetic attempts to establish contact with outside world - his family, friends, employers, the state department to seek assistance to 'get him out'. But things start to get complicated when he is contacted on the phone by his abductor who requests him to arrange ransom from the American Embassy. Running out of both phone battery and air to breathe, Conroy soon finds out that the threats are not hollow; he is forced to make a video of himself which finds its way to the you tube. As things deliberate, Conroy starts to realise he is just a small, helpless insect caught in a web spun by devious and meaner players+++I missed Cortes' interview on BBC Radio 4 yesterday so I'm not really sure the actual intention behind the movie but there are enough, unmissable, Geo-political subtexts in the script - "I never thought I will find myself here". "I don't think any of us thought we would find ourselves here". I read the movie as Conroy being symbolic of America trapped in a situation which he couldn't get out of despite all the technology and the capitalism abound - multinationals ( admit it, doesn't Creston Roland and Thomas sound impressive? especially, if you say it where the outside temperature is 50 degree centigrade?), answering machines ( that great trickster of a machine that promises to callback but doesn't), robot call operators ( Sir, I can connect you to the FBI field office in Boston, New York, Chicago), the protocols (Crisis Steering Committee, Hostage Negotiation Team ) etc, all of which somewhat seem hopelessly trivial in the face of more existential needs.Buried is a intelligent 21st century cinematic marriage of Kafka and Beckett. Philosophically, it is a wonderful screen portrayal of a nervous breakdown in the wake of continuing threat. I found how Cortes had guided Conroy's character through a sequence of emotions - anger, pain, fear, disdain, dread, calm and finally acceptance very beautiful, though in a sense beautiful is not the correct word here. The camera work, especially the use of different angles to emphasise different emotions within the limited setting of the movie is commendable. Last but not the least, I always remembered Ryan Reynolds as that lanky guy wearing a maroon sweatshirt in Two guys , a girl and a pizza place. It is fair to say not anymore. To be frank, he is a bit of surprise here; he lives up to the demands of the role - a lesser effort would have easily made the Buried a 90 minute closeup photo-shoot in dark light settings. Ryan should be proud of his efforts in the Buried.In light of how the idea of cinema is recast lately, movies such as Buried ought to be encouraged, because, amongst million other reasons it defines what cinema is more than how a 3D movie would. I would prefer watching Buried again than writing a review of James Cameron's next big computer generated manipulation that is assured to collectively sweep the humanity into his bank account.

My rating: 3.5/5  Honestly this movie looks like it was made with a budget of $1000! And  most probably the director have used a wooden box with Ryan Reynolds in  it and few cameras in the whole 135 minutes. But despite all that,  seriously 'Buried' is not a bad movie at all. It's just purely new and  tense to look at and more enjoyable than many other high budgeted, cast  crowded flicks.   Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds-The Proposal, Just Friends) is a truck  driver who works in Iraq. After getting ambushed and attached by  insurgents he gets buried alive in a wooden coffin under the desert  sand. Its rather a box which is a little spacious than a usual coffin  which immediately comes to our minds but not spacious enough to be  comfortable. He discover a lighter, torch and a cellphone and some  other small stuff which makes sense when the plot start to reveal its  true colors. Later its exposed that rebels expects to demand a ransom  and so the story goes.   What purely fascinates me is that the movie never, I repeat never  leaves the wooden coffin. There are lot happens in the box and lot of  interaction with the outside world but all other people involved are  limited to voice acting. This gives an immense opportunity for the  viewer to be practically get stuck in the box with the main character  and just feel how he must be feeling. On top of that the fear mixed up  rage and frustration which builds up is wonderfully crafted throughout  the movie. I'm not gonna give out any spoilers about the ending or what  really happens in the box coz I really enjoyed the movie coz I never  knew much about it.  Ryan Reynolds does a wonderful job with his character. The roll is very  tough with limited moving space and lot of overflowing emotions. Very  good work done there for sure. And hats off to the sounds crew  including the dramatic score which play and huge part all the time.  More than any other movie the sounds really becomes so important in  this as visuals are not the key player for your imagination.   Overall 'Buried' is a very nice and scary experience. If you ask anyone  about their most deepest fears are, buried alive would be in the list.  Coz I know as it remain on a top position of my list.

I caught this gem at Sundance earlier in the year. It was part of the 'Park City at midnight' group of films, which showcased horror and thriller movies, and played them at, can you guess? Midnight. I saw Buried on the last night of the festival, Ryan Reynolds wasn't there, but both the director and writer were. It was a small theater on Main street, very artsy in it's look. But once the film started I had eyes only for the screen.It starts off with Ryan waking up, trapped in a box. A long box, the length of a human body, buried deep beneath the ground. From there the film plays out in an awe inspiring way, especially seeing as there's only so much you can reveal from one location. The way Rodrigo Cortes handled the filming is truly exceptional. From the start the camera switches between closely claustrophobic, and flying high above Ryan, showing the box with him inside and black all around. It's constantly on the move just like our main character's thoughts. Diving in when the action is intense, and then cutting to black when you don't think you can take any more.The pacing and plot of the film were nothing short of genius. And Chris Sparling, the writer, should be commended for his work. He said after the showing, that after having his scripts rejected for their cost of locations he decided to go for a cheep but genius idea. One location, one star, and a wealth of idea's. It makes a film like 'Salt' look like a giant waste of resources, when Buried does what even some of the best thrillers can't do, it brings us inside the character's head, and does it all without a romp through the city, or blowing things up.If you're one of those people who loves to sit on the edge of your seat, chewing at your fingernails, while you're constantly asking yourself what's going to happen next. Then by all means watch Buried, and consider yourself lucky that you're not in his shoes...

This is one of these films that works best when you have absolutely no knowledge about because it's going to be difficult keeping the ending a secret three years after the film was released . Unfortunately for me and a large proportion of people the bleak nihilistic ending became common knowledge via word of mouth very quickly . Does this mean it's not worth seeing if you know the ending ? Not necessarily because I enjoyed THE SIXTH SENSE despite knowing the ending to that movie before I saw it and BURIED isn't a film that relies one hundred per cent on its ending What the film is very good at is communicating the fear hope and despair of its protagonist Paul Conroy who after being captured by insurgents finds himself buried alive inside a coffin somewhere in Iraq . Commendably the producers have resisted the temptation that the action cuts between the protagonist and those trying to save him . But then you stop to realise this is probably down to budget . It's an independent production filmed in Barcelona so cutaways to offices in Washington and Baghdad and above surface in wartorn Iraq would have pushed up the budget , BURIED is a film that out of production necessity contains the narrative to one location of that of the interior of the coffin . That said it is a very effective claustrophobic drama that Hitchcock would have been proud of . Indeed the title gives gives a nod to the master of suspense , so much so you might expect the words " Directed By Alfred Hitchcock " to appear One aspect BURIED does touch upon is the politics of Iraq . There is some heavy handed commentary that becomes more and more pronounced as the story continues This seems to have alienated a few of the more respected commentators on this site and let's face it Paul's employers effectively stating " Oh you're buried alive ? Oh sorry we've got to cancel your contract then - goodbye Mr Conroy " doesn't ring true . Where the political subtext does work better is by having Dan Brenner the head of the Hostage Working Group played by a Briton . The Hostage Working Group was a 30 strong working group set up by the US State Department . It's unlikely a non American would be so prominent in this organization but yet the film makes the point that the invasion of Iraq was an Anglo/American alliance . The failure of Brenner to save Conroy can be seen as a failure of political will by the British to save the Southern sector of Iraq from violent Shia militias who imposed a reign of terror on the secular civilian population of that region , a situation only rectified by an American and Iraqi army led operation to eliminate the militias much to the humiliation of the British army In short this is a very effective low budget independent feature that'll stay in your memory and shows an audience and what can be done with a simple premise and a low budget . The politics of the film might be a bone of contention to some but let's face it - no one was apolitical when it came to the invasion of Iraq

I hate it when fantastic movies such as this get completely overlooked when it comes time for awards to be handed out. Buried is a triumph in minimalist filmmaking and is a heart wrenchingly intense movie experience. It is gripping, moving, frustrating, and terrifying. Oh yeah, and it all takes place inside a box. Paul Conroy, who is played by Ryan Reynolds and is the only character in the movie we actually see, wakes up in a coffin buried under the ground with no idea how he got there or who put him there. He shortly finds out that he is being held by ransom by a group of terrorists in Iraq. With only a pen, a flask, a cell phone, and only 90 minutes of oxygen, Paul has to act fast. The movie limits itself to an astounding extent, but makes the most out of what it has, creating an incredibly thrilling experience.How much can you really expect from a movie that takes place in a human sized box with only one person? Buried delivers a lot more than you would expect from this scenario. It has all the right elements to make it as enthralling as any action film we see today. To start off, Rodrigo Cortes does a great job directing his limited space. He miraculously pulls off a lot of great shots and brilliant claustrophobic nuances. He directs with enough skill to keep the movie interesting in its entirety. The movie never felt lagged or drawn out and every moment where it would have slowed down it would throw a great twist or shocking moment that drew you right back in.Furthermore, the director does a lot of great artistic work with what little he to work with. We have to take into consideration the fact that when you are buried underground in a coffin, there is obviously zero light. Thankfully Paul has various light sources with him in the coffin. And so to keep from breaking the realism of the film, these light sources are the only light in the film, making sure all light is authentic. Paul's light sources include a lighter, a flashlight, a cell phone, and a green glow stick. Each of these light sources gives off a different color, and these colors which obviously encompass everything when they are present add to and reflect the mood of the film. When things are calmer (relatively of course) we are treated to the soft blue light of the cell phone. As things grow more suspenseful and harrowing we are treated to scenes lit by the green glow stick. And when things grow more sinister the red lens of the flashlight is used. I found these minute details fascinating and they artistically added a lot to a film which had little room to work with.While Cortes' directing gives the film plenty of life, Ryan Reynold's stalwart performance really drives the emotion of the film. He delivers a top notch performance, and he as to seeing as he is the only character in the film other than the various people he talks to on the phone which we never actually see. It can't be easy to carry a film all by yourself, but this year we were treated to two performances that did a superb job at it, the other of course being James Franco in 127 Hours.Buried is a film that Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of. It is a groundbreaking thriller that does so much with so little. It is such a harrowing movie experience that you cannot forget. All 90 minutes of this film are fascinating and gripping, especially the last fifteen. The final moments of the film are some of the most captivating and enthralling moments I've ever experienced through film. During the finale of the film you will want nothing more than to know the fate of Paul Conroy, and when you finally do learn his fate at the close of the film your jaw will drop and you will be utterly blown away by such a captivating on screen experience.

BURIED, a Spanish-made production with US backing and an American lead, is the latest in a long line of shot-in-a-single-location movies; other recent entries include PHONE BOOTH, 127 HOURS (trapped in a canyon) and DEVIL (shot in a lift). This one takes a more extreme approach to the premise than the others, as the entire film is set inside a coffin where a guy has been buried alive.For the most part, this is watchable drama and it's rarely boring, as you might expect given the premise. The writer has carefully worked everything out, so that there's incident at regular intervals (Reynolds has to contend with plenty of dangers, including sand and snakes) and dialogue thanks to the handy mobile phone he's been buried with.I'm no fan of Reynolds as an actor, but he acquits himself quite well with the material and gives a believable performance as a guy driven to desperation and the edge of his mind. The most impressive talent belongs to director Rodrigo Cortes, who manages to keep everything interesting despite the limitations of his story - it's a bravura job, and the ending nails it perfectly.

If this doesn't remain in my top five come year-end I will be shocked. Who thought that a movie can not only sustain a full 90mins stuck within the confines of a coffin (and believe me, it doesn't leave the coffin) but that it would be one of the most cinematic and audacious pieces of cinema I've seen in a good few years? Like this year's Inception and Toy Story 3, movies like Buried are the reason I love cinema. It is escapism at it's best, ironic considering the setting. Who thought Ryan Reynolds, Van Wilder: Party Liaison himself could be so utterly mesmerising in such a challenging role? The movie is literally his. Sure, there are those he speaks to over the phone (he's buried with a Zippo and a Blackberry) but for the film's length, he is the only physical presence on screen. He goes through every emotion possible: fear, panic, anger, sadness, happiness, depression, acceptance, and all of it played so convincingly that you almost wonder whether they genuinely buried the actor and left a camera in there with him.There are minor gripes, all predominantly found in the first half. It feels somewhat episodic at times and there's a lack of any real tension during the first forty minutes but this is a pressure cooker of a film and the last half is unrelenting to the point of nausea, culminating in a truly great finale that caused me to shout-out in the quiet, near empty cinema.Buried is extraordinary. The only performance to beat Reynolds' in recent years is Sam Rockwell's stunning turn in Moon. High concept thrillers like this rise or fall on the delivery of their challenging set ups. Fortunately, Buried works.It really, really works.

Playing a tense and anxious characters comes so naturally form Ryan Reynolds. His performance was the perfect example of a thought-provoking and seemingly-clueless and innocent character in such a brutal and surreal situation. This was one of the films out there that proved you didn't need an explosive and grand production to create such a lowkey great thriller. The cinematography and production was the magnificent standout for me. To create such a tense setting was a complicated concept to formulate, and yet this film did just that. Added with an explosive twist at the end, this was on its way to becoming a classic.

Seriously this movie is just disappointing!!! A very, very stupid guy in a coffin trying to figure out how to survive but doing absolutely nothing worthwhile for 90 minutes... :( It takes a few minutes then you really dislike the guy! OK so its very sad for him he's buried alive in a coffin! I'll give him that! But after fumbling around with the Zippo lighter for what feels like YEARS - he should get the point! He's in a coffin - he needs the oxygen and YET HE KEEPS BURNING THE STUPID ZIPPO LIGHTER! Even after he finds a telephone with more light than the Zippo he still uses the LIGHTER who consumes all his oxygen.... ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? And everyone who's ever held a Zippo knows how hot it gets if you burn it a long time... Not only that but he spends most of his time talking to people who gives a damn... or doesn't believe him or he's horribly rude to people! And so many things are just done for the action and are so not believable... The snake for instance... if it can get IN the coffin and OUT again so can he! But no he has to use the brandy or whatever it is in the cantina to start a fire and burn all the oxygen! He has the knife from the bag that he doesn't find before the KIDNAPPER informs him its there although it has LOTS of thing in it! And whats up with that ridiculous call from his employers?!? Even people who doesn't know ANYTHING about lawsuits and insurance can hear that he should hang up that call after just the first few sentences but he just lies there and answers! Seriously after that I almost wish he just dies! Thats how obnoxious he is! Thats how illogical he is... He keeps doing so many stupid things in that coffin that you just can't believe it!!! And yes its not even original - People have been buried alive in movies so many times - and yes the CSI episode probably is fresh in memory but at least Nick Parker doesn't behave like an obnoxious little brat for 90 minutes so I'd rather watch that episode ten times than having to ever re watch this horrible, horrible movie!!!!

Buried (2010) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Effective thriller has Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) waking up in pure darkness and soon realizing that his convoy in Iraq was attacked by insurgents and now he is stuck inside a coffin without much time to live. He has a cell phone and a few other odds and ends and this here is really as much as you need to know in terms of story. BURIED is certainly unlike any other film that I can think of. Sure, there have been countless movies about being buried alive as the horror genre is full of such films but none of them actually put you in the coffin for 94-minutes and made you squirm like this thing does. It's interesting that the director and screenwriter decided to have every single second inside the coffin and I think this was a very wise choice. I think an uncomfortable filmmaker would have chickened out and not kept everything inside the coffin. There are several people that Paul calls throughout the movie trying to get help and I think a lot of people would have shown these other people but thankfully that doesn't happen here. I think the film works because as more and more time passes you begin to feel like Paul, as if you're trapped and by keeping you inside the coffin you never really get a chance to catch your breath. Every time Paul goes into shock so do you. Every time another issue comes up you can't help but feel his pain. Every single thing Paul feels in the movie is something the viewer is also feeling so it was very wise to keep everything in this small box. The amazing thing is that you'd think there wasn't too much you could do in such a small space but the screenplay offers up quite a few things that I won't ruin. I don't think anything came across as being faked or forced. The one problem I had with the film is that since we do spend the entire time in the box, it takes a few minutes to really warm up to Paul. Yes, we feel the dangers as soon as the film starts since it begins with him in danger but the suspense really starts after we become to know the guy, have feelings for him and wanting to see him get out of this situation. Reynolds is certainly one of the best actors working in movies today and it's a real shame that so many of his great performances aren't being seen by the masses. His performance here is another winner as he carries the entire film. Being trapped in a tight box without much room to move allows him to use facial gestures as well as other body movements. There's also a lot of work he has to do with his voice. The most impressive thing for me was just watching his eyes as we can see his fear, heartache and pain without him having to say a single word. The 2.35:1 framing allows some terrific shots but it also adds to the claustrophobic nature of the film. As more and more time passes you can't help but feel squeezed in just like the character and I must admit that there were a few times where I was holding my breath for so long that I ended up gasping for air. I won't ruin the final ten-minutes but they're certainly not for the weak hearted.
