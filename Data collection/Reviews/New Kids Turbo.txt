I had a big interest in this movie, because I have seen a lot of comedies from USA, Fance and Russia. I wondered how it is gonna be from Netherlands. Shortly... plot was with no surprises: they lost their jobs (some because of their fault, some, because of the crisis), refused to pay anymore just because they had no sense of responsibility . Actually in the middle of movie I had the feeling that script writer had no more other interesting ideas and that's why he played the old "movie in movie" joke. Actors were incredibly good. Soo stupid...omg!I really believed them. I think that, if characters of the movie are stupid, then why the script has to be the same, i. m. whit no sense of reality? So: script - undone, actors - great!

I must admit having missed the modern meaning of "New Kids" in The Netherlands. I thought it to be only a shorthand for the boys band from many years ago. How wrong I was! A paraphrasic sketch on the Deventer Humor Festival 2010 was needed to put me straight and to trigger some google-ing, just to make me feel having lived under a rock for 3 years. Apparently, this sort of language and behavior was allowed on TV screens at hours suitable for family viewing. How come this did not raise questions in parliament? Why did it not invoke censorship from TPTB (The Powers That Be)?Contradictory reviews are the best way to get me into a movie theater. Also, I was wondering how one could possibly fill nearly 90 minutes with (I thought) very thin material. But they succeeded splendidly, apart from the ending that was nearly as surreal as the ending of the first (1986) Flodder movie. Of course, it is easy to criticize this finale from my position as an innocent bystander. It could have been the only way to believably wrap-up the story line.Though a lot of political incorrectness passes by, plus an overload of strong language, I don't think any viewer of any age will be turned into a follower. The crux lies in the degree of over-acting, effectively working out as a satire rather than setting an example. In the 90-ties we had similar discussions about the "Foutje, bedankt" ad for Reaal Verzekeringen, which some people assumed to induce insurance fraud. But the acting by Rijk de Gooyer was clearly recognizable as overly over-the-top, demonstrating it was not the right thing to do.Speaking for myself, having lived at several locations in the province of Noord Brabant, the dialect sounded very natural. I could follow all dialogues without needing subtitles. I'm not sure, however, this will apply to other Dutch speaking people. There is sufficient testing material on several websites, just to become acquainted with the language and the behavior that seems to be the natural way of living in these circles. If you can't take it, do not go and stay home.A nice twist was showing a series of bloopers while running the final credits. It worked perfectly to keep the usual early leavers on their seats. Will this introduce a new trend?All in all, my final conclusion is that the movie is well made, casted perfectly, with the main actors performing very well. Their clothing and hair cut may not be the latest and greatest, but I assume that to be an integral part of the picture. The story has enough flesh to entertain us for 90 minutes. They surprised me positively with that, being an achievement in itself.Hindsight addition one year later: My review of sequel "New Kids Nitro" is less favorable, and then I express myself euphemistically.

The movie accurately depicts the live in an average Branbant village. It is fully correct, up to the clothing, the hair style, the cars and the language. Unfortunately, not everyone appreciates such honesty. Just a good laugh, don't make anything more out of it. PG21 for language, but since it's dutch, who cares? The repetition of the car-jokes becomes hilarious, after some time, as does the firing-mistakes. Very funny part when the farmer tells about the exchange he made during the war, trading Jews for German weapons. Please do not take this movie too seriously, and, people from Maaskantje, be happy about it

The kind of humor that's not for everyone, but these guys make it work. Never pretending to make a classic, but just wanting to entertain.It might look cheap, but is actually well directed, with decent production design and very nice pace.

Funny how people do react on this Dutch Movie, you love it or you hate it. First of all i was a fan of their sketches on Dutch TV, but this movie is much too long and goes on and on and on with no surprises. It's a lot of the same, a real disappointment The Dutch Press seems to have the same different opinion about this typical Dutch movie. They love it or they hate, in fact of the Dutch Papers NRC Next gave it 0 stars, which is uncommon, even for a bad movie . Making a sketch of 5 minutes is much easier that making a feature movie. And thats what the problem is with this movie. The second complain about the movie is that i expected another twist than what they normally bring, an extra. The fact that this didn't happen is not a big issue, but the fact that the film never has the same quality as the sketches is definitely a big disappointment.

This movie is so WTF that i asked a friend to pause it while i was catching my breath, because of laughing too much. Very stupid and very funny.

I usually do not like to watch movies dubbed - in this case (and with the sequel) I made an exception. I don't think the german translation took anything away from it - it actually may have added to the ... well let's call it "experience".The boys in question are as mad as they can be - and they do not care ... about laws, about respect, about decency, about politeness and anything else that you would describe as "good" and ethical. No they curse, they vandalize and they are as anarchic as anyone can be. All while they are being ... "funny". That is in the eye of the beholder of course - are you up for some juvenille madness? Then go no further and experience this intense and violent mayhem ... just don't expect this to have any morals ... this wants to offend you - or trigger you in any way it can.Not really my cup of tea, but I have to admit, it does exactly what it says on the cover and it always stays true to itself.

I didn't expect to go see a 'good' movie. I was familiar with the concept. I am actually living in Brabant, nearby the little town where this movie takes place. I do like a good, cheap joke. I was ready to rumble..Let me start off by saying that this movie is a waste of time. Even worse. This is not a 'good' bad movie. It's a 'bad' bad movie. A real story and plot are nowhere to be found. Nothing more than a lousy excuse to fill up an hour and a half with spitting, eating, yelling, fighting, shooting, etc. The rest of the movie is just terrible dialogue, one of the worst 'plot-jokes' I have ever seen, bad acting.. On top of that, this lousy concept turns out to be amazingly popular! Everyone in the theatre was screaming and yelling just like the idiots on screen. They turned the Cinema theatre into a battlefield. Some of them were yelling at a girl, calling her the worst names. It's the kind of audience that you don't want in your cinema theatre. Unfortunately, they'll have to live with it for quite some time..This movie is gonna be an enormous hit, without a doubt. Thanks to the empty minded mob. 'New Kids Turbo' reaches bodom depths. The lowest I have ever seen.

I must say, I didn't have high expectations when I saw the film and even the expectations I had, were shattered.I really enjoyed the sketches of the first two seasons (which at first weren't aired on TV, only on the internet (http://www.flabber.nl/)). These were really good. The sketches of the third season which were aired on Comedy Central in the Netherlands were not as good, but still made me chuckle from time to time. Then came the film New Kids Turbo. I did not expect a film made from characters out of sketches to be a success, and it really wasn't.Okay, the actors played their roles relatively OK, but the entire film sucked. I see the resemblance with the 90's culture in Noord-Brabant (I grew up near Maaskantje in the 90's) and that's about the only positive thing about New Kids Turbo.I didn't laugh once during the entire film, which is not a good thing, considering that it was supposed to be a comedy. Furthermore the storyline was really bad (there was no story). Halfway through the film I was thinking about turning it off, alas I did not. The entire film consists of cursing, shooting, and more cursing. Not really my idea of a fun time. Everything in this film is exaggerated, which is not actually a bad thing, but it is in this case when the entire youth of Holland is pretending to be a 'new kid'.All in all, my advice to you is: do not see this film! There are a lot of much better Dutch films! I really hope they decide to not make a sequel...

Set your timer. You need to laugh out loud at least five time in the first couple of minutes. If you do, you will enjoy this absurd, over the top hilarious movie. If you dont, it's not your thing.
I watch this movie every so often if I am in need of a laugh. I totally love the sense of humor. I love it!!
Gosh... I roll of the couch every time laughing my ass off....jonguh!
And the ending with the bloopers...Gosh have mercy on my soul. Tears streaming down my face!

"New Kids Turbo" is a 2010 Dutch comedy directed by Steffen Haars and Flip Van Der Kuil starring Huub Smit and Tim Haars. This is the film I chose to fill in for review #25 after realising I accidentally skipped the number in my counting. Many of you have given me some suggestions, but this Dutch classic was the only one I had in my shelf. Boy, what is this film actually? More than ten years ago this classic satire about five antisocial elements from the Netherlands has risen to become a huge success in Europe for it's sheer absurdity. Admittedly, the sketches and little skits from their original television series are some jokes I can always laugh about, but a whole feature length flick about it? I didn't know what to expect. Luckily, I didn't expect anything but garbage and wasn't quite disappointed with the outcome. That doesn't change the fact that it's straight out garbage. This film deals with the most stereotypes it has dealt with in the past and hence there's almost nothing new to it. The story is basically non existent and combines one absurd event with another. From political incorrectness to perverse action it has all of it.nWhat the original show has always benefited from are the extremely crazy but totally likeable characters who I really loved to follow throughout their shenanigans. Between some genuinely funny skits and jokes the film stretches the run time with nonsense and cuss words and really doesn't know how to entertain without those factors. But when it when it tries to be hilarious, it never missed and made me burst out in laughter countless times. I'm aware of it's extremely cheap nature, but that's exactly what I expected from it and definitely needed today. Don't ask me what the second half was supposed to be and what it really wanted to achieve with all the gory violence and shootouts, but I tolerated it somehow. That still doesn't change that the film in general isn't absolutely terrible in the first place. I guess I have developed some sort of a guilty pleasure in this case. All in all, this classic cult hit from the land of cheese and tulips works with the stereotypes that made it a classic in the first place and manges to deliver decent fun with it. Although it doesn't quite work out as feature length film and should stay on the level of a skit television show, it's a mindless guilty pleasure for in between that surprisingly is well filmed in the context for such a type of flick. It's without a doubt absolute garbage and definitely no masterpiece, but as it doesn't try to be anything else and simply wants to entertain especially the hardcore fans, it worked out for me. Between all the mullets and repeatedly used cuss words there's a lot of heart and I liked that. But for the last time: It doesn't change the fact that it's still absolute garbage, Junge!

First of all, I am an American. And I enjoyed this movie very much. This is not a comedy for simpletons.. Yet they will enjoy it as well. I think the acting was very good, (spot on!) and portrayed the characters just as they should have been. I loved how the characters dressed in outfits circa 1990's and followed failed trends of Americans. There are a lot of smart jokes if you're quick enough to catch on, if not - there are plenty, and I mean plenty of crude humored situations as well. I don't see how you can miss the entire story-line, but there is a story, and it comes together incredibly. Definitely different from the norm as far as stories and characters go.I found this movie to be very clever and entertaining. I could not stop laughing throughout..

In case you do not know, New Kids are a miniseries of short clips about an asocial group of Dutch hillbilly stereotypes living in Southern Netherlands. These miniseries contain quick low-brow humour that doesn't care whom it offends, will not stop before any subject and doesn't take itself serious. Quite refreshing and well done actually.Now, New Kids popularity brought it onto the big screen, where it pretends to be a movie, but is basically the same miniseries as were shown on TV, just tied together with incoherent story bits to form a length of a movie.It is like the young writers and producers came to the director and said "We want to do an explosion. We also want to do this and this because the Dutch will find it funny, and we want to do this because our friend here took a bet that we wouldn't have the guts to show this on TV, and also we always wanted to do this so.....yeah...go and pull it all together in a movie. Good luck". Subsiquently, the story unwinds itself half way through the movie, a sacrifice needed to fit in all the other stuff these "Kids" wanted to do on national television.It is still funny to see the "sjonnie" stereotypes - the actors do a good job here. Some of the jokes are pretty good, even if simple and some of the scenes show signs of intelligence. However, the movie is not as funny as it pretends to be. In fact, the outtakes shown during the credits may get more laughs than the actual movie.Overall, for a Dutch person the movie is worth seeing, even if just to be able to say that he/she did. For an objective entity looking at this film from the side, there will not be that much to praise. At least compared to the other generic stuff seen on TV, this will be something different.

The New Kids were known for their sketches on the Dutch television and were popular amongst the youth. Having myself friends in Den Bosch near Maaskantje I probably will get the humor better then the average watcher because I get their dialect and typical expressions. Nevertheless I thought the short sketches were better then the movie. New Kids Turbo is just an average movie to me with stupid but okay humor, but without a great story or acting. Nothing to be excited about. The eighties culture of the Johnny's and Marina's with their Camino scooters, training tracks and mullets might be fun to watch for people that knew that era but for people that don't they might find it a bit dull and stupid. I watched it once and won't watch it again.

I ended up finding a Scooter Song, the re-released version of "Friends", when it turned out to be a music video to this movie. Had to watch it. Fortunately I managed to view it using my German skills and the English subtitles. And I have to say: MAASKANTJE!I am absolutely amazed by the actors, the story-line seemed to be a bit flat at some cases, but it showed a nice story of friends of 5, losing their job, and fighting their way through that. Some scenes were quite funny, and since we also have similar movies, like Üvegtigris (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257290/) yet I always tell my friends about the movie, that it is a mix of "Beavis and Butthead" and our Glass Tiger (Üvegtigris). They quickly get the idea...I have never been in the Netherlands, but this movie made me to get around to Noord-Brabant, and visit the famous place, and all the other places the movie was filmed. Hard to believe, that the actors are just everyday guys, and their lifestyle doesn't even seem to be close to the one seen in the movie. This is what I call excellent work and acting! Fabulous work guys!...now where do I get my hands on some of those "Schulten-Bräu" beers?

And you call those people in this movie "actors?" I really don't think so. To me, these are the worst people who are really hurting the movie business, because if these people could make movie and to be called actors, then all the homeless guys, crazy people in the nut house, retarded people, mentally ill or mentally abnormal people could all become actors. You don't need any screenplay and director to provide these people with anything, all you need is a camera. I really don't understand how so many idiotic and witless farces could be put on the big screen and titled as "comedy" and all become box office phenomenons. Over one million Netherlands viewers who rushed into theaters and watched this movie? Germans who usually are cooler than any other mankind on this planet also gone crazy about it? What's going on? Not even one second during watching this movie that I have found funny enough to make me laugh but I never doubted that my sense of humor is strong. Then, why I didn't feel anything funny in this so-called "movie" ?

I had a big interest in this movie, because I have seen a lot of comedies from USA, Fance and Russia. I wondered how it is gonna be from Netherlands. Shortly... plot was with no surprises: they lost their jobs (some because of their fault, some, because of the crisis), refused to pay anymore just because they had no sense of responsibility . Actually in the middle of movie I had the feeling that script writer had no more other interesting ideas and that's why he played the old "movie in movie" joke. Actors were incredibly good. Soo stupid...omg!I really believed them. I think that, if characters of the movie are stupid, then why the script has to be the same, i. m. whit no sense of reality? So: script - undone, actors - great!

The economic crisis has hit the Netherlands hard, especially for the New Kids (Richard, Rikkert, Barrie, Robbie and Gerrie) from Masskantje. When they lose their unemployment benefits, they in turn refused to pay for anything. Their civil disobedience is captured by a local newsman; starting a local movement to not pay for anything. The authorities try to respond with escalating force but the boys respond with increased levels of idiocy.If you enjoy your comedy with manly moustaches, mullets, horking, swearing, white trash but want a European vibe set to Techno music, then New Kids Turbo is the film for you. The New Kids are from a TV show on Comedy Central Netherlands. The only comparable would be Showcase Cable show Trailer Park Boys from Canada. It's not surprising that it's also shown on Dutch Comedy Central channel as well.*excerpt from www.cinemaliberated.com

Better than all the nonsense comedies made in Hollywood(LeftW00D) 2020-21!It was the first time I saw a Dutch comedy with this style! It was great and spectacular...

I must admit having missed the modern meaning of "New Kids" in The Netherlands. I thought it to be only a shorthand for the boys band from many years ago. How wrong I was! A paraphrasic sketch on the Deventer Humor Festival 2010 was needed to put me straight and to trigger some google-ing, just to make me feel having lived under a rock for 3 years. Apparently, this sort of language and behavior was allowed on TV screens at hours suitable for family viewing. How come this did not raise questions in parliament? Why did it not invoke censorship from TPTB (The Powers That Be)?Contradictory reviews are the best way to get me into a movie theater. Also, I was wondering how one could possibly fill nearly 90 minutes with (I thought) very thin material. But they succeeded splendidly, apart from the ending that was nearly as surreal as the ending of the first (1986) Flodder movie. Of course, it is easy to criticize this finale from my position as an innocent bystander. It could have been the only way to believably wrap-up the story line.Though a lot of political incorrectness passes by, plus an overload of strong language, I don't think any viewer of any age will be turned into a follower. The crux lies in the degree of over-acting, effectively working out as a satire rather than setting an example. In the 90-ties we had similar discussions about the "Foutje, bedankt" ad for Reaal Verzekeringen, which some people assumed to induce insurance fraud. But the acting by Rijk de Gooyer was clearly recognizable as overly over-the-top, demonstrating it was not the right thing to do.Speaking for myself, having lived at several locations in the province of Noord Brabant, the dialect sounded very natural. I could follow all dialogues without needing subtitles. I'm not sure, however, this will apply to other Dutch speaking people. There is sufficient testing material on several websites, just to become acquainted with the language and the behavior that seems to be the natural way of living in these circles. If you can't take it, do not go and stay home.A nice twist was showing a series of bloopers while running the final credits. It worked perfectly to keep the usual early leavers on their seats. Will this introduce a new trend?All in all, my final conclusion is that the movie is well made, casted perfectly, with the main actors performing very well. Their clothing and hair cut may not be the latest and greatest, but I assume that to be an integral part of the picture. The story has enough flesh to entertain us for 90 minutes. They surprised me positively with that, being an achievement in itself.Hindsight addition one year later: My review of sequel "New Kids Nitro" is less favorable, and then I express myself euphemistically.

The movie accurately depicts the live in an average Branbant village. It is fully correct, up to the clothing, the hair style, the cars and the language. Unfortunately, not everyone appreciates such honesty. Just a good laugh, don't make anything more out of it. PG21 for language, but since it's dutch, who cares? The repetition of the car-jokes becomes hilarious, after some time, as does the firing-mistakes. Very funny part when the farmer tells about the exchange he made during the war, trading Jews for German weapons. Please do not take this movie too seriously, and, people from Maaskantje, be happy about it

OK, I've just enjoyed this movie even though I absolutely despise New Kids. No, I don't understand why I liked it. Somehow I got the humour this time. I was willing to let my inner 11-year-old take over. I laughed throughout the entire movie.I don't think there is any movie like this in the English-speaking world. It's hard to explain. Some of the other reviewers have explained it brilliantly, but I'll give it a try.The plot is that five young men, through their stupidity, lose their jobs and then their welfare handouts. Their leader decides that they're no longer going to pay for anything. Eventually the bill collectors and police show up, but they're no match for our disgusting moronic heroes. The government then decides to wipe the town out. But the new kids, despite trashing and abusing the town, love the place and defend it.This type of humour showcases shockingly unacceptable antisocial behaviour. This is why I usually hate it. There are many visual gags about sex, urination, defecation, vomiting and so on. We see the actor's penises. We see them urinate. Suicide, brutal car accidents, pregnant women ignoring their health, killing animals and babies, destroying property, disrespecting the police, women and gays, a constant stream of offensive insults -- all of this and much more is what this movie is about. They use the same very offensive language over and over again, until it loses all meaning. The five offensive young men utterly trash and terrorise a small, orderly town (a phenomenon that is sadly a little too close to what actually happens sometimes in the Netherlands). If a scooter fails on them, they attack it and kick it to pieces. There is no ideology behind their abuse, violence and aggression. It's just the way they are.The new kids are lower class Dutch men (the lowest), so in a way this is a very classist movie. The movie makes fun of them, but it also makes fun of the media, the police, the criminal justice system, the government and Dutch society. Everything really. The movie attacks the very concept of feeling good and watching a movie. It's as if the movie makers are inviting to wonder why you're watching this sh*t. The themes that come to mind are schadenfreude, nihilism and anarchy. In other countries, maybe the filmmaker might have used this comedy troupe to express witty insights. However, there is little of that here. There is some sophistication in this movie, but the sophistication is in its nihilism, its exploration of how low one can go, and its commentary on the stupidest aspects of modern Dutch society. There is some merit in the coarseness of the language and mockery. This movie has profound things to say about Dutch masculinity, but I'm not sure what.This movie is well made. It's funny and fast paced. It's very unashamedly Dutch.It's hard to explain why the moviegoer isn't consumed by hatred and disgust for these five a*sholes. They are indeed the heroes of the movie, but we're clearly laughing at them. They are so utterly stupid and mindless. At no point is there any doubt that these caricatures are losers and broken people unable to function in any normal way.This is a very difficult movie to rate. Many people would hate it. But I did laugh. I can see why others want to give it a 10.

The kind of humor that's not for everyone, but these guys make it work. Never pretending to make a classic, but just wanting to entertain.It might look cheap, but is actually well directed, with decent production design and very nice pace.

The lowest I have ever seen.

To understand a part of this movie you have to know a little history. I went to school in the 90's in Eindhoven, a city near the place were the movie takes place. In that time a lot of people dressed as the people in the movie, drove the Sita scooters and drive around in Opel brand cars pretending to be the tough guys. Those people were called Johnny and Anita's. Sneakers, sport clothing and the haircuts you see in the movie were all over the place. Those were great times as we laughed a lot at their stupidity and general behavior.So basically the writers/actors use that background and show us that kind of attitude and fashion is still alive in Maaskantje (the town were everything takes place). The actors behave like the Johnny's and Anita's back then, talking with an accent commonly used in that region. They are rebels, aggressive and lazy.The story itself is about all of them losing their jobs and when the bills get too much and they also lose their social security money, they decide no longer to pay their bills. Of course it gets them into trouble and their aggressive behavior gets them even more deeply into trouble, up to the point were the authorities have to step in...The movie looks good in all. Some stuff is funnier then other parts of the movie. Some cameo-appearances of (in)famous Dutch people. The actors are well know for their short video's from earlier New Kids and the Pulp Show and a lot of things will seem familiar looking at them and the movie.I had a great laugh, it's an entertaining movie but don't have great expectations watching it. Over 1 million people went to the cinema to see this movie and it's a big hit in Germany too. The German translation is hilarious since the real actors dubbed it, not stopped by their lack of speaking German! It is no wonder this movie scores big time in Germany after movies like 'Manta Manta' and 'Manta the movie'...ps don't watch this movie if you are a cop!

I would give it a 0 if it was possible. This movie is nothing but a very bad acted, scripted and extremely boring 90 minutes of pure amateurism, without so much as a good laugh.I think only those with very little intellectual capacity can appreciate the so called jokes and constant swearing and referrals to po and pee. I got a free ticket to see this movie but i noticed that the mood in the cinema was very subdued, just a few laughs instead of the great comedy i was hoping to see. A total failure for Dutch cinema.I had expected more from the New Kids, who in real life are not so mentally disabled as their movie wants us to believe.

I must say, I didn't have high expectations when I saw the film and even the expectations I had, were shattered.I really enjoyed the sketches of the first two seasons (which at first weren't aired on TV, only on the internet (http://www.flabber.nl/)). These were really good. The sketches of the third season which were aired on Comedy Central in the Netherlands were not as good, but still made me chuckle from time to time.

I did not expect a film made from characters out of sketches to be a success, and it really wasn't.Okay, the actors played their roles relatively OK, but the entire film sucked.

Furthermore the storyline was really bad (there was no story). Halfway through the film I was thinking about turning it off, alas I did not. The entire film consists of cursing, shooting, and more cursing. Not really my idea of a fun time. Everything in this film is exaggerated, which is not actually a bad thing, but it is in this case when the entire youth of Holland is pretending to be a 'new kid'.All in all, my advice to you is: do not see this film! There are a lot of much better Dutch films! I really hope they decide to not make a sequel...

Set your timer. You need to laugh out loud at least five time in the first couple of minutes. If you do, you will enjoy this absurd, over the top hilarious movie. If you dont, it's not your thing.

"New Kids Turbo" is a 2010 Dutch comedy directed by Steffen Haars and Flip Van Der Kuil starring Huub Smit and Tim Haars. This is the film I chose to fill in for review #25 after realising I accidentally skipped the number in my counting. Many of you have given me some suggestions, but this Dutch classic was the only one I had in my shelf. Boy, what is this film actually? More than ten years ago this classic satire about five antisocial elements from the Netherlands has risen to become a huge success in Europe for it's sheer absurdity. Admittedly, the sketches and little skits from their original television series are some jokes I can always laugh about, but a whole feature length flick about it? I didn't know what to expect. Luckily, I didn't expect anything but garbage and wasn't quite disappointed with the outcome. That doesn't change the fact that it's straight out garbage. This film deals with the most stereotypes it has dealt with in the past and hence there's almost nothing new to it. The story is basically non existent and combines one absurd event with another. From political incorrectness to perverse action it has all of it.nWhat the original show has always benefited from are the extremely crazy but totally likeable characters who I really loved to follow throughout their shenanigans. Between some genuinely funny skits and jokes the film stretches the run time with nonsense and cuss words and really doesn't know how to entertain without those factors. But when it when it tries to be hilarious, it never missed and made me burst out in laughter countless times. I'm aware of it's extremely cheap nature, but that's exactly what I expected from it and definitely needed today. Don't ask me what the second half was supposed to be and what it really wanted to achieve with all the gory violence and shootouts, but I tolerated it somehow. That still doesn't change that the film in general isn't absolutely terrible in the first place. I guess I have developed some sort of a guilty pleasure in this case. All in all, this classic cult hit from the land of cheese and tulips works with the stereotypes that made it a classic in the first place and manges to deliver decent fun with it. Although it doesn't quite work out as feature length film and should stay on the level of a skit television show, it's a mindless guilty pleasure for in between that surprisingly is well filmed in the context for such a type of flick. It's without a doubt absolute garbage and definitely no masterpiece, but as it doesn't try to be anything else and simply wants to entertain especially the hardcore fans, it worked out for me. Between all the mullets and repeatedly used cuss words there's a lot of heart and I liked that. But for the last time: It doesn't change the fact that it's still absolute garbage, Junge!

First of all, I am an American. And I enjoyed this movie very much. This is not a comedy for simpletons.. Yet they will enjoy it as well. I think the acting was very good, (spot on!) and portrayed the characters just as they should have been. I loved how the characters dressed in outfits circa 1990's and followed failed trends of Americans. There are a lot of smart jokes if you're quick enough to catch on, if not - there are plenty, and I mean plenty of crude humored situations as well. I don't see how you can miss the entire story-line, but there is a story, and it comes together incredibly. Definitely different from the norm as far as stories and characters go.I found this movie to be very clever and entertaining. I could not stop laughing throughout..

In case you do not know, New Kids are a miniseries of short clips about an asocial group of Dutch hillbilly stereotypes living in Southern Netherlands. These miniseries contain quick low-brow humour that doesn't care whom it offends, will not stop before any subject and doesn't take itself serious. Quite refreshing and well done actually.Now, New Kids popularity brought it onto the big screen, where it pretends to be a movie, but is basically the same miniseries as were shown on TV, just tied together with incoherent story bits to form a length of a movie.It is like the young writers and producers came to the director and said "We want to do an explosion. We also want to do this and this because the Dutch will find it funny, and we want to do this because our friend here took a bet that we wouldn't have the guts to show this on TV, and also we always wanted to do this so.....yeah...go and pull it all together in a movie. Good luck". Subsiquently, the story unwinds itself half way through the movie, a sacrifice needed to fit in all the other stuff these "Kids" wanted to do on national television.It is still funny to see the "sjonnie" stereotypes - the actors do a good job here. Some of the jokes are pretty good, even if simple and some of the scenes show signs of intelligence. However, the movie is not as funny as it pretends to be. In fact, the outtakes shown during the credits may get more laughs than the actual movie.Overall, for a Dutch person the movie is worth seeing, even if just to be able to say that he/she did. For an objective entity looking at this film from the side, there will not be that much to praise. At least compared to the other generic stuff seen on TV, this will be something different.

The New Kids were known for their sketches on the Dutch television and were popular amongst the youth. Having myself friends in Den Bosch near Maaskantje I probably will get the humor better then the average watcher because I get their dialect and typical expressions. Nevertheless I thought the short sketches were better then the movie. New Kids Turbo is just an average movie to me with stupid but okay humor, but without a great story or acting. Nothing to be excited about. The eighties culture of the Johnny's and Marina's with their Camino scooters, training tracks and mullets might be fun to watch for people that knew that era but for people that don't they might find it a bit dull and stupid. I watched it once and won't watch it again.

I get that this kind of humor isn't for everybody, but l think it's amazing

after the first half(i watched so much just because of the rating keep expecting for something nice to happen but till the end it was a waste of time :( ), i just pressed fast forward watching it in fast motion , is a waste of time for someone who appreciates intellectually made movies with a flavor of some kind of comedy, action etc. This i suppose wanted to be a comedy but because of the "to much stupidity" and boring action even the FEW moments where you can laugh a little are not so much of a laughter, for anyone with some IQ is a waist of time , i never write reviews in IMDb but for this movie with rating 7.0(13.04.2011) i wanted to say a word and to prevent someone else for wasting time with this because of his high rating (for now).don't want to watch a bad movie ? watch something else !

I ended up finding a Scooter Song, the re-released version of "Friends", when it turned out to be a music video to this movie. Had to watch it. Fortunately I managed to view it using my German skills and the English subtitles. And I have to say: MAASKANTJE!I am absolutely amazed by the actors, the story-line seemed to be a bit flat at some cases, but it showed a nice story of friends of 5, losing their job, and fighting their way through that. Some scenes were quite funny, and since we also have similar movies, like Üvegtigris (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257290/) yet I always tell my friends about the movie, that it is a mix of "Beavis and Butthead" and our Glass Tiger (Üvegtigris). They quickly get the idea...I have never been in the Netherlands, but this movie made me to get around to Noord-Brabant, and visit the famous place, and all the other places the movie was filmed. Hard to believe, that the actors are just everyday guys, and their lifestyle doesn't even seem to be close to the one seen in the movie. This is what I call excellent work and acting! Fabulous work guys!...now where do I get my hands on some of those "Schulten-Bräu" beers?

And you call those people in this movie "actors?" I really don't think so. To me, these are the worst people who are really hurting the movie business, because if these people could make movie and to be called actors, then all the homeless guys, crazy people in the nut house, retarded people, mentally ill or mentally abnormal people could all become actors. You don't need any screenplay and director to provide these people with anything, all you need is a camera. I really don't understand how so many idiotic and witless farces could be put on the big screen and titled as "comedy" and all become box office phenomenons. Over one million Netherlands viewers who rushed into theaters and watched this movie? Germans who usually are cooler than any other mankind on this planet also gone crazy about it? What's going on? Not even one second during watching this movie that I have found funny enough to make me laugh but I never doubted that my sense of humor is strong. Then, why I didn't feel anything funny in this so-called "movie" ?

"New Kids Turbo" is a parody about the Vokuhila scene that was very much alive all over Europe in the late 80s/early 90s and obviously the Dutch producers portrayed the local scene of Maaskantje around that era. I had a hard time understanding the slang and following the story that is told in retrospect by the cast in the last third of the movie. Then again the movie follows a chronological order. However the movie is total anarchy and is full of brutal jokes. I loved the sudden gags that were anything but politically correct. They are cursing all the time and they make fun of handicapped people. The only woman that is seen more often quite never is called anything but "who*re" The police is portrayed even more stupid than the gang which is rather funny. Even more fun is the fact that Tom Holkenborg did the score. I couldn't believe this movie has actually been released.

Just went to see it and I have to admit, the movie exceeded expectations tremendously. Having seen the sketches in before (and liking them a lot) I was really concerned that transforming this to a feature length movie would not work. I stand corrected.The story is quite thin, but that's not bad. The five main characters all loose their job on the same day and then decide not to pay for anything at all any more. With the rest of the country following their example the economy collapses. The government tries to put them in prison for it (but fails horribly) resulting in what the guys do best, putting up some sketch and making the whole audience laugh.There's one very bad point in the movie. (This is where the spoiler comes). It's the part where Reinout Oerlemans "walks in", declaring that the budget for the movie is spent and the cast just have to tell you the story. They really should not have done that.Apart from that, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Oh, and if you don't like the "New Kids" sketches on youtube, don't bother. You won't like the movie. If you're not familiar with those, find some especially the one with "the red one (die rooie)" and then decide. If you like them, go see it.
