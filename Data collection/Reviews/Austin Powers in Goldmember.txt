A great end to the trilogy, goldmember has the laughs and has some great moments. The storyline is bogus, but it doesn't matter, there are so many iconic scenes that it makes up for everything else.

After thoroughly enjoying the first two Austin Powers movies, they were daft but enormous fun, I watched this third instalment. I was disappointed admittedly, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The plot takes the whole meaning of daftness to a whole level, so some of it verges on ridiculous, and while Mike Myers is brilliant as Austin and Dr Evil, he overdoes it as the Dutch villain Goldmember and the cameos are very hit and miss. That said, the sets and costumes are still wonderful, the soundtrack is groovy and the script is comedy gold with the cool catchphrases, bad-taste buffoonery and surreal slapstick. In terms of supporting performances Beyonce Knowles is a knockout as sexy and sassy Foxxy Cleopatra and Michael Caine is a dentally-challenged delight as Austin's dad. Seth Green is also fun as Scott Evil. Overall, an inferior sequel, but it was still a lot of fun, with Myers still having his mojo. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Although it's definitely not the best Austin Powers film, Goldmember is still a good little film to watch when there's nothing else on. There's still a chuckle to be had with a wonderful cast with Mike Myers reprising his role (well, roles) as Austin Powers and Michael Cain as Austin's father was a good choice. Despite being more in the 70s than the last two even though Austin is clearly a 60's stereotype, it's a good film to pass the time with a couple of laughs.

`Austin Powers in Goldmember' provides us with an hour and a half of inspired silliness.  Not all of the film's elements work equally well, of course  a seemingly common occurrence in even the best of comedies  but this third in the series of popular spy spoofs generates more laughs than almost any other movie released in 2002.  Prime credit goes, of course, to Mike Myers, who both co-wrote the screenplay and inhabits no fewer than four of the movie's main characters. By this time, Myers has become so adept at his characterizations that watching him at work and at play here provides one of the prime pleasures of our viewing experience.  Also in attendance are the usual suspects:  Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, Michael York as Basil, Robert Wagner as Number 2, Seth Green as Scottie and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissinia.  Folks added to the brew this time around include Fred Savage, Michael Caine and Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra, a bad-ass soul sister brought back from 1975  Afro hairdo and all - to help Austin rescue his kidnapped father and prevent Dr. Evil from yet again trying to destroy the world (this time by using a giant meteorite to melt the polar ice caps and flood the earth).Co-written by Michael McCullers and directed by Jay Roach, the film has the good sense to throw caution to the wind and give Myers free rein to indulge himself in his own brand of inspired lunacy.  The film starts off with a deliriously clever and funny opening credit scene in which many of Hollywood's biggest names make surprise, good-natured cameo appearances. That sense of unbridled fun carries through pretty much the entire film, although there are, as to be expected, ideas, bits and jokes that seem less effective than others.  As with the two previous films, this `Austin Powers' suffers from the unfortunate tendency to both repeat and explain too many of its jokes.  Sometimes you do find yourself wishing that the writers would put a bit more faith in the audience to get the humor the first time around. Still, there seems to be much less of that in this particular episode, and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to more than compensate for the occasional  though not all that frequent  clunker or lull that manages to sneak its way in there from time to time. `Austin Powers in Goldmember' wallows a bit overmuch in the sordid moments, the gross-out gags, the locker room and bathroom humor that have become, alas, the hallmarks of the modern comedy.  In short, this is probably not the film to take the family to see if your family includes impressionable children and/or easily offended adults.  The sexual and scatological meters run into the red zone rather often in this film.  Nevertheless, `Austin Powers in Goldmember' works well if you enjoy a comedy where the actors seem for once to have been actually having a fun time while making it.   Their infectious joy spills off the screen in a way that it doesn't in movies like `Mr. Deeds,' `Men in Black II' or, perish the thought, `The Master of Disguise,' to name just a few of the comedic bombs that have been foisted upon the unsuspecting public this summer.  In contrast to the makers of those films, Mike Myers knows how to deliver the goods and, in the process, give his fans their hard-earned money's worth. Reserve us a seat for the next installment.

Okay so this film has been reviewed at the cinema already, so I'll save the story details. I won't even mention the great opening sequence or the truly hilarious turn by Sir Michael Caine. Although both are highlights of the film.Lets just get straight to the DVD. And what a great DVD it is. I wasn't the biggest fan of the film, but history has taught me that the Austin Powers DVD's are always a top buy.Take for instance the special features. The deleted scenes, as with the second Austin powers DVD, shine through and present a series of cut sequences and gags which are, quite frankly, funnier than 90% of the scenes in the films. It's odd but these collections of gags seem almost to work better by themselves and show how strong, when stripped down and without the need for a story, Myers creations are.On top of that, after the almost 15 mins of deleted scenes, is a very funny selection of outtakes, showcasing Myers talents at their best (Dr Evil/Austin Powers) and worse (Fat Bastard/Goldmember). Simply hilarious.The rest of the DVD  documentaries, scene break downs and music videos are good also and prove how much the medium of DVD can shine when time and effort are taken with it.If your not a fan there's little here that will convince you otherwise, but Austin Powers fans will rejoice in this DVD. It the words of the man himself "Yeah, Baby, Yeah!"

While this is still not as funny as the first one, it's still worth watching. It has a load of recycled jokes from both of the earlier films, and a little too many references to the first, in my opinion. It's not entirely bad though, after a slow start it kicks off and gets very funny, very quickly. Most of the old characters return, with a few new ones too. The plot is pretty much the same old deal from the first two, still spoofing old Bond movies. The acting is still pretty good. The characters are more colorful in this one, I think. More developed, perhaps. The sexual crude humor is still there, and is better here than in the second movie, I think. The first is still the best, but if you only see one of the sequels, I recommend you see this one. I thought the twist-in-the-end was pretty lame, but it didn't entirely ruin the movie, as it didn't seem totally out of character or totally unbelievable. I'd recommend this to anyone who liked either or both of the first two movies. The humor is mostly the same, and people who enjoyed the first two will most likely also enjoy this one. 7/10

Most of the cast of the first two Austin Powers films return for this third and latest Powers creation, Goldmember. I say latest and not last because I think with sufficient interest and the possibility of a good box office, Mike Myers could possibly be induced to revive Austin Powers and all the characters he created in the three films.Powers is back with his opposite number Dr. Evil and his henchman from the Spy Who Shagged Me, Fat Bastard and in this film he creates a new and even more sinister international villain in Dutch master criminal Goldmember. So named because he leaves the male members of his male prisoners painted gold, dead or alive. The members and the prisoners that is.Well if stealing Austin's mojo in The Spy Who Shagged Me didn't stop Powers, maybe kidnapping his father will. So Michael Caine enters the general mood of hilarity in Goldmember as Mike Myers father Nigel Powers who is kidnapped and taken back to the disco era of 1975.If you remember Powers was cryogenically frozen as Dr. Evil was in the first film and then sent back to the sixties. Now he gets a chance to experience the Seventies and things are wilder and crazier in the disco era than they were in swinging London of the Sixties. Myers gets some help from American agent Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra, but with his mojo going full blast and the fact that Dr. Evil doesn't want a rival in the evil business, Powers gets the job done.Seth Green gets to shine a bit more in this film as son Scott Evil who finally looks like he's coming into his own as a worthy successor to head the Evil Empire.Altogether Goldmember is a nice Shagadelic experience, really groovy baby.

Pros:
1. Mike Myers (Austin Powers/ Dr. Evil/ Fat Bastard/ Goldmember) and Michael Caine (Nigel Powers) deliver great comedic performances, and are utterly hilarious as a duo.2. There are plenty of Austin Powers wacky funny moments, for example, the running mole gag.3. The fun and iconic Austin Powers theme tune, which never fails to bring a smile to my face, even had its own dance sequence featuring surprise cameos by Steven Spielberg (Famous Director) and Britney Spears ('Boys' Music Video Performer).Cons:
1. Mike Myers, whether intentional or not, puts on a distractingly bad Dutch accent for Goldmember.2. The character of Fat Bastard is just as annoying and pointless as before. The whole gimmick is that he's really fat - that's it.3. As in the previous film, there are so many jokes that they end up diluting what should be contentious and serious moments.4. The special effects are really dated, as in the second film.5. The complete character 180s undertaken by Dr. Evil and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) don't feel earned or genuine. They decide to turn their backs on their criminality in one scene each after confronted with the truth, or with rejection.6. The constant celebrity cameos break the immersion as they're just distracting and nothing else. For example, the scene with the Osbourne family lamenting about the recycling of a joke from the previous film.

While the first two Austin Powers films in this comedic series concentrated on spoofing the late '60s/early '70s, James Bond movies and concentrated on female anatomy in the process, this one was centered on penises. I kid you not. (Hence, the title, a play-on-words from "Goldfinger.") I watched this film twice, within two weeks of each as I showed a friend the second time. The first time I thought it wasn't as funny overall as the other two Powers films and was a bit too raunchy, especially for the PG-13 rating which is ridiculous. After the second viewing, I changed my mind about the comedy (not the rating): it is just as funny if not more than the other two.A couple of the scenes were hilarious, although very crude in spots but some of the crudeness is what makes it funny. However, most of time I laughed more at the many subtle double entendres and all the double takes by Mike Myers, who plays at least four characters in here...all of them very well.It's goofy, stupid and nothing spectacular but definitely fast-moving and entertaining. If you've seen the other Austin Powers films, you know what this basically is going to be, humor-wise.Beyonce Knowles, who played the female lead, didn't have the beauty or body of Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley, stars of the other two films, but she isn't bad. There are numerous cameo appearances in here, starting right off the bat with Tom Cruise.Overall: sick (again) but funny (again.)

I would say that this film is rather strange, but then again it is Austin Powers so that sort of goes without saying. Well, I have now rewatched all three Austin Powers films, and I have to say they are actually pretty good. A part of me didn't like them back in the day, namely because of the heavy sexual innuendo that was present in the films, but these days I have lightened up a lot and I have come to really appreciate just how good these films are.Sure, they are a parody of James Bond, but the thing is that they are a really, really good parody of these classic films. In fact, while there have been a number of attempts to parody the most successful film franchise in history, no-one come anywhere close to the skill that Mike Myers has managed to put into his trilogy. Mind you, the fact that he plays multiple characters in the film goes to show just how great he is. Actually, I suspect half the reason he does this is because he probably couldn't get actors to pull off the characters the way that he wants to.The interesting thing he does with this film that he bookends it with a parody of the parody. It is a film called Austinpussy, and he has famous actors playing all of the characters that he plays in the franchise, and some more. Like Tom Cruise plays Austin Powers, and Gweneth Paltrow plays Dixie Normas. Yeah, I just love the names of the characters in the films, even if they aren't innuendos, such as Basil Exposition - the name relates to the fact that the M character in the films simply exists to provide exposition.While this film is rather old, and pretty everybody has probably seen this film, there are some lovely twists in this film anyway. Micheal Caine appears as Austin's father, and we have the main antogonist, who doesn't happen to be Dr Evil, Goldmember, whose name came about because his member was turned to gold in an industrial accident. The other cool thing about these films is how Dr Evil's submarine actually looks like Dr Evil. Oh, and also the fact that Dr Evil's plans are just so ridiculous, despite the fact that Number One tends to have much better ways of taking over the world, simply adds to how ludicrous the film is.Yeah, this franchise is actually pretty awesome, and this film is no exception, especially the scene at the end. Mind you, while there are suggestions about Scott Evil becoming more evil, it has more to do with him becoming ludicrous like his father, as opposed to being evil, but also rather rational. Like, the sharks with lasers on their heads. Yeah, I have to admit that I love this film, and thinking about it certainly does bring a smile to my face.

Really trying not to be negative here. Obviously, the magic of the first movie is long gone, and this third outing takes a hard swerve into the needlessly gross; but it's a step up from from the last one. That's good, right?One thing that really surprised me is how Verne Troyer gets to shine this time around, and how much funnier he is as a mini-Austin as opposed to mini-Evil. This part really worked for me.

If I can describe this movie in three words, I would say, "Shagadelic, baby, yeah!" Mike Myers, the comedic genius who made the phrases, "Yeah, baby" and the word "Shag" famous is back again in a movie that is superior to the Spy Who Shagged Me.While the original Austin Powers is better, this movie focuses on intellectual jokes. Many of the people I know who didn't like it, knowing them, it was probably because they didn't understand it. There were a few references to movies even outside the James Bond series. I even remember one instance where Dr. Evil was speaking as though he were Hannibal Lecter in an obvious Silence of the Lambs reference.Beyoncé Knowles has proven to be a worthy actress. I don't see what the problem is with singers doing some acting, because singing is a form of acting... But I digress. Beyoncé had a couple of punchlines, much like Hurley and Graham, but once again, Austin's babe is just there for Austin's (or in this case Mini-me's) sex jokes.Goldmember was one of Myers' most creative villains. As simple as lines like "I LIKE GOOOOOLD" and "I am from Sweden. Isn't that weird?" sound, the delivery makes Goldmember a one-of-a-kind villain, and I find him to be even better than Fat Bastard.Myers also cleverly planted some special appearances in that movie, and when he does, they do draw laughs.I will not compliment the end of this movie. While it was an unexpected plot twist, Goldmember could have done better without the scene they closed the movie with, especially since this is supposed to be the last movie of the series.If you watch one movie this year, watch Star Wars. If you watch two, watch the Godfather... but if you watch three, watch Braveheart... Ah, hell. We all see more than 3 movies a year. Just fit Goldmember in there somewhere!

To be brutal, this movie is cynical. I mean, Mike Myers is a funny guy, but this constant rehash of old material (see the radar jokes, the shadow-on-the-wall, the father-son misunderstandings) is just a bit worrying and suggests Mr. Myers has run out of ideas.There are some classic moments in the movie, like the beginning sequence, and the shadow-on-the-wall sequence involving Mini-me, but the whole thing stinks of self-indulgence and money-making rather than originality or passion.I felt myself, straining to laugh throughout the 90 minutes or so I was in the cinema, and I SO wanted to love this movie as I loved the previous two installments. Mike Myers is funny, and Beyonce Knowles is surprisingly good too, but Michael Caine isn't given the right material to shine and the Osbournes cameo verges on the pointless.Good, but not your best effort. Austin Powers 4? No thank you

Shag-happy superspy Austin Powers is back for the third installment of the spy-spoof franchise . Austin Powers (Mike Myers) travels back to the 70s to find his secret agent dad Nigel (Michael Caine) hook up with love interest . Upon learning that his father has been kidnapped, Austin Powers must travel to 1975 and defeat the aptly named villain Goldmember, who is working with Dr. Evil. Austin teams up with Foxxy Cleopatra (kitchy eye candy Beyoncé Knowles) in order to rescue the world and to foil his look-alike nemesis , Dr Evil . If he were any cooler, he'd still be frozen, baby!. Frozen in the 60's... thawing spring '97, baby!. Debonair. Defiant. Defrosted. On July 26th the Secret Will Be Exposed . He's still evil... He's still deadly... and he's still surrouded by frickin' idiots!. The grooviest movie of the summer has a secret, baby!. What do you call a swinger old enough to be your father? Daddy!. A New Breed of Evil.Hilarious and non-sense spoof of 60s spy and babe films . A festival of scatological humor, crushed velvet , political incorrectness , bad taste and silliness . Myers revels in playing the fool old-snaggle tooth, and he may step over the line every once in a while , but he gets plenty of mileage out of the one-joke premise . Myers wisely highlights the not-so-good Goldmember , along with other roles , instead of the periodically wearisome Powers . Myers again takes on numerous characters , this time adding a new villain Goldmember , a Disco-clad Dutchman with a gilded prosthetic and a penchant for world domination. Dr Evil is in good form but soft newcomer Goldmember comes up short and Myers is running out of fun ideas . MGM studios raised a stink about the title , too close to James Bond's Goldfinger , but finally saw the light and allowed the parody to continue. The motion picture was regularly directed by Jay Roach and in similar style than previous entries. Rating : 5/10 . Mediocre but it all still works because of Myers 's winking nice nature .The trilogy is as follows : Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) by Jay Roach with Mike Myers , Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York , Mimi Rogers, Robert Wagner , Seth Green, Fabiana Udenio. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) by Jay Roach with Heather Graham , Michael York , Robert Wagner, Rob Lowe , Seth Green, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, Elizabeth Hurley, Gia Carides. And Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) with Beyoncé Knowles, Seth Green, Michael York , Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, Michael Caine, Fred Savage .

The first Austin Powers film was so fresh, zany, charming, witty and  unique.  It took some time for many people to catch on (hence it's legendary  video rental record), but it was dazzlingly, mesmerizingly adorable.  The sequel came out and rather tarnished the prior film by either  dumping or revising various story elements and especially by taking a  turn towards the crude and vulgar. Still, it had it's share of  interesting moments and laughs. In this third installment, the goodwill  is almost completely gone. What remains is a hopelessly indulgent,  often foul and unfunny conglomeration of "jokes" and gags, many based  on bodily functions or other off-key subjects. That is not to say that  the film doesn't still deliver quite a few laughs. It's just that by  now, the whole enterprise seems very worn and familiar. There are  several truly funny sequences in the film, but mostly it is saved only  by some surprising and "right on" star cameos and the fresh appeal of  Knowles. The (typically) ludicrous plot kicks off with Powers having to  rescue his father (Caine) from the title character by travelling (too  briefly) to 1975. Then the whole parade of series characters is  involved in either starting or stopping the world's total destruction.  Myers is undeniably brilliant at creating various characters and giving  them each a voice of his own. He succeeds in creating these people who  seem real unto themselves. Unfortunately, he also is bent on catering  to what has to be a 13-year-old boy target audience with endless,  endless potty jokes and gross out gags. Some of them are very amusing.  Some of them are just gross. After a short while it becomes overkill.  Knowles (who is certainly no "actress") comes across as very attractive  and surprisingly charismatic on film. Her character is mostly  decorative, but she serves the purpose very, VERY well. Her  take-no-prisoners attitude is refreshing, even if she is continuously  shown being kicked in the face. By now, Myers is so much the whole show  that previous supporting cast members (Sterling, Green, Wagner, York)  can barely get a word in. Who knows how much of their stuff was cut in  the hour-plus of leftover material, but certainly plenty of Myers was  left in. It's hard to imagine the lengthier cut because this one seems  interminable, even with the bright spots. The opening sequence is  brilliant. The character named Dixie......hilarious full name. Other  creative and funny bits occur throughout, but the film can not escape  it's pall of crudeness and alienating self-indulgence.

When films series reach their third instalment, many bolts and nuts start to come lose . However this is not a case with Goldmember which shows us that Austin Powers still has his Mojo. The horny spy is back. He may of lost some of his freshness but there no doubt he still delivers. If anything gold member is possibly the best instalment in the series.Mike Myers is still great as Austin powers. Just like the last two, he does the usually stuff you come to expect that's including making you horny. Micheal Cane also makes an appearance as Austin's dad which to me, was brilliant. The gags are what you expect from Austin, as one or two gags are reused from previous films but despite this they are still hilarious . Basically, Goldmember is everything you expect. Dr evil, his evil henchman, Mini me, Fat bastard, scotty are all still major characters.Now when it came to beyonce being Foxy, Mr Powers sexy partner, i was on the fence. Beyonce to me, wasn't the best choice but then again, she just there so that Austin can still crack a rude joke now and then. The arrival of The Dutch was flat. seeing as he plays a big part in the film, he is easily forgettable compared to other characters. Even though the gags still make me laugh, they are easily associated with the gags from the previous two films as there only several of new, unique gags.Goldmember is another proud entry into the series which still shows that Austin is still groovy and has got plenty going for him. Despite reused gags, he can still make you laugh out loud which makes me come to the conclusion that Austin Powers is now one of movies biggest icons and after watching him for over four hours now on all three films, I don't care if i watch him for another four hours in new material because Austin always delivers and Goldmember proves this The same goes for Dr evil, i hope i'll still be here when he up to destroying the world for the hundredth time.

Weakest of the three in my opinion, but 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' still has some memorable moments.I enjoyed the star-studded and cameo-filled opening scene, it's well done. Mike Myers is again great in his roles, especially Dr. Evil, and Beyoncé Knowles is a positive addition. The stuff with Dr. Evil isn't as good as in the 1999 film, yet he still made me laugh a few times; he does have one of the series' best moments with the rendition of the Jay-Z song.However, I did feel a few pacing issues. All in all, it's still worth a watch. As noted, the cameos are solid - and let's just say they chose the perfect actor to play Dr. Evil...

Here we are into the third installment of "Austin Powers" and sadly it is wearing thin. We don't have the same originality that the first one brought or the usually funny jokes. Now while the ideas were good and it seemed strong, it just didn't give.The beginning is classic and it seemed like this was going to be great. I mean, we have Tom Cruise playing Austin Powers, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, John Travolta as Goldmember, and Danny Devito as Mini Me in the Austin Powers movie! Just great and brilliant. But then the actual movie starts, Felicity is not here for no explained reason and Austin is single. Leading him to Foxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyonce and is way too stereotypical. Fat Bastard is also back and tries too hard with his disgusting jokes that fall flat.Dr. Evil is still pretty funny, but again just loosing his touch. We have a brilliant idea of Michael Caine as Austin's dad, but it's a hit and miss with Caine's dull performance. Goldmember, also played by Myers, is just too disgusting and tries too hard to impress the audience as another funny villain. Scott has now decided to take over the family business, which takes his cool and unique style away. :( Mini Me is push aside then from Dr. Evil and he joins up with Austin to try again for that "shocking and ironic" laugh of him now being a Mini Austin. The ending is just ridicules.I'm sorry, this just didn't amuse me that much. The jokes were overused and not funny any more. There are too many stereotypical performances in here and the only thing worth watching is the beginning with the amazing cameo's. That was unforgettable, but the rest is just a skip. So, pass on this one, guys, it's not worth your time really.6/10-and 4 points of that goes to the beginning!

I've said this before, and I'll type it again: only see this Austin Powers sequel once.While Austin Powers in Goldmember has its moments, such as the terrific opening credit scene (the best so far,) they are so few and far between making some of this movie's unbearable.I didn't heed to my own warning, and this is the second time I've seen it. But, then, I don't like to write reviews on movies I haven't seen in awhile. This one being almost 7½ years.This time out, I got tricked. After being somewhat disappointed in Austin Powers: The Spy That Shagged Me – comparatively speaking to the brilliant Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, I was pumped up after the now-established opening dance scene. And I thought this would bring the series back on track. Unfortunately, it only goes straight downhill after that.Austin captures Dr. Evil immediately in this chapter, but learns through a Hannibal Lecter/Magneto meeting that another Mike Myers's creation, Goldmember, is on the loose to cause havoc. Austin must race, literally, back in time, this time in the 1970's, to thwart Goldmember's plans. Back to the year 2002 he goes and everyone's where they're supposed to be situated to make an Austin Powers movie.A few things have changed: Austin's dad (Caine) plays an important role, Scott becomes more evil while the always-scene-stealer Mini-Me loses some and more history of Austin and Dr. Evil's past is revealed.Sure, the movie has its moments. Some parts I did laugh out loud. But for the most part, it was definitely getting stale, the jokes recycled and the newest, uh, member, Goldmember ,was unbearable to watch. Yeah, I know a lot of humor is gross-out jokes, but when he eats his skin (sorry, I never caught that spoof/reference) it's beyond nasty.Again, it's worth maybe one viewing, but I have to almost say skip this one and pray, if they make a part IV, they'll attempt to reboot the series back to its hilarious roots. At least come up with some new jokes.

Fabulous film, and thoroughly made the world we live in seem a happier place 😀 I think people need more of this kind of comedy to shine a light through our current political and interpersonal meltdown...Austin Powers in Goldmember makes you laugh like before you mistrusted people, and smile like before you first looked behind the curtain.Class act... please make more 😄

When I first saw the reviews of this movie, the trailers and the previews in the theater, I thought, "Oh wow, has Austin Powers lost its edge." But I was misled by the "teaser" trailers. I did not, as a result, see this movie in the theater, but instead waited for it to come out on video.My loss.This is by FAR, the best Austin Powers movie yet. This is supposed to be the last installment, the concluding chapter of the trilogy, as it were, but I hope that is not the case.Beonce was wonderful as Foxy. She's no Heather Graham, but that could be a good thing.This movie is wonderfully entertaining, with the original cast members of the first two (a rarity), and some nice surprises.It gets a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.

If you howled (as I did) at THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, stick in the DVD and watch it again. The experience will be far better than seeing this "new" film made up of old gags. The theory seems to be that if several poopoo, teetee and fart jokes were funny, then ten times more of them will be ten times funnier. Uh-uh: it works in inverse proportion. The sole laugh-out-loud I had from this film was a piece of stock footage of a chimp falling out of a tree. The jokes telegraph themselves from miles away, the dialogue is horrible, and the plot...wait, what plot? On paper it would seem like a brainstorming session that no one bothered to write a first draft of. The shadow bit from SHAGGED ME is repeated, as is the bit with Dr. Evil's space ship/satellite/whatever being misidentified as giant body parts, and lots of other bits are rehashed as well. How in God's name is this getting the reviews it's been getting? Has our sense of humor sunk to such a dreadfully low level that we chortle at lists of euphemisms for male genitalia? To their credit, the audience I was with didn't laugh much either. Maybe you can't fool all of the people all of the time. I'd love to see word of mouth kill this puppy in the coming weeks. Ooo. Bad. So very very bad.

Mike Myers returns for the third installment of his "Austin Powers" franchise.  In "Goldmember," he comes full circle with the histories of Austin and Dr. Evil.  Myers again plays shagadelic secret agent Austin Powers, his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil and horrible henchman Fat Bastard, and now also a new bad guy, the Dutch hedonist Goldmember.  I found this movie hilarious and outrageous!  It had a lot of crude humor, like Austin hiding behind Mr. Roboto's fountain.  But there was also a good amount of self-parody.  The best scenes included Dr. Evil's prison rap video, and the suggestive subtitles in Mr. Roboto's office.  The several cameos were also enjoyable, especially Ozzy Osbourne pointing out the joke carried over from "The Spy Who Shagged Me."  The scene with Godzilla and its copyright was a relevant joke, considering the MPAA's temporary ban on the use of the title "Goldmember."  I did have a complaint about the continuity.  The difference in Austin Powers' trademark "choppers" was noticeable.  And although I'd have liked an explanation for the absence of Felicity Shagwell, I'm glad she was not revealed in the movie as a fembot!  Anyway, with this third installment, Austin Powers goes out with a bang!

The first two Austin Powers movies were brilliant, but "Goldmember" is where the cracks are beginning to show.  The first half is really funny ("Master Evil" "Fook Mi" etc.) but the characters get old pretty fast, and Goldmember, the Dutch villain, just isn't funny.  Part of the problem is that we're too familiar with Austin, Dr. Evil, Mini Me, etc., and part of it is the 1960's spy formula is wearing thin.  I hope this is the last one, the first two are great and worth seeing, but see this one only if you must see the third installment.  6 out of 10.

The movie started not how I expected with Tom Cruise playing as Austin Powers in a fictional movie based on him which I think would've been better than the actual movie. As you would expect from Austin Powers movies the plot is crazy, but the plot was so much crazier that it didn't really matter if you followed it or not. Whether you like this movie or not is based on how many jokes there are and how funny the movie is and although there were a few funny moments, it was not as funny as the first movie. Can someone explain why Beyonce was in the movie because I felt like her role felt pointless and she didn't portray her character as well as Austin's love interests in the previous 2 movies.

A great end to the trilogy, goldmember has the laughs and has some great moments. The storyline is bogus, but it doesn't matter, there are so many iconic scenes that it makes up for everything else.

After thoroughly enjoying the first two Austin Powers movies, they were daft but enormous fun, I watched this third instalment. I was disappointed admittedly, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The plot takes the whole meaning of daftness to a whole level, so some of it verges on ridiculous, and while Mike Myers is brilliant as Austin and Dr Evil, he overdoes it as the Dutch villain Goldmember and the cameos are very hit and miss. That said, the sets and costumes are still wonderful, the soundtrack is groovy and the script is comedy gold with the cool catchphrases, bad-taste buffoonery and surreal slapstick. In terms of supporting performances Beyonce Knowles is a knockout as sexy and sassy Foxxy Cleopatra and Michael Caine is a dentally-challenged delight as Austin's dad. Seth Green is also fun as Scott Evil. Overall, an inferior sequel, but it was still a lot of fun, with Myers still having his mojo. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Although it's definitely not the best Austin Powers film, Goldmember is still a good little film to watch when there's nothing else on. There's still a chuckle to be had with a wonderful cast with Mike Myers reprising his role (well, roles) as Austin Powers and Michael Cain as Austin's father was a good choice. Despite being more in the 70s than the last two even though Austin is clearly a 60's stereotype, it's a good film to pass the time with a couple of laughs.

`Austin Powers in Goldmember' provides us with an hour and a half of inspired silliness.  Not all of the film's elements work equally well, of course  a seemingly common occurrence in even the best of comedies  but this third in the series of popular spy spoofs generates more laughs than almost any other movie released in 2002.  Prime credit goes, of course, to Mike Myers, who both co-wrote the screenplay and inhabits no fewer than four of the movie's main characters. By this time, Myers has become so adept at his characterizations that watching him at work and at play here provides one of the prime pleasures of our viewing experience.  Also in attendance are the usual suspects:  Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, Michael York as Basil, Robert Wagner as Number 2, Seth Green as Scottie and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissinia.  Folks added to the brew this time around include Fred Savage, Michael Caine and Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra, a bad-ass soul sister brought back from 1975  Afro hairdo and all - to help Austin rescue his kidnapped father and prevent Dr. Evil from yet again trying to destroy the world (this time by using a giant meteorite to melt the polar ice caps and flood the earth).Co-written by Michael McCullers and directed by Jay Roach, the film has the good sense to throw caution to the wind and give Myers free rein to indulge himself in his own brand of inspired lunacy.  The film starts off with a deliriously clever and funny opening credit scene in which many of Hollywood's biggest names make surprise, good-natured cameo appearances. That sense of unbridled fun carries through pretty much the entire film, although there are, as to be expected, ideas, bits and jokes that seem less effective than others.  As with the two previous films, this `Austin Powers' suffers from the unfortunate tendency to both repeat and explain too many of its jokes.  Sometimes you do find yourself wishing that the writers would put a bit more faith in the audience to get the humor the first time around. Still, there seems to be much less of that in this particular episode, and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to more than compensate for the occasional  though not all that frequent  clunker or lull that manages to sneak its way in there from time to time. `Austin Powers in Goldmember' wallows a bit overmuch in the sordid moments, the gross-out gags, the locker room and bathroom humor that have become, alas, the hallmarks of the modern comedy.  In short, this is probably not the film to take the family to see if your family includes impressionable children and/or easily offended adults.  The sexual and scatological meters run into the red zone rather often in this film.  Nevertheless, `Austin Powers in Goldmember' works well if you enjoy a comedy where the actors seem for once to have been actually having a fun time while making it.   Their infectious joy spills off the screen in a way that it doesn't in movies like `Mr. Deeds,' `Men in Black II' or, perish the thought, `The Master of Disguise,' to name just a few of the comedic bombs that have been foisted upon the unsuspecting public this summer.  In contrast to the makers of those films, Mike Myers knows how to deliver the goods and, in the process, give his fans their hard-earned money's worth. Reserve us a seat for the next installment.

Okay so this film has been reviewed at the cinema already, so I'll save the story details. I won't even mention the great opening sequence or the truly hilarious turn by Sir Michael Caine. Although both are highlights of the film.Lets just get straight to the DVD. And what a great DVD it is. I wasn't the biggest fan of the film, but history has taught me that the Austin Powers DVD's are always a top buy.Take for instance the special features. The deleted scenes, as with the second Austin powers DVD, shine through and present a series of cut sequences and gags which are, quite frankly, funnier than 90% of the scenes in the films. It's odd but these collections of gags seem almost to work better by themselves and show how strong, when stripped down and without the need for a story, Myers creations are.On top of that, after the almost 15 mins of deleted scenes, is a very funny selection of outtakes, showcasing Myers talents at their best (Dr Evil/Austin Powers) and worse (Fat Bastard/Goldmember). Simply hilarious.The rest of the DVD  documentaries, scene break downs and music videos are good also and prove how much the medium of DVD can shine when time and effort are taken with it.If your not a fan there's little here that will convince you otherwise, but Austin Powers fans will rejoice in this DVD. It the words of the man himself "Yeah, Baby, Yeah!"

While this is still not as funny as the first one, it's still worth watching. It has a load of recycled jokes from both of the earlier films, and a little too many references to the first, in my opinion. It's not entirely bad though, after a slow start it kicks off and gets very funny, very quickly. Most of the old characters return, with a few new ones too. The plot is pretty much the same old deal from the first two, still spoofing old Bond movies. The acting is still pretty good. The characters are more colorful in this one, I think. More developed, perhaps. The sexual crude humor is still there, and is better here than in the second movie, I think. The first is still the best, but if you only see one of the sequels, I recommend you see this one. I thought the twist-in-the-end was pretty lame, but it didn't entirely ruin the movie, as it didn't seem totally out of character or totally unbelievable. I'd recommend this to anyone who liked either or both of the first two movies. The humor is mostly the same, and people who enjoyed the first two will most likely also enjoy this one. 7/10

Most of the cast of the first two Austin Powers films return for this third and latest Powers creation, Goldmember. I say latest and not last because I think with sufficient interest and the possibility of a good box office, Mike Myers could possibly be induced to revive Austin Powers and all the characters he created in the three films.Powers is back with his opposite number Dr. Evil and his henchman from the Spy Who Shagged Me, Fat Bastard and in this film he creates a new and even more sinister international villain in Dutch master criminal Goldmember. So named because he leaves the male members of his male prisoners painted gold, dead or alive. The members and the prisoners that is.Well if stealing Austin's mojo in The Spy Who Shagged Me didn't stop Powers, maybe kidnapping his father will. So Michael Caine enters the general mood of hilarity in Goldmember as Mike Myers father Nigel Powers who is kidnapped and taken back to the disco era of 1975.If you remember Powers was cryogenically frozen as Dr. Evil was in the first film and then sent back to the sixties. Now he gets a chance to experience the Seventies and things are wilder and crazier in the disco era than they were in swinging London of the Sixties. Myers gets some help from American agent Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra, but with his mojo going full blast and the fact that Dr. Evil doesn't want a rival in the evil business, Powers gets the job done.Seth Green gets to shine a bit more in this film as son Scott Evil who finally looks like he's coming into his own as a worthy successor to head the Evil Empire.Altogether Goldmember is a nice Shagadelic experience, really groovy baby.

Really trying not to be negative here. Obviously, the magic of the first movie is long gone, and this third outing takes a hard swerve into the needlessly gross; but it's a step up from from the last one. That's good, right?One thing that really surprised me is how Verne Troyer gets to shine this time around, and how much funnier he is as a mini-Austin as opposed to mini-Evil. This part really worked for me.

While the first two Austin Powers films in this comedic series concentrated on spoofing the late '60s/early '70s, James Bond movies and concentrated on female anatomy in the process, this one was centered on penises. I kid you not. (Hence, the title, a play-on-words from "Goldfinger.") I watched this film twice, within two weeks of each as I showed a friend the second time. The first time I thought it wasn't as funny overall as the other two Powers films and was a bit too raunchy, especially for the PG-13 rating which is ridiculous. After the second viewing, I changed my mind about the comedy (not the rating): it is just as funny if not more than the other two.A couple of the scenes were hilarious, although very crude in spots but some of the crudeness is what makes it funny. However, most of time I laughed more at the many subtle double entendres and all the double takes by Mike Myers, who plays at least four characters in here...all of them very well.It's goofy, stupid and nothing spectacular but definitely fast-moving and entertaining. If you've seen the other Austin Powers films, you know what this basically is going to be, humor-wise.Beyonce Knowles, who played the female lead, didn't have the beauty or body of Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley, stars of the other two films, but she isn't bad. There are numerous cameo appearances in here, starting right off the bat with Tom Cruise.Overall: sick (again) but funny (again.)

I would say that this film is rather strange, but then again it is Austin Powers so that sort of goes without saying. Well, I have now rewatched all three Austin Powers films, and I have to say they are actually pretty good. A part of me didn't like them back in the day, namely because of the heavy sexual innuendo that was present in the films, but these days I have lightened up a lot and I have come to really appreciate just how good these films are.Sure, they are a parody of James Bond, but the thing is that they are a really, really good parody of these classic films. In fact, while there have been a number of attempts to parody the most successful film franchise in history, no-one come anywhere close to the skill that Mike Myers has managed to put into his trilogy. Mind you, the fact that he plays multiple characters in the film goes to show just how great he is. Actually, I suspect half the reason he does this is because he probably couldn't get actors to pull off the characters the way that he wants to.The interesting thing he does with this film that he bookends it with a parody of the parody. It is a film called Austinpussy, and he has famous actors playing all of the characters that he plays in the franchise, and some more. Like Tom Cruise plays Austin Powers, and Gweneth Paltrow plays Dixie Normas. Yeah, I just love the names of the characters in the films, even if they aren't innuendos, such as Basil Exposition - the name relates to the fact that the M character in the films simply exists to provide exposition.While this film is rather old, and pretty everybody has probably seen this film, there are some lovely twists in this film anyway. Micheal Caine appears as Austin's father, and we have the main antogonist, who doesn't happen to be Dr Evil, Goldmember, whose name came about because his member was turned to gold in an industrial accident. The other cool thing about these films is how Dr Evil's submarine actually looks like Dr Evil. Oh, and also the fact that Dr Evil's plans are just so ridiculous, despite the fact that Number One tends to have much better ways of taking over the world, simply adds to how ludicrous the film is.Yeah, this franchise is actually pretty awesome, and this film is no exception, especially the scene at the end. Mind you, while there are suggestions about Scott Evil becoming more evil, it has more to do with him becoming ludicrous like his father, as opposed to being evil, but also rather rational. Like, the sharks with lasers on their heads. Yeah, I have to admit that I love this film, and thinking about it certainly does bring a smile to my face.

Pros:
1. Mike Myers (Austin Powers/ Dr. Evil/ Fat Bastard/ Goldmember) and Michael Caine (Nigel Powers) deliver great comedic performances, and are utterly hilarious as a duo.2. There are plenty of Austin Powers wacky funny moments, for example, the running mole gag.3. The fun and iconic Austin Powers theme tune, which never fails to bring a smile to my face, even had its own dance sequence featuring surprise cameos by Steven Spielberg (Famous Director) and Britney Spears ('Boys' Music Video Performer).Cons:
1. Mike Myers, whether intentional or not, puts on a distractingly bad Dutch accent for Goldmember.2. The character of Fat Bastard is just as annoying and pointless as before. The whole gimmick is that he's really fat - that's it.3. As in the previous film, there are so many jokes that they end up diluting what should be contentious and serious moments.4. The special effects are really dated, as in the second film.5. The complete character 180s undertaken by Dr. Evil and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) don't feel earned or genuine. They decide to turn their backs on their criminality in one scene each after confronted with the truth, or with rejection.6. The constant celebrity cameos break the immersion as they're just distracting and nothing else. For example, the scene with the Osbourne family lamenting about the recycling of a joke from the previous film.

If I can describe this movie in three words, I would say, "Shagadelic, baby, yeah!" Mike Myers, the comedic genius who made the phrases, "Yeah, baby" and the word "Shag" famous is back again in a movie that is superior to the Spy Who Shagged Me.While the original Austin Powers is better, this movie focuses on intellectual jokes. Many of the people I know who didn't like it, knowing them, it was probably because they didn't understand it. There were a few references to movies even outside the James Bond series. I even remember one instance where Dr. Evil was speaking as though he were Hannibal Lecter in an obvious Silence of the Lambs reference.Beyoncé Knowles has proven to be a worthy actress. I don't see what the problem is with singers doing some acting, because singing is a form of acting... But I digress. Beyoncé had a couple of punchlines, much like Hurley and Graham, but once again, Austin's babe is just there for Austin's (or in this case Mini-me's) sex jokes.Goldmember was one of Myers' most creative villains. As simple as lines like "I LIKE GOOOOOLD" and "I am from Sweden. Isn't that weird?" sound, the delivery makes Goldmember a one-of-a-kind villain, and I find him to be even better than Fat Bastard.Myers also cleverly planted some special appearances in that movie, and when he does, they do draw laughs.I will not compliment the end of this movie. While it was an unexpected plot twist, Goldmember could have done better without the scene they closed the movie with, especially since this is supposed to be the last movie of the series.If you watch one movie this year, watch Star Wars. If you watch two, watch the Godfather... but if you watch three, watch Braveheart... Ah, hell. We all see more than 3 movies a year. Just fit Goldmember in there somewhere!

To be brutal, this movie is cynical. I mean, Mike Myers is a funny guy, but this constant rehash of old material (see the radar jokes, the shadow-on-the-wall, the father-son misunderstandings) is just a bit worrying and suggests Mr. Myers has run out of ideas.There are some classic moments in the movie, like the beginning sequence, and the shadow-on-the-wall sequence involving Mini-me, but the whole thing stinks of self-indulgence and money-making rather than originality or passion.I felt myself, straining to laugh throughout the 90 minutes or so I was in the cinema, and I SO wanted to love this movie as I loved the previous two installments. Mike Myers is funny, and Beyonce Knowles is surprisingly good too, but Michael Caine isn't given the right material to shine and the Osbournes cameo verges on the pointless.Good, but not your best effort. Austin Powers 4? No thank you

Shag-happy superspy Austin Powers is back for the third installment of the spy-spoof franchise . Austin Powers (Mike Myers) travels back to the 70s to find his secret agent dad Nigel (Michael Caine) hook up with love interest . Upon learning that his father has been kidnapped, Austin Powers must travel to 1975 and defeat the aptly named villain Goldmember, who is working with Dr. Evil. Austin teams up with Foxxy Cleopatra (kitchy eye candy Beyoncé Knowles) in order to rescue the world and to foil his look-alike nemesis , Dr Evil . If he were any cooler, he'd still be frozen, baby!. Frozen in the 60's... thawing spring '97, baby!. Debonair. Defiant. Defrosted. On July 26th the Secret Will Be Exposed . He's still evil... He's still deadly... and he's still surrouded by frickin' idiots!. The grooviest movie of the summer has a secret, baby!. What do you call a swinger old enough to be your father? Daddy!. A New Breed of Evil.Hilarious and non-sense spoof of 60s spy and babe films . A festival of scatological humor, crushed velvet , political incorrectness , bad taste and silliness . Myers revels in playing the fool old-snaggle tooth, and he may step over the line every once in a while , but he gets plenty of mileage out of the one-joke premise . Myers wisely highlights the not-so-good Goldmember , along with other roles , instead of the periodically wearisome Powers . Myers again takes on numerous characters , this time adding a new villain Goldmember , a Disco-clad Dutchman with a gilded prosthetic and a penchant for world domination. Dr Evil is in good form but soft newcomer Goldmember comes up short and Myers is running out of fun ideas . MGM studios raised a stink about the title , too close to James Bond's Goldfinger , but finally saw the light and allowed the parody to continue. The motion picture was regularly directed by Jay Roach and in similar style than previous entries. Rating : 5/10 . Mediocre but it all still works because of Myers 's winking nice nature .The trilogy is as follows : Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) by Jay Roach with Mike Myers , Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York , Mimi Rogers, Robert Wagner , Seth Green, Fabiana Udenio. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) by Jay Roach with Heather Graham , Michael York , Robert Wagner, Rob Lowe , Seth Green, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, Elizabeth Hurley, Gia Carides. And Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) with Beyoncé Knowles, Seth Green, Michael York , Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling, Verne Troyer, Michael Caine, Fred Savage .

The first Austin Powers film was so fresh, zany, charming, witty and  unique.  It took some time for many people to catch on (hence it's legendary  video rental record), but it was dazzlingly, mesmerizingly adorable.  The sequel came out and rather tarnished the prior film by either  dumping or revising various story elements and especially by taking a  turn towards the crude and vulgar. Still, it had it's share of  interesting moments and laughs. In this third installment, the goodwill  is almost completely gone. What remains is a hopelessly indulgent,  often foul and unfunny conglomeration of "jokes" and gags, many based  on bodily functions or other off-key subjects. That is not to say that  the film doesn't still deliver quite a few laughs. It's just that by  now, the whole enterprise seems very worn and familiar. There are  several truly funny sequences in the film, but mostly it is saved only  by some surprising and "right on" star cameos and the fresh appeal of  Knowles. The (typically) ludicrous plot kicks off with Powers having to  rescue his father (Caine) from the title character by travelling (too  briefly) to 1975. Then the whole parade of series characters is  involved in either starting or stopping the world's total destruction.  Myers is undeniably brilliant at creating various characters and giving  them each a voice of his own. He succeeds in creating these people who  seem real unto themselves. Unfortunately, he also is bent on catering  to what has to be a 13-year-old boy target audience with endless,  endless potty jokes and gross out gags. Some of them are very amusing.  Some of them are just gross. After a short while it becomes overkill.  Knowles (who is certainly no "actress") comes across as very attractive  and surprisingly charismatic on film. Her character is mostly  decorative, but she serves the purpose very, VERY well. Her  take-no-prisoners attitude is refreshing, even if she is continuously  shown being kicked in the face. By now, Myers is so much the whole show  that previous supporting cast members (Sterling, Green, Wagner, York)  can barely get a word in. Who knows how much of their stuff was cut in  the hour-plus of leftover material, but certainly plenty of Myers was  left in. It's hard to imagine the lengthier cut because this one seems  interminable, even with the bright spots. The opening sequence is  brilliant. The character named Dixie......hilarious full name. Other  creative and funny bits occur throughout, but the film can not escape  it's pall of crudeness and alienating self-indulgence.

When films series reach their third instalment, many bolts and nuts start to come lose . However this is not a case with Goldmember which shows us that Austin Powers still has his Mojo. The horny spy is back. He may of lost some of his freshness but there no doubt he still delivers. If anything gold member is possibly the best instalment in the series.Mike Myers is still great as Austin powers. Just like the last two, he does the usually stuff you come to expect that's including making you horny. Micheal Cane also makes an appearance as Austin's dad which to me, was brilliant. The gags are what you expect from Austin, as one or two gags are reused from previous films but despite this they are still hilarious . Basically, Goldmember is everything you expect. Dr evil, his evil henchman, Mini me, Fat bastard, scotty are all still major characters.Now when it came to beyonce being Foxy, Mr Powers sexy partner, i was on the fence. Beyonce to me, wasn't the best choice but then again, she just there so that Austin can still crack a rude joke now and then. The arrival of The Dutch was flat. seeing as he plays a big part in the film, he is easily forgettable compared to other characters. Even though the gags still make me laugh, they are easily associated with the gags from the previous two films as there only several of new, unique gags.Goldmember is another proud entry into the series which still shows that Austin is still groovy and has got plenty going for him. Despite reused gags, he can still make you laugh out loud which makes me come to the conclusion that Austin Powers is now one of movies biggest icons and after watching him for over four hours now on all three films, I don't care if i watch him for another four hours in new material because Austin always delivers and Goldmember proves this The same goes for Dr evil, i hope i'll still be here when he up to destroying the world for the hundredth time.

Weakest of the three in my opinion, but 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' still has some memorable moments.I enjoyed the star-studded and cameo-filled opening scene, it's well done. Mike Myers is again great in his roles, especially Dr. Evil, and Beyoncé Knowles is a positive addition. The stuff with Dr. Evil isn't as good as in the 1999 film, yet he still made me laugh a few times; he does have one of the series' best moments with the rendition of the Jay-Z song.However, I did feel a few pacing issues. All in all, it's still worth a watch. As noted, the cameos are solid - and let's just say they chose the perfect actor to play Dr. Evil...

Here we are into the third installment of "Austin Powers" and sadly it is wearing thin. We don't have the same originality that the first one brought or the usually funny jokes. Now while the ideas were good and it seemed strong, it just didn't give.The beginning is classic and it seemed like this was going to be great. I mean, we have Tom Cruise playing Austin Powers, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, John Travolta as Goldmember, and Danny Devito as Mini Me in the Austin Powers movie! Just great and brilliant. But then the actual movie starts, Felicity is not here for no explained reason and Austin is single. Leading him to Foxxy Cleopatra, played by Beyonce and is way too stereotypical. Fat Bastard is also back and tries too hard with his disgusting jokes that fall flat.Dr. Evil is still pretty funny, but again just loosing his touch. We have a brilliant idea of Michael Caine as Austin's dad, but it's a hit and miss with Caine's dull performance. Goldmember, also played by Myers, is just too disgusting and tries too hard to impress the audience as another funny villain. Scott has now decided to take over the family business, which takes his cool and unique style away. :( Mini Me is push aside then from Dr. Evil and he joins up with Austin to try again for that "shocking and ironic" laugh of him now being a Mini Austin. The ending is just ridicules.I'm sorry, this just didn't amuse me that much. The jokes were overused and not funny any more. There are too many stereotypical performances in here and the only thing worth watching is the beginning with the amazing cameo's. That was unforgettable, but the rest is just a skip. So, pass on this one, guys, it's not worth your time really.6/10-and 4 points of that goes to the beginning!

I've said this before, and I'll type it again: only see this Austin Powers sequel once.While Austin Powers in Goldmember has its moments, such as the terrific opening credit scene (the best so far,) they are so few and far between making some of this movie's unbearable.I didn't heed to my own warning, and this is the second time I've seen it. But, then, I don't like to write reviews on movies I haven't seen in awhile. This one being almost 7½ years.This time out, I got tricked. After being somewhat disappointed in Austin Powers: The Spy That Shagged Me – comparatively speaking to the brilliant Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, I was pumped up after the now-established opening dance scene. And I thought this would bring the series back on track. Unfortunately, it only goes straight downhill after that.Austin captures Dr. Evil immediately in this chapter, but learns through a Hannibal Lecter/Magneto meeting that another Mike Myers's creation, Goldmember, is on the loose to cause havoc. Austin must race, literally, back in time, this time in the 1970's, to thwart Goldmember's plans. Back to the year 2002 he goes and everyone's where they're supposed to be situated to make an Austin Powers movie.A few things have changed: Austin's dad (Caine) plays an important role, Scott becomes more evil while the always-scene-stealer Mini-Me loses some and more history of Austin and Dr. Evil's past is revealed.Sure, the movie has its moments. Some parts I did laugh out loud. But for the most part, it was definitely getting stale, the jokes recycled and the newest, uh, member, Goldmember ,was unbearable to watch. Yeah, I know a lot of humor is gross-out jokes, but when he eats his skin (sorry, I never caught that spoof/reference) it's beyond nasty.Again, it's worth maybe one viewing, but I have to almost say skip this one and pray, if they make a part IV, they'll attempt to reboot the series back to its hilarious roots. At least come up with some new jokes.

Fabulous film, and thoroughly made the world we live in seem a happier place 😀 I think people need more of this kind of comedy to shine a light through our current political and interpersonal meltdown...Austin Powers in Goldmember makes you laugh like before you mistrusted people, and smile like before you first looked behind the curtain.Class act... please make more 😄

When I first saw the reviews of this movie, the trailers and the previews in the theater, I thought, "Oh wow, has Austin Powers lost its edge." But I was misled by the "teaser" trailers. I did not, as a result, see this movie in the theater, but instead waited for it to come out on video.My loss.This is by FAR, the best Austin Powers movie yet. This is supposed to be the last installment, the concluding chapter of the trilogy, as it were, but I hope that is not the case.Beonce was wonderful as Foxy. She's no Heather Graham, but that could be a good thing.This movie is wonderfully entertaining, with the original cast members of the first two (a rarity), and some nice surprises.It gets a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.

If you howled (as I did) at THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, stick in the DVD and watch it again. The experience will be far better than seeing this "new" film made up of old gags. The theory seems to be that if several poopoo, teetee and fart jokes were funny, then ten times more of them will be ten times funnier. Uh-uh: it works in inverse proportion. The sole laugh-out-loud I had from this film was a piece of stock footage of a chimp falling out of a tree. The jokes telegraph themselves from miles away, the dialogue is horrible, and the plot...wait, what plot? On paper it would seem like a brainstorming session that no one bothered to write a first draft of. The shadow bit from SHAGGED ME is repeated, as is the bit with Dr. Evil's space ship/satellite/whatever being misidentified as giant body parts, and lots of other bits are rehashed as well. How in God's name is this getting the reviews it's been getting? Has our sense of humor sunk to such a dreadfully low level that we chortle at lists of euphemisms for male genitalia? To their credit, the audience I was with didn't laugh much either. Maybe you can't fool all of the people all of the time. I'd love to see word of mouth kill this puppy in the coming weeks. Ooo. Bad. So very very bad.

Mike Myers returns for the third installment of his "Austin Powers" franchise.  In "Goldmember," he comes full circle with the histories of Austin and Dr. Evil.  Myers again plays shagadelic secret agent Austin Powers, his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil and horrible henchman Fat Bastard, and now also a new bad guy, the Dutch hedonist Goldmember.  I found this movie hilarious and outrageous!  It had a lot of crude humor, like Austin hiding behind Mr. Roboto's fountain.  But there was also a good amount of self-parody.  The best scenes included Dr. Evil's prison rap video, and the suggestive subtitles in Mr. Roboto's office.  The several cameos were also enjoyable, especially Ozzy Osbourne pointing out the joke carried over from "The Spy Who Shagged Me."  The scene with Godzilla and its copyright was a relevant joke, considering the MPAA's temporary ban on the use of the title "Goldmember."  I did have a complaint about the continuity.  The difference in Austin Powers' trademark "choppers" was noticeable.  And although I'd have liked an explanation for the absence of Felicity Shagwell, I'm glad she was not revealed in the movie as a fembot!  Anyway, with this third installment, Austin Powers goes out with a bang!

The first two Austin Powers movies were brilliant, but "Goldmember" is where the cracks are beginning to show.  The first half is really funny ("Master Evil" "Fook Mi" etc.) but the characters get old pretty fast, and Goldmember, the Dutch villain, just isn't funny.  Part of the problem is that we're too familiar with Austin, Dr. Evil, Mini Me, etc., and part of it is the 1960's spy formula is wearing thin.  I hope this is the last one, the first two are great and worth seeing, but see this one only if you must see the third installment.  6 out of 10.

The movie started not how I expected with Tom Cruise playing as Austin Powers in a fictional movie based on him which I think would've been better than the actual movie. As you would expect from Austin Powers movies the plot is crazy, but the plot was so much crazier that it didn't really matter if you followed it or not. Whether you like this movie or not is based on how many jokes there are and how funny the movie is and although there were a few funny moments, it was not as funny as the first movie. Can someone explain why Beyonce was in the movie because I felt like her role felt pointless and she didn't portray her character as well as Austin's love interests in the previous 2 movies.
