Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!"Jesus, the music scene's gone to h3ll since I've been dead!" ChuckyWe needed the levity, as the doll thing's getting old. The added comedic element, and the better action scenes brings this one back up to equal the quality of the first, when the idea was fresh and new-ish.6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.

I'm not sure what I should think about director Ronny Yu. Either he provides the genre of horror with the new wind it needed or he is a below average comedian who tries to be funny by spoofing the big titles in the genre. At this moment he is working about Freddy vs Jason which brings the 2 perhaps most famous horror icons, together on the screen and in 1998 he brought us this 3rd sequel in the Child's Play series. I'm not saying he did a bad job on this Bride of Chucky. Not at all, actually. The Child's Play films were never great. The first one from 1988 was original and fun. It went downhill from there. The second one had its moments (a few) and the third one was barely watchable. If you look at it that way, Bride of Chucky is a good film. It's not required to have seen all the sequels. If you know how Charles Lee Ray ended up in the body op a doll, you can easily watch this film. It kinda picks up on the social life that Charles Lee Ray left behind when he died. His girlfriend from back then finally found the dolly (or what's left of it) and brings Chucky back to life. Bride of Chucky has a few gore and bloody moments but it's definitely more of a comedy. The whole film is built around the funny personality that is Chucky. He's a sarcastic, woman-hating, psychotic doll and that provides the movie with lots of quote material. All the little easter eggs make this movie funny as well. If you don't like the story, try to amuse yourself by searching all the references to famous horror film. That should keep you busy too. I wouldn't have mind if Child's Play 3 never received a sequel, to be honest. But if it did have to happen and that's most likely in Hollywood, I'm glad it turned out to be something like this. Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky. This guy is great. If you're not familiar with his name or work, look him up. He played some of the greatest villains in movie history. The girl, Tiffany is a good role for Jennifer Tilly. She has the most irritating voice possible but that turns out as a great advantage for the character she plays here. In conclusion, the movie isn't ashamed to admit it's based on Bride Of Frankenstein and will provide you 90 minutes of good laughs. I'm not saying it's a great film but you won't regret spending time watching it.

Well, as you can see, everyone's favorite blue overalls-wearing psychopathic doll has survived for a fourth installment. An excellent fourth installment, at that. I was very impressed with this one, especially after the "dullness" of Part 3 that got me completely bored that I doubted that there would even be any more sequels. . . Boy, was I wrong. But it just seems that in "Bride of Chucky" you actually feel some chemistry going on between him and Tiffany. Not only that, but it always seems that in the "Child's Play" series you could never really tell if Chucky's dead or not, whether he's shot in the heart, exploded into bits of pieces, or hacked up in a huge fan.This film also includes some memorable scenes, for example, the stunning segment where that guy gets blown to bits by getting hit by that huge truck. Pure genius from the film's screenwriter, and creator of characters, Don Mancini.Yes, shocking was the movie, the ending especially. Some good dialogue, a great plotline, pulse pounding suspense, and a hard-hitting soundtrack, "Bride of Chucky" promises everything the previews do and may become a famous pick-out in the horror genre. Highly reccomended for die-hard fans of the "Child's Play" series.

Stupid, unbelievable, cheesy, violence, blood, inventive killings, and a HOT Jennifer Tilly, what more could you ask for? Now does this plot really make sense? Hell no! Why the hell does chucky need to kill tiff to put her into a female doll to then go and get the amulet so they can then go back into human bodies? Thats the plot and it doesn't make sense, why not just keep her alive so she can go drive to get the amulet, yet there's the fact that chuck is a possessed doll in the first place...Anyway, it keeps you entertained the whole way through without bad stupid slow parts or any padding, this is a bad movie, there are worse movies, but if you like bad horror movies, and the chucky films, (I don't really like the first ones) you'll like this.

I first saw this in the late 90s on cable tv n found it to be very bad.
Revisited it recently since I am on a Chucky marathon.
This part was released aft a gap of seven years but the events in this film takes place immediately one month aft the previous part wher Chucky got killed by a giant fan. So this time Chucky is brought back to life once again not by chance but by a former lover Tiffiny thru the same mumbo jumbo stuff. Aft some heated arguments, Chucky kills Tiffany n transfers her soul into a female doll n the rest is idiotic history.
This part is devoid of the scare n tension as the concept of a child in peril is totally removed. One of the kills may remind viewers of the Cenobite. The ceiling glass scene is totally ridiculous but the girl in that scene (Janet Kidder) is far more hotter than both the fatty's, Jennifer Tilly n Katherine Heigl.

After the extreme downer of CP3, Ronny Yu's highly silly 90's tendencies are exactly what Chucky needed. A wonderfully insane and highly entertaining horror comedy, that presupposes all the slasher movies exist in the same universe and thankfully gives us John Ritter's version of Pinhead.

As post-modern, self-referential horror comedies go, this one isn't bad. With a tongue firmly in cheek, BRIDE OF CHUCKY is definitely more comedy than horror. As a horror film, it's a total failure, with a string of gory murders having little impact on the viewer. It could be viewed as a shining example of all that's wrong with the genre at the moment - a lack of the real understanding of horror. As a comedy, though, there are plenty of laughs to be had from the two bickering dolls and the amusing storyline which recalls NATURAL BORN KILLERS. Another plus is that it's an improvement on the previous sequels in the series - but then what couldn't be? Besides, how can you not laugh at a film where two dolls share a very intimate scene?The violence here is played for laughs and there's a lot of it. The puppet animation is rather good too, coming from old hand Kevin Yagher. Coming after SCREAM, there are lots of references to horror films, as you would expect. The obvious influence here, though, is THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, seen playing on television at one point.Brad Dourif returns as the voice of the foul-mouthed doll, Chucky. However it's Jennifer Tilly who provides the most laughs as his bad-tempered and psychotic companion, Tiffany, both in human and doll form. Other characters come and go (usually in bloody ways) and make little impact, apart from the leads playing the teenage couple - the usual flawless and talentless young actors. Apart from this, the plot is contrived and hopeless, and far too simplistic. The film works best when focusing on the love/hate banter between Chucky and Tiffany. It's worth a few laughs, but viewers looking for serious horror should go elsewhere as this is just the latest in a long line of recent lame-brain good-to-look-at glossy films catering for the mainstream crowd.

I honestly was going give this movie a lower rating, But I also remembered that this movie introduced Tiffany. Tiffany was actually a pretty good killer introduced. I hope they give her own movie. It would be very interesting to see. And this movie is where they put comedy into the Chucky Franchise. I don't really hate this movie, just don't like a lot

The soul of Satanic serial killer Charles Lee Ray is, by misfortune, incarcerated in the body of a seemingly innocuous doll. Ray's long time girlfriend, Tiffany (the seductive Jennifer Tilly) has found a book titled "Voodoo for Dummies." Now, she has called on the spirits of Hell to revive this left-for-dead doll...and to make him alive and well again!When everything is botched in a misconstrued matter...Tiffany imminently finds herself in the body of another plastic doll as well. The two notorious murderers, known for their multiple crimes, fall in love again...and the world needs a prayer...Yes, Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) the killer doll is back...and he's out for anyone's blood! Chucky's new bride Tiffany has also found herself enjoying all the twisted, creative murders Chucky has made. Chucky and Tiffany have one goal: to retrieve the "Heart of Omzilla," an amulet that will thus allow both of them to return to their former human selves...You better watch out! Chucky is no more mister nice guy!BRIDE OF CHUCKY is a sinister guilty pleasure! The Chucky franchise earns its much desperately needed (and deserved) revision. Thanks to Ronny Yu's (who has directed so many Hong Kong martial arts films) direction and the wizardry of special FX make-up artist Kevin Yagher, Chucky is livelier...and deadlier than ever. Yagher does a great job giving Chucky such human traits and attributes. Chucky is one demonic and realistic character whom I would NOT like to run into in a dark alley! Chucky himself looks especially deformed, with the appropriate stitches on his face and everything. For a pint size villain, he packs one mean attitude! Also, the facial expressions of the killer puppets Chucky and Tiffany are so bizarre, yet wonderfully genuine. One fact for sure, I was impressed by all the elaborate special effects... Hey, you must also adore the cogent and delightfully deviant love-hate relationship between Chucky and Tiffany.John Ritter (!) is excellent (though unusually cast against type) as an uncompromising Security Chief Officer. Ritter should also earn an award for the best (and most unpredictable) demise. He certainly knows how to be dying in style! Brad Dourif really knows this Chucky character inside out. He delivers the wisecracks with impeccable timing before and after each killing. Alexis Arquette (THE WEDDING SINGER) is in top form as a "Goth" who encounters the devil doll. Jennifer Tilly is one fantastic, nefarious temptress.There's plenty of bloodletting in this pleasantly entertaining (and sleazy) thriller. Lots of gory murders abound to keep bloodhounds ingratiated. This grotesquely violent and sanguinary film will easily scare away the squeamish. In addition, there are lots of cool (and sometimes subtle) references alluding to other horror flicks. I also learned from this movie that a person should not take love for granted.BRIDE OF CHUCKY is an imaginative journey into everlasting terror. You will laugh and churn as you witness the brutal slayings as the consequences of this couple's rampage. If you appreciate dark, macabre humor, then this movie is perfect for you! By far the best film in this series. This movie is even better than the original CHILD'S PLAY ...RATING: **1/2 out of ****.

This is the fourth Child's play movie and it is very bad. The original Child's play is very scary. Child's play 2 is very scary. Child's play 3 is very scary. And this is an awful movie. Come on dolls that are possessed by ghost having sex. There is a scene in Child's play 2 were some toy maker rebuild him. They take off this pants because he was burned in first one. Nothing is there. The story line is awful. The ending is awful and makes no sense. Is not scary at all. Brad D.o.u.r.i.f is great actor. He wasted his talent being in this awful movie. Katherine H.e.i.g.l is a great actresses she wasted her talent being in this awful movie.

Bride of Chucky was by far the best of the series. Better than such tripe as Urban Legend and Disturbing Behavior mostly because it does not take itself too seriously. How serious can a killer doll be anyway? If you are looking for scares this will disappoint, but if you are looking for a few laughs and some gore this is your type of movie.

This movie is a JOKE this isn't a horror film, what an embarrassment!

Chucky's (at this point) heretofore unmentioned girlfriend Tiffany (a devilishly entertaining Jennifer Tilly) tracks down his remains, stitches him back together, and uses voodoo to revive him. Her ultimate "reward" is to end up in the exact same predicament as him. Now *both* of them go looking for donor bodies; also eager to satisfy their blood lust, they hit the road, involving two young lovers (Katherine Heigl, Nick Stabile) in their plans.Series creator Don Mancini clearly had the right idea in shifting the focus of the material to dark comedy. It provides the series with a breath of fresh air, with the supremely sexy Tilly likewise adding something interesting to the standard formula. The result is good chemistry between the Chucky & Tiffany characters, with a number of genuinely funny lines. Horror fans need not fret too much, however, as the murders do tend to be either very gory or literally explosive.Chucky voice provider Brad Dourif is in typically fine form, while Heigl and Stabile have a sufficient amount of appeal as the earnest couple caught up in the latest killing spree. Alexis Arquette is a hoot as a Goth dude who tries his best to get with Tiffany, and Gordon Michael Woolvett is likeable as the cliched gay best friend. Horror fans will note the presence of Lawrence Dane from the early 80s slasher "Happy Birthday to Me" as the pursuing cop, and it's highly amusing to see John Ritter here as Heigls' over-protective uncle, a police chief who puts the J-E-R-K in JERK. Kathy Najimy has a brief cameo as a maid.The doll effects are excellent as always, the pacing is very good, and Hong Kong-born filmmaker Ronny Yu (known previously for "The Bride with White Hair", and who would go on to direct "Freddy vs. Jason") is clearly having some fun with this. The kick-ass soundtrack (ranging from White Zombie to Slayer to Monster Magnet) is just the icing on the cake.One of the better entries in the series.Seven out of 10.

Ever since I saw it on opening day back in 1998, "Bride Of Chucky" has been a personal favorite of mine. I have been a big fan of the "Child's Play" franchise since I was about seven years old, and this movie pretty much sums up everything that makes a Chucky movie great. In this fourth installment, the focus is finally taken off of the saga of Andy Barclay (which was getting a bit played out by the end of "Child's Play 3"), and instead on Chucky and Tiffany, a previous flame who was with him up until his original death. After Tiffany (played to perfection by the wonderful Jennifer Tilly and her wonderful cleavage) finally gets a hold of Chucky's remains (basically a trash bag full of Chucky parts [see part 3]) and resurrects him with some strategic sewing, he turns on her and ends up passing her soul into another doll. Together, they hitch a ride with runaway couple Jesse and Jade (Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl) to New Jersey to find a stone that Chucky was wearing around his neck the day he died that will help resurrect them to human form. As you can predict, lots of hectic things happen on this road trip. Blood is spilled, pot is smoked and Chucky does indeed get lucky (in a hilarious and memorable scene that will be burned in your memory forever). Don Mancini, the creator of Chucky, writer of all three previous installments, returns as writer and fleshes out a beautifully demented and imaginative horror comedy. With the flare of director Ronny Yu (who would later go on to direct "Freddy Vs. Jason"), "Bride Of Chucky" is the best installment in the Chucky series thus far. Everything about this movie works. The death scenes are elaborate and somewhat comedic in parts, the music rocks (check out the soundtrack), and the story is so much fun, you just can't turn away in the 90 minutes this movie spans. Add that to a knock-out ending -- which leads us into the upcoming "Seed Of Chucky" (November 10th) -- and you have yourself the perfect Saturday night horror flick.10/10

Clever is the word that comes to mind when I think of the mixture of horror and comedy that makes up a good deal of BRIDE OF CHUCKY, much of the humor due to some good one-liners by Chucky (courtesy of BRAD DOURIF's voice). And JENNIFER TILLY does an exceptional job as a dim-witted, evil partner of the doll eventually turned into a doll herself who is just as manic as her boyfriend.NICK STABILE and KATHERINE HEIGL are the leads, the unsuspecting victims of much of the mayhem, who have to confront the evil they're dealing with which leads toward a cemetery in Hackensack where the evil dolls hope to retrieve an amulet from a corpse that will restore their original bodies.It's photographed expertly, well directed by Ronny Yu and there's an unusual amount of range to the expressions on both dolls that make them seem eerily real. The final scene in the cemetery is guaranteed to give you a final startled moment.JOHN RITTER plays his role as Police Chief Kinkaid with some restraint, but it's not much of a part until his gruesome demise.Summing up: Not bad as far as these sort of horror capers go.

Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky.

Apparently this is the fourth installment of the Chucky series. And Was I the only one who thought this movie was short? I liked the beginning of it, and how the main character, Tiffany, worked her voodoo powers to bring back her boyfriend from the dead. I also liked how much of a diabolical genius Chucky is, and how nobody suspected the dolls of the frequent murders. But as the movie reached its high point, it started getting lazier and more superficial. I was expecting a lot more people to get killed and more hell to break loose. However, towards the end nothing much happened other than the downfall of the bad guys. Overall it's an average movie that did not put me on the edge my seat.

There are people who laughed their head off with this and the makers of this movie are really proud of it. Even the actors are excited if you watch them in interviews talking about the movie. But I didn't feel the excitement. It's not really horror, it's not really comedy, it's a mix of both.A mix that doesn't entirely work out for me, but maybe it's something for you. If you're a fan of the series, you'll obviously gonna like it a bit more than I do.It's no necessary to know the other parts to understand the movie, but if you do, you might get a few more laughs out of it!

This is the best so far of all the Chucky films. It isn't that it has more story going on, but the addition of Jennifer Tilly makes it worth watching even if you don't like Chucky.Tilly's best role is unarguably Bound with Gina Gershon, but she has been thrilling us for years in such films as The Getaway and Dancing at the Blue Iguana. She thrills us again in this film and we take due notice.The film also stars "Grey's Anatomy"'s Katherine Heigl, who shows much better taste in men that she did on screen this year with Nick Stabile as her partner.Lots of laughs and a cool maniac in Chucky.

I first saw this in the late 90s on cable tv n found it to be very bad.
Revisited it recently since I am on a Chucky marathon.
This part was released aft a gap of seven years but the events in this film takes place immediately one month aft the previous part wher Chucky got killed by a giant fan.

The ceiling glass scene is totally ridiculous but the girl in that scene (Janet Kidder) is far more hotter than both the fatty's, Jennifer Tilly n Katherine Heigl.

I kind of find this funny that this is the only movie in series rated a 18.I didn't see any thing different from the one before (Child's Play 3) I not sure why it was 18, This movie did have some Doll nudity , (if that made you laugh you are on the right track LOL), Yes Chucky got lucky, which is the tag line of the movie anyway, back to story Tiffany ex- Girlfriend of Charles Lee Ray, rescues chucky remains and bring him back to life , Soon she regrets, has chucky kills her and transfer her soul into another doll.They both look for a new body to transfer there souls into and kills few people on way and also putting a young couple in the frame of murder. They have some good deaths scenes, this movie and acting was very good. This movie not scary,is just mindless gory fun 7/10 Very good movie

Chucky (the murderous doll from "Child's Play" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using "Voodoo for Dummies") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds. After the last two sequels to "Child's Play" (both of which were horrible) I was expecting the worst, but this actually was lots of fun. The movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second (seriously--how could it?) and the lines and situations are actually quite funny. Also there are a few VERY gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving. The movie also has a few things usually not found in a horror movie--a gay best friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which Stabile has his shirt off just to show his muscular body. John Ritter has a nice cameo too as a sheriff.The acting is good--Stabile is young, VERY handsome and likable; Heigl doesn't have much to do but pulls it off and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) and Tilly are hilarious as the murderous dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (don't ask) and she asks for a rubber and he responds, "But I'm MADE of rubber!" The special effects are good (no lousy CGI here) and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. Well worth seeing. I give it a 9.

After the extreme downer of CP3, Ronny Yu's highly silly 90's tendencies are exactly what Chucky needed. A wonderfully insane and highly entertaining horror comedy, that presupposes all the slasher movies exist in the same universe and thankfully gives us John Ritter's version of Pinhead.

This is the fourth Child's play movie and it is very bad. The original Child's play is very scary. Child's play 2 is very scary. Child's play 3 is very scary. And this is an awful movie. Come on dolls that are possessed by ghost having sex. There is a scene in Child's play 2 were some toy maker rebuild him. They take off this pants because he was burned in first one. Nothing is there. The story line is awful. The ending is awful and makes no sense. Is not scary at all. Brad D.o.u.r.i.f is great actor. He wasted his talent being in this awful movie. Katherine H.e.i.g.l is a great actresses she wasted her talent being in this awful movie.

I honestly was going give this movie a lower rating, But I also remembered that this movie introduced Tiffany. Tiffany was actually a pretty good killer introduced. I hope they give her own movie. It would be very interesting to see. And this movie is where they put comedy into the Chucky Franchise. I don't really hate this movie, just don't like a lot

Funny how?
There are people who laughed their head off with this and the makers of this movie are really proud of it. Even the actors are excited if you watch them in interviews talking about the movie. But I didn't feel the excitement. It's not really horror, it's not really comedy, it's a mix of both.A mix that doesn't entirely work out for me, but maybe it's something for you. If you're a fan of the series, you'll obviously gonna like it a bit more than I do.It's no necessary to know the other parts to understand the movie, but if you do, you might get a few more laughs out of it!

Chucky's (at this point) heretofore unmentioned girlfriend Tiffany (a devilishly entertaining Jennifer Tilly) tracks down his remains, stitches him back together, and uses voodoo to revive him. Her ultimate "reward" is to end up in the exact same predicament as him. Now *both* of them go looking for donor bodies; also eager to satisfy their blood lust, they hit the road, involving two young lovers (Katherine Heigl, Nick Stabile) in their plans.Series creator Don Mancini clearly had the right idea in shifting the focus of the material to dark comedy. It provides the series with a breath of fresh air, with the supremely sexy Tilly likewise adding something interesting to the standard formula. The result is good chemistry between the Chucky & Tiffany characters, with a number of genuinely funny lines. Horror fans need not fret too much, however, as the murders do tend to be either very gory or literally explosive.Chucky voice provider Brad Dourif is in typically fine form, while Heigl and Stabile have a sufficient amount of appeal as the earnest couple caught up in the latest killing spree. Alexis Arquette is a hoot as a Goth dude who tries his best to get with Tiffany, and Gordon Michael Woolvett is likeable as the cliched gay best friend. Horror fans will note the presence of Lawrence Dane from the early 80s slasher "Happy Birthday to Me" as the pursuing cop, and it's highly amusing to see John Ritter here as Heigls' over-protective uncle, a police chief who puts the J-E-R-K in JERK. Kathy Najimy has a brief cameo as a maid.The doll effects are excellent as always, the pacing is very good, and Hong Kong-born filmmaker Ronny Yu (known previously for "The Bride with White Hair", and who would go on to direct "Freddy vs. Jason") is clearly having some fun with this. The kick-ass soundtrack (ranging from White Zombie to Slayer to Monster Magnet) is just the icing on the cake.One of the better entries in the series.Seven out of 10.

This movie is a JOKE this isn't a horror film, what an embarrassment!

Bride of Chucky was by far the best of the series. Better than such tripe as Urban Legend and Disturbing Behavior mostly because it does not take itself too seriously. How serious can a killer doll be anyway? If you are looking for scares this will disappoint, but if you are looking for a few laughs and some gore this is your type of movie.

Acting: **/*****Plot: */*****Direction: */*****Storyline: **/*****Overall: **/*****This is such a mediocre film with crappy acting and crappy direction, everything about it is crap. There are some decent moments but it never gets above average.At best this movie is awful. The blood and gore is stupid and no one who gets knocked over by a truck gets splattered into a million pieces. This is just another poorly put-together movie with no actual meaning. The only reason this gets a 4/10 instead of a lower score is the ending, which may spawn another sequel. Only see this movie if you are a true horror movie fan or are a maniac doll.4/10If you like this try:Childs Play 1,2,3,4Scary MovieBasic Instinct

They obviously made "Bride of Chucky" with the aim of impressing only people who really like slashers. It doesn't disappoint in that sense. To be certain, they're clearly playing everything for laughs. As the title explains, Chucky (voice of Brad Dourif) takes on a mate (Jennifer Tilly)...and she's as much of a wise-cracker as he is.Yes, these movies have no real point. They're just excuses to show people getting killed. But they're so much fun! The best scene is easily the sex scene. Number 2 is the glass scene. But whatever the case, this is one movie that you're sure to enjoy - assuming that you've decided in advance that you like it. Really cool.Also starring John Ritter and Katharine Heigl.

Have an appreciation for the horror genre, although there is a preference for other genres. Mainly watched 'Bride of Chucky' having decided to recently watch and review all the films in the 'Child's Play'/Chucky series, having been intrigued for a long time by Chucky the doll's horror icon status, a deserved distinction.Do feel that the character himself is better than the films, as has been said before. Having said that, enough of the films are watchable and a few are even good. 'Bride of Chucky' is one of the good ones. It is not the very best of the 'Child's Play'/Chucky films, it for me will always be the original. It is though one of the best and one of the franchise's most entertaining. Was expecting it to be really dumb, weird and near-intelligence insulting, as the premise sort of indicated, 'Bride of Chucky' by some miracle managed to be neither.There are faults in 'Bride of Chucky' but actually there is not an awful lot wrong. The story is extremely lightweight and tends to be predictable and at times contrived. There is occasionally some clunky dialogue and some characters are more interesting than others.Pacing is not always secure, again with a rushed feel in spots.However, 'Bride of Chucky' looks slick and suitably ominous and the special effects are far from underwhelming, they blend very well, look eerily life-like and move easily. Quite great in fact. The music fits very well and is suitably haunting. Ronny Yu's direction is suitably colourful and of all the directing jobs for me it is second to the original 'Child's Play' in terms of the most personality and panache.Chucky's lines are like in the first two films, darkly witty and clever with one-liners that are smart, frighteningly sarcastic and entertainingly twisted. 'Bride of Chucky' is one of the better scripted 'Child's Play'/Chucky films, with its wicked humour, irresistibly entertaining interplay between Chucky and Tiffany and witty classic past and present horror film references. Intimacy has rarely been more hilarious. Some may not like that 'Bride of Chucky' takes more of a wickedly comedic route rather than providing lots of scares, it wasn't a problem for me and that it went that route was what makes it stand out amongst the rest of the 'Child's Play'/Chucky films. Like the first 'Child's Play', it mostly avoided going the cheesy, goofy and formulaic route that it could easily have done considering the premise.'Bride of Chucky' does have some creepiness despite the more comedic tone, with some genuinely unsettling set pieces. Chucky is an ever unforgettable character, the writers, Brad Dourif and the effects team clearly let loose and had a great time. 'Bride of Chucky' is one of the better acted films in the franchise, with appealing performances from John Ritter and Katherine Heigl in a relatively early role.Even better are the performances for Chucky and Tiffany. Am not usually the biggest fan of Jennifer Tilly, but she is hard to resist here and matches Dourif's Chucky in the darkly wise-cracking stakes. The biggest acting plus though once again is Dourif, again personifying malevolence and is also wickedly funny.Overall, well worth watching and one of the best in the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Feeling that the "Childs Play" series had garnered itself a little too much adverse publicity since its inception, the makers of this one decided to change tack and approach the material with an almost exclusive comedy angle. Sure, it still has gore; but as far as I'm concerned, you CAN have a comedy that's gory. Maybe that's a worrying indication of exactly WHAT makes me laugh. Not to worry, though because nary a titter was to be raised from me whilst watching "Bride of Chucky". It's more one long giant in-joke than a film, and the joke sucks. Did we really need the series to get any sillier than it already was? I don't think so. It's honestly as if the makers got bored of doing horror and decided that they wanted to make an X rated episode of "The Simpsons" instead, only without ANY of the originality...A pal and I had rented this to veg out in front of with a few beers. In those circumstances, you WANT to like a film; but try as I might, I couldn't and still can't muster up any good feeling toward this.So it's a parody of sorts. Isn't a walking, talking and killing cherubic doll parody enough? Obviously not. The people behind this can't even stick to lampooning their own created universe, they've got to impinge on ones imagined by others as well. The snide reference to Freddy/Michael/Jason et al at the beginning only serves to illustrate how out of its league this film is. Comparing this film to any of them (Even "Friday the Thirteenth Part 26: Jason Buys a Golfing Umbrella to Protect Him from a Shower of Nubile Teen Blood" - coming to a cinema near you soon kids!) in a favourable light is surely asking to be laughed out onto the streets.The kids in the movie are just 'cool'. They can't be bothered to be witty (Musn't be seen to upstage the plastic props, must we?) As far as I can remember, not one of them displays a smidgen of talent between them. Don't fret, however, this even extends to the adults too. It's almost as bad as the lead character in part 3 (Justin, was he called?) But not quite.Thus, we are left to rely on the 'mutant Ken and Barbie' for our yucks. To be fair, it is neither the fault of Dourif or Tilly that things are this bad, but there is only so much they can do in such a haphazard production. Tilly even acquits herself quite well, enough to suggest that she is right for the part, and that the concept itself may have worked better in different hands. She deserved (and got) another shot at the role. Unfortunately, this necessitates a sequel. If it's as bad as this one, it may just be the last film I ever watch. Suicide being more preferable. It MUST be cackhanded treatment of the possible material by Yu and the writers; because as I said, Tilly is great. There is even ONE good moment (count it!) By the time we reach the ending though - 'Tiffany' the doll' going through the agonies of childbirth - I'd had about all I could take of such abject stupidness and blatant non-acting by most of the cast, doll pair excepted.The "Childs Play" series was tootling along fine until the needless aberrations that were parts 3 & 4. On the evidence of the latter, it can only get worse. Leave it alone now, eh? I would've said different, had this one actually been any good; but it wasn't, not by a long chalk. ... and don't even get me started on the dolls having sex...(EDIT: On 28th of June 2006 I got to see "Seed of Chucky"... As expected, it makes the same mis-steps as its predecessor. There is no reason to recommend it if you find yourself agreeing with my dislike of this, because its problems are only exaggerated to worse effect. The distinguishing feature between the two is that what passes for 'satire' isn't even consistent anymore after the six-year wait... I took a raincheck on the idea of offing myself, but neither foray into the realm of send-ups is worth the time, by my estimation.)

Ever since I saw it on opening day back in 1998, "Bride Of Chucky" has been a personal favorite of mine. I have been a big fan of the "Child's Play" franchise since I was about seven years old, and this movie pretty much sums up everything that makes a Chucky movie great. In this fourth installment, the focus is finally taken off of the saga of Andy Barclay (which was getting a bit played out by the end of "Child's Play 3"), and instead on Chucky and Tiffany, a previous flame who was with him up until his original death. After Tiffany (played to perfection by the wonderful Jennifer Tilly and her wonderful cleavage) finally gets a hold of Chucky's remains (basically a trash bag full of Chucky parts [see part 3]) and resurrects him with some strategic sewing, he turns on her and ends up passing her soul into another doll. Together, they hitch a ride with runaway couple Jesse and Jade (Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl) to New Jersey to find a stone that Chucky was wearing around his neck the day he died that will help resurrect them to human form. As you can predict, lots of hectic things happen on this road trip. Blood is spilled, pot is smoked and Chucky does indeed get lucky (in a hilarious and memorable scene that will be burned in your memory forever). Don Mancini, the creator of Chucky, writer of all three previous installments, returns as writer and fleshes out a beautifully demented and imaginative horror comedy. With the flare of director Ronny Yu (who would later go on to direct "Freddy Vs. Jason"), "Bride Of Chucky" is the best installment in the Chucky series thus far. Everything about this movie works. The death scenes are elaborate and somewhat comedic in parts, the music rocks (check out the soundtrack), and the story is so much fun, you just can't turn away in the 90 minutes this movie spans. Add that to a knock-out ending -- which leads us into the upcoming "Seed Of Chucky" (November 10th) -- and you have yourself the perfect Saturday night horror flick.10/10
