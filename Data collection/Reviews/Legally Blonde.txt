I didn't go into "Legally Blonde" expecting too much. I rarely go to actual movie theaters to see a film (I usually rent videos/DVDs), but I got an advance on this one, and I was kind of sad it had to be this film I was going to see, but I had been invited along with two other people to see it and I wasn't going to say "no" for no reason. So I went. One of the persons I went with just wanted to see Reese Witherspoon in a Playboy bunny costume, so I figured I was in for another average run-'o-the-mill sex comedy. But I was very surprised with the outcome.So many girl-power comedies these days are made just for the sake of trying to prove a point that women are equals to men (I suppose that's the message behind it--what else was "Now and Then" made for?) and/or support for women. Fortunately, the 2001 hit "Legally Blonde" is not only a pleasant surprise, but an intelligent film, as well. (Sorry, that was my main "gripper" for this review and I had to leave it in.) Reese Witherspoon plays California sorority girl Elle Woods. Unlike other people her age that are worrying about grades in school, Elle only worries about what toilet paper is the softest. But after her boyfriend dumps her and goes off to Harvard Law School, Elle is determined to go to Harvard and get her man back. So after putting together a very shallow video for the chairmen of Harvard, they accept her into the prestige college (because of her innocent sexuality, no doubt, as we see them gaping at Elle in a bathing suit on the video), and she packs her bags and heads off to Harvard with her little dog Bruiser; as the ads say, "Boldly Going Where No Blonde Has Gone.""Legally Blonde" doesn't give up on the plot and completely divulge into dumb blonde/sex jokes. This film not only has a funny--if ridiculous--plot, but the jokes are, surprisingly, NOT crude sexual jokes. This film is not another "Scary Movie" made for teens: It has divinely orchestrated comic timing. Sometimes the plot gets a bit too heavy--the whole teacher-hitting-on-Elle thing is a bit stereotypical for a film like this--but in the long run it seems to break away from the typical girl-power comedy.
Reese Witherspoon tends to play the same characters a lot, but hey, if she can pull them off, good for her. I don't mind if all her characters tend to be the same (to a certain extent) because they tend to be quite funny and cute--who can't laugh at her Elle Woods persona? The film has a very nice co-star cast: Victor Garber ("Titanic," "Sleepless in Seattle"), Luke Wilson ("Blue Streak," "Charlie's Angels"), and Selma Blair ("The Sweetest Thing," A Guy Thing"--pretty much anyTHING).In the end, not only does "Legally Blonde" come off very funny, but also very witty, good-natured and sweet: One of the most pleasant surprises of 2001, indeed.4/5 stars -John Ulmer

"Legally Blonde" is all about Witherspoon as a totally val blonde from Beverly Hills who goes to Harvard and makes good. Predictable formula fun, "LB" gets off to a good start with the freshness of "Clueless", pushes its own envelope of believability in the middle, and ends with a major feel good moment. Along the way, this fun family flick makes some good points about life's priorities. Enjoyable stuff for 13 and up.

It would seem strange for me to like a "pleasant" summer comedy, but I think this one is actually watchable and even gives laughs sometimes.  It is John Grisham meets um, should I say Clueless?  A ditzey yet very smart college girl gets dumped by her boyfriend, and figures out that if she becomes a law student and perhaps even a laywer, she might win him back (even after she realizes he's engaged).  Clumsy at times and of course cliched (aren't they all nowadays), but also fun in a brainless dead-zone way. B

Blonde sorority queen Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is dumped by her politically-ambitious boyfriend because she's "a Marilyn, not a Jackie." So she enrolls in Harvard Law School in hopes of proving to him she is smart and winning him back. Reese is charming and lovely as ever. It's impossible to dislike her in this movie. Holland Taylor, Victor Garber, Luke Wilson, Selmer Blair, Matthew Davis, and Ali Larter are all part of the wonderful supporting cast. Jennifer Coolidge is the movie's scene stealer, which will probably come as no surprise to anyone who's seen her in anything. Well-paced with a good script and solid direction. It overcomes its predictable elements and exceeds expectations. Sure it's light and fluffy but there's nothing wrong with that. It's the kind of movie that puts a smile on your face right from the start and never lets you down.

Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again.  In fact, let me help you:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out `Legally Blonde,' a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her `frivolous' curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the `serious' of the `upper crust' elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears. With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any `shallowness' around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.	Make no mistake, this is one funny movie-- in fact, it's downright hilarious at times.  But beyond the laughter it evokes, there's a flip side to the same coin.  Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film, and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain `mold,' or coincide with someone else's `opinions' of the way things should be, will be able to identify with Elle's situation.  And it's something you have to be aware of, because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff, at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless, heartless, unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her. At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding, but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you.  Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion?  So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye; `dumb blonde' jokes get nipped in the bud, and by using a comedy format, the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining, but thoroughly thought-provoking, as well.
	Reese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle; she conveys such a full-of-life spirit that it is easy to empathize with her, and when the hurt comes, you feel it with her.  And through it all, the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation.  On one hand, when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop, it makes for a falling-on-the-floor moment of hilarity, and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin, as well.  And it makes you root for her all the more.  Witherspoon has a perky, vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part, and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person.  When she gets knocked down, you feel for her; and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground. There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie, and it's one of the best performances of her career.	The supporting cast includes Luke Wilson (Emmett), Selma Blair (Vivian), Victor Garber (Professor Callahan), Jennifer Coolidge (Paulette), Holland Taylor (Professor Stromwell), Ali Larter (Brooke Taylor-Windham), Jessica Cauffiel (Margot), Linda Cardellini (Chutney), Alanna Ubach (Serena) and Oz Perkins (Dorky David), with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  An entertaining, accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message, `Legally Blonde' can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes, but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature. Not always, but occasionally, a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface, and this is one of them.  What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh, while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships.  It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

"Legally Blonde" may not be the funniest movie I've ever seen, but it might just be the most cheerful one. Everything about it is just so damn sparkly. If you can watch this movie without cracking a smile, you're somehow even more of a cynical bastard than I am. The story isn't too inspired and you see pretty much every plot element coming from a mile away but who the hell cares, that's just the movie's way of staying in your comfort zone. Of course she's going to choose the right guy in the end, of course she's going to win the case: nobody would want it any other way. Even Jennifer "what the face" Coolidge can't ruin this movie, that's how charming it really is. Prepare to fall in love.

Legally Blonde finds Reese Witherspoon in one of her breakthrough roles as sorority queen Elle Woods who is dumped by her preppy boyfriend Matthew Davis. He's moving on to Harvard Law School where he will get his law degree, marry a woman of good background in Selma Blair and claim the family legacy of public office. So there's no time for his homecoming queen Reese although I'm sure he'd arrange something on the side later.She's totally floored by this, but our intrepid girl vows to fight fire with fire. If he can go be a Hah-Vard Law School Graduate so can she. I mean she's got a 4.0 GPA even if it is in fashion design.But beneath her Barbie Doll personality, she actually does have a brain. She aces the law boards and sends a unique video essay that is something different for the admission committee to ponder. She gets to Harvard to be with Davis, who's unfortunately there with Blair.At this point the charm of Reese Witherspoon really takes over and dominates the film. I'm not sure anyone else could have pulled off the part of Elle Woods. With that wonderful combination of charm and guilelessness, Reese Witherspoon has created an endearing character, one she's already done a sequel film with.She's nicely aided by Luke Wilson as an attorney and crony of one of her law professors. Another performance that I liked was that of Holland Taylor as a feminist law professor who's initially put off by Witherspoon, but gradually comes to appreciate her worth. In fact in the end just about everyone in the film comes to appreciate her worth, some to their regret.I don't know about you, but I'd like to see a Legally Blonde 3.

I thought "oh no - another dumb teen movie", but I was pleasantly surprised. The main character is extremely likable, and you can feel sorry for her plight - once you get over her superficiality she appears to have at the beginning.  I am not usually a fan of such movies, but found this one to be acceptable.  (Then again maybe it's because I watched the horrible "All the pretty horses" just before viewing this and anything would have looked good.)

Well, if this movie claims to be in favour of girl power then I really pity girls the whole world over. This films basic message is it's okay to be ditzy, because you may have a brain underneath. And even if you don't, then you'll definately end up with the good looking bloke in the front row.My girlfriend makes me watch quite a few chic flicks, and with the exception of What Women Want (which was truely abhorrent - even she didn't like it!) this is the worst I've ever seen. Avoid. Even chic-flicks (c.f. Shakespeare in Love) can be made with an element of humour, which even this film lacked

In `Legally Blonde,'  which could well be re-titled `Clueless Goes to Harvard'  - the delightful Reese Witherspoon stars as a ditzy, fashion-obsessed airhead who winds up (through plot complications too elaborate to go through) taking that Ivy League law school by storm. Needless to say, there is not a single believable moment in the film, but that is generally the case with most fish-out-of-water scenarios anyway. What `Legally Blonde' does have is a warm spirit, a bubbly demeanor and a breezy charm that reflect to a tee the personality of its main character.Although the film does not exhibit the same level of comic genius we found in `Clueless,' Witherspoon's letter-perfect rendition of the bubblehead stereotype earns the film a great deal of audience goodwill, a factor that helps us to get over some of the movie's flatter moments.  For indeed, throughout the course of this tale, we do hit a number of arid stretches where we feel that we should be laughing an awful lot more than we are.  In fact, `Legally Blonde' occasionally feels more like a concept in search of a movie than a full-fledged work in its own right.  But, just as you are about to give up on it, the filmmakers hit upon a hilarious concept, sight gag or line of dialogue, which help to set the movie back on track.Clearly, Witherspoon is the big selling point of this film.  As an actress, she exudes such an air of intelligence, confidence and compassionate goodwill that she invests even her dumb blonde character with those seemingly paradoxical traits.  `Legally Blonde' isn't always at the top of its form, but Witherspoon wins the case for the film hands down anyway.

Legally Blonde (2001) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a California well to do lady that believes she is about to marry her high school sweet heart. Her sweet heart plans to become a lawyer in hopes of becoming a politician one day and she believes she would be the perfect wife to support his goals and ambitions. He doesn't and breaks up with her because he believes she doesn't take things seriously. She looks to prove him wrong by going to Harvard and getting her own legal degree but will that be enough to change his mind?This movie is directed by Robert Luketic (21) and stars Reese Witherspoon (Walk the Line), Luke Wilson (Bottle Rocket), Jennifer Coolidge (American Pie), Selma Blair (Hellboy), Victor Garber (Titanic), Ali Larter (Final Destination) and Linda Cardellini (Scooby-Doo).The storyline for this picture actually had more depth and better characters than I anticipated. The dialogue, interactions and circumstances are very smart and there's some good messages about not reading a book by its cover and labels. The comedic content is inconsistent but the movie unfolds well and is entertaining. There's a few aspects that were a bit much, but overall this is enjoyable. I would score this movie a solid 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.

A bimbo becoming a top lawyer: only in Hollywood!! That's the premise here and a winsome Reese Witherspoon pulls it off in a charming way, which she would have to do to make this ludicrous story watchable. It's a bit on the feminist side with most men pictured as shallow but there are women pictured the same, too. In an era PC baloney, at least this film pokes fun at everyone, not just select groups.Witherspoon and Luke Wilson both play good, nice people and it's nice to see a Wilson brother NOT playing someone stupid. There are stupid parts in here, but you get that in any comedy. There are also some very clever lines in there, too, but overall it's pretty low-brained material.....just played for fun. It would have been more innocent without a needless off-key or profane remark here and there.

This movie is so great. I can't believe I only recently saw this, and that it took me so long to actually watch it. I think the cast portray their characters very well and overall, it's just a very funny, light-hearted movie, with a lot of emotion.This movie is about Elle Woods. She has it all. She's the president of her sorority, and she has a great boyfriend. That is, until he dumps her. Because she's blonde. Not literally because of the hair color, but because she portrays a dumb blonde girl. So, to get him back and make him see that he was wrong, she decides to become a law student, like her ex- boyfriend. Since he's going to Harvard, she works so hard to also get accepted. Recommended for: Comedy fans, romantic comedy fans, Reese Witherspoon fans, getting- back-at-your ex fans.Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Great.

When my girlfriend finally convinced me to watch this movie, I still had extremely low expectations for it, and I am sad to say that I was still disappointed.This film is a giant hypocrisy. It tries to claim that women are just as powerful and smart as men, which I really don't need convincing of, but this film actually made me question that idea instead of support it. The only statement that it makes is that women have to manipulate and lie to men in order to succeed. Sure, Elle may have gotten into Harvard without doing so, which, of course is possible, but the film makes it seem impossible, especially with the stereotypical Harvard students that she meets and cannot manage to get along with. The worst part is that she works so hard to get into Harvard for all the wrong reasons. In the end, it tells young women that they can succeed in life even if they live inside of a little bubble that disregards all other life forms, even their own pets.I almost ripped my own arms off during the 'bend and snap' scene, in which Elle teaches a beauty salon full of women a move that is sure to catch the attention of a nearby man to get him to talk to you. So, in a film that is 'more than just another Girl Power Film', the main character teaches other females how to get a man's attention by showing off her breasts and butt. How innovative.I live in Southern California, and if I see another dog dressed up and being carried in a purse, I am going to move to Sri Lanka. To anyone who thinks that that is cute, please see South Park episode 812, which features Paris Hilton's dog committing suicide.In all, this film obviously appeals very well to young women and I can maybe even see why many would like it, but it also contributes to the growing number of messages the mass media is sending to young women that make me worried about the future. I suppose, however, if it does encourage young women to aspire to achieve something or inspires them in any way to better themselves, then it is a good thing, just as long as they aren't going to prove something to their ex-boyfriend. Do it for yourself, what's so hard about that?

This movie was listed as one of the most iconic teenager/chick flick movies, and after watching Mean Girls (which I hated and I didn't understand how this movie became an icon), I didn't expect a lot from Legally Blonde. Probably a movie about some shallow, upper class, white teen girl getting into law school because of "connections" and realizing it's actually hard, right?Big wrong.I did cringe at the intro of the movie, because it seems like Elle's motivation to get into law school was simply to get closer to her ex and trying to win him back. But after some realizations, she didn't care about her ex nor some romantic relationship anymore and did her best to keep up with the workload, getting internships, be responsible, proving people that she's not a "basic white girl" who probably graduates from Harvard with "special treatments"I love this movie because they didn't emphasize the importance of having a boyfriend/fiancé/romantic relationship (which is what usually happen to women characters in movies) and instead showed Elle's hard work whilst being underestimated. Elle still has stress and frustration, and she solved it by visiting the salon and make friends along the way. On top of that, the movie created a pretty realistic university scenes, from work stress, bullying, underestimating, to sexual favors--of which Elle handled them gracefully and responsibly.While all of this is happening, Elle also managed to still stay stylish! Which also breaks the stereotype of "fashionable, pretty girls are empty-headed"10/10. A must watch for everyone, especially teenage girls.

My rule when rating movies is to review it all by itself....don't compare it to something else that's completely different from itself. That's the mindset you have to have when watching Legally Blonde, the movie that Reese Witherspoon managed to get a Golden Globe nomination out of. No kidding here. It's really an adorable movie that is appropriate for any age....a very light PG-13.Elle Woods (2006 Oscar Winner Reese Witherspoon) has it all....the perfect boyfriend, Warner, who is handsome, charming, and driven, the perfect life, awesome friends, and a really cute dog. But all of this seems minuscule to the fact that her boyfriend has just dumped her because she is not serious enough, and he wants a girl that is well received by the public when he begins his political career. So, Warner enrolls at Harvard University, leaving Elle (it sounds like the letter 'L') disheveled and sad. Then, 'going where no blonde has gone before' (good use of tagline, right?), Elle decides to work extra hard to enroll at Harvard to win her man back. Well, Elle (funny rhyming there) achieves the requirements in tests and community service, and sends in a very interesting video essay, and gains entrance to the prestigious university. She quickly finds out that not only is her dream man already engaged to another woman (Selma Blair), but Elle is not widely liked around campus. She finds her calling in law, and with the guidance of a friend (the likable and funny Luke Wilson), proves to be a talented prospect in the field.The film is a very watchable film from start to finish, as the movie's opening theme song (Hoku's hit song "Perfect Day") is catchy and likable. Reese Witherspoon's performance is so great and hilarious, yet so true to herself as a person. She shines like the sun in this movie. It can be a little silly at times, not to mention a tad unrealistic and dragging, but Witherspoon's ability overshadows those unfortunate facts. The supporting cast is also good, with Selma Blair and Luke Wilson leading the bunch. Also in there is 'Waiting...' star Alanna Ubach, Matthew Davis, Jennifer Coolidge (NBC's 'Joey'), Ali Larter, Victor Garber as Elle's law professor, and 'Scooby-Doo' star Linda Cardellini.This is the ultimate 'girl power' movie that every person without a Y chromosome will love. Not all men will like it, but I enjoy it whenever it's on television. It's not something I'd buy, but one that is a great rent for the whole family. Also, a word to the wise: watch this one, and this one only, for the sequel is probably the most disappointing sequel in history.7/10 --spy

Elle is the ultimate stereotypical ditsy blonde. She is about to graduate college and has spent the last four years being very happy--and caring less about her future. She's the president of her sorority, homecoming queen and has a great fashion sense. Her plans after graduation are to marry her college sweetheart...period. However, when the boyfriend announces that he's going to Harvard law school and gives her the brushoff, at a spur of the moment she decides she's going to Harvard law as well! While no one would think she had a brain, it turns out Elle is at the top of her class and scores a nearly perfect LSAT--and she, too, is admitted to this prestigious institution. There, however, she's like a fish out of water--and everyone laughs at the audacious and seemingly out to lunch blonde. Will Elle fail or rise to the top? No big surprises here, but it sure is a nice ride.LEGALLY BLONDE is a movie that has no pretense. It knows it's not great art and won't be winning Oscars, yet it also is clever enough to avoid stereotypes or at least defy them. It also knows darn well that the plot is utterly ridiculous but runs with it. However, this isn't so bad, as sometimes you just need to turn off your brain and enjoy a film for what it is--entertainment. I know I am a super-critical person (hence, my 7100+ reviews on IMDb so far), but occasionally it's nice to see a film that isn't an independent film, art film, foreign film or silent--all types of films I usually watch. Sometimes you just need some brain candy! Excellent acting, a nice light directorial touch and good writing make this a standout film--and a lot better than you'd probably imagine.

As a middle-aged bloke, a ditzy, frothy blonde who dresses in designer pink and who has as a pet a Chihuahua, who also dressed in pink would have me running for the hills, screaming and violently pulling out my own fingernails.Unless it's Reese Witherspoon, for whom I do have a soft spot for especially when she's exactly like Miss Elle Woods here. The story itself is really rather far-fetched but even this aspect is sort of sorted by some generous bending of unwritten rules and smart legal jargon.Legally Blonde will always work better for me, when Miss Woods is gaily arranging sorority parties and being just ridiculously OTT about fashion choices and tartly responding when others try and make her look ridiculous. This comic timing is perfectly suited to the bubbly and vibrant Witherspoon and she remains a tonic throughout.The court case that she falls into defending might be essential to the story of how she gets her legal qualifications and to prove all her doubters totally wrong, but for me, this plays second fiddle to the comedy I mention. The romance angle, an essential premise, as at the start, her boyfriend Warner, who she was absolutely sure was going to propose to her, dumps her, essentially because she's a 'dumb' blonde.He's off to Harvard and so, naturally, Elle scrapes through the preliminaries with the skimpiest of appropriate qualifications (majoring in obscure fashion, for example) so that he could no longer hold that reason against her. He, though, is already dating the surly Selma Blair.I've probably seen Legally... three times now. The sequel/s don't command any great affection for me but this original is one that is both a great comedy and has a real feel-good factor too, without resorting to the gross-out and toilet humour that's unfortunately seen as an essential ingredient in today's US comedies.

I didn't go into "Legally Blonde" expecting too much. I rarely go to actual movie theaters to see a film (I usually rent videos/DVDs), but I got an advance on this one, and I was kind of sad it had to be this film I was going to see, but I had been invited along with two other people to see it and I wasn't going to say "no" for no reason. So I went. One of the persons I went with just wanted to see Reese Witherspoon in a Playboy bunny costume, so I figured I was in for another average run-'o-the-mill sex comedy. But I was very surprised with the outcome.So many girl-power comedies these days are made just for the sake of trying to prove a point that women are equals to men (I suppose that's the message behind it--what else was "Now and Then" made for?) and/or support for women. Fortunately, the 2001 hit "Legally Blonde" is not only a pleasant surprise, but an intelligent film, as well. (Sorry, that was my main "gripper" for this review and I had to leave it in.) Reese Witherspoon plays California sorority girl Elle Woods. Unlike other people her age that are worrying about grades in school, Elle only worries about what toilet paper is the softest. But after her boyfriend dumps her and goes off to Harvard Law School, Elle is determined to go to Harvard and get her man back. So after putting together a very shallow video for the chairmen of Harvard, they accept her into the prestige college (because of her innocent sexuality, no doubt, as we see them gaping at Elle in a bathing suit on the video), and she packs her bags and heads off to Harvard with her little dog Bruiser; as the ads say, "Boldly Going Where No Blonde Has Gone.""Legally Blonde" doesn't give up on the plot and completely divulge into dumb blonde/sex jokes. This film not only has a funny--if ridiculous--plot, but the jokes are, surprisingly, NOT crude sexual jokes. This film is not another "Scary Movie" made for teens: It has divinely orchestrated comic timing. Sometimes the plot gets a bit too heavy--the whole teacher-hitting-on-Elle thing is a bit stereotypical for a film like this--but in the long run it seems to break away from the typical girl-power comedy.
Reese Witherspoon tends to play the same characters a lot, but hey, if she can pull them off, good for her. I don't mind if all her characters tend to be the same (to a certain extent) because they tend to be quite funny and cute--who can't laugh at her Elle Woods persona? The film has a very nice co-star cast: Victor Garber ("Titanic," "Sleepless in Seattle"), Luke Wilson ("Blue Streak," "Charlie's Angels"), and Selma Blair ("The Sweetest Thing," A Guy Thing"--pretty much anyTHING).In the end, not only does "Legally Blonde" come off very funny, but also very witty, good-natured and sweet: One of the most pleasant surprises of 2001, indeed.4/5 stars -John Ulmer

Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again.  In fact, let me help you:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out `Legally Blonde,' a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.

Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the `serious' of the `upper crust' elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears. With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any `shallowness' around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.	Make no mistake, this is one funny movie-- in fact, it's downright hilarious at times.  But beyond the laughter it evokes, there's a flip side to the same coin.  Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film, and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain `mold,' or coincide with someone else's `opinions' of the way things should be, will be able to identify with Elle's situation.  And it's something you have to be aware of, because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff, at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless, heartless, unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her. At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding, but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you.  Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion?  So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye; `dumb blonde' jokes get nipped in the bud, and by using a comedy format, the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining, but thoroughly thought-provoking, as well.
	Reese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle; she conveys such a full-of-life spirit that it is easy to empathize with her, and when the hurt comes, you feel it with her.  And through it all, the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation.  On one hand, when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop, it makes for a falling-on-the-floor moment of hilarity, and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin, as well.  And it makes you root for her all the more.  Witherspoon has a perky, vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part, and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person.  When she gets knocked down, you feel for her; and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground. There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie, and it's one of the best performances of her career.	The supporting cast includes Luke Wilson (Emmett), Selma Blair (Vivian), Victor Garber (Professor Callahan), Jennifer Coolidge (Paulette), Holland Taylor (Professor Stromwell), Ali Larter (Brooke Taylor-Windham), Jessica Cauffiel (Margot), Linda Cardellini (Chutney), Alanna Ubach (Serena) and Oz Perkins (Dorky David), with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  An entertaining, accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message, `Legally Blonde' can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes, but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature. Not always, but occasionally, a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface, and this is one of them.  What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh, while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships.  It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

"Legally Blonde" may not be the funniest movie I've ever seen, but it might just be the most cheerful one. Everything about it is just so damn sparkly. If you can watch this movie without cracking a smile, you're somehow even more of a cynical bastard than I am. The story isn't too inspired and you see pretty much every plot element coming from a mile away but who the hell cares, that's just the movie's way of staying in your comfort zone. Of course she's going to choose the right guy in the end, of course she's going to win the case: nobody would want it any other way. Even Jennifer "what the face" Coolidge can't ruin this movie, that's how charming it really is. Prepare to fall in love.

The heroine of this film is Elle Woods, an undergraduate studying fashion design at a Californian university. Elle is rather cruelly dumped by her ruthlessly ambitious upper-class boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, who has just been accepted by Harvard Law School and intends to be a Senator by the time he is 30. Warner considers that Elle is insufficiently serious and intellectual to marry a man like himself; as he puts it "I need a Jackie, not a Marilyn". (What Warner fails to consider is that, with Marilyn Monroe as a potential First Lady, JFK might have been elected by a landslide instead of having to rely on highly contentious results in Illinois and Texas to put him in the White House).Actually, Warner's misgivings about Elle seem to have some foundation in reality, as she gives the impression of being a shallow, superficial airhead, concerned about little except her appearance and her clothes. (Elle appears to be from a wealthy family; I found myself wondering whether her character was modelled on Paris Hilton, especially as, like Paris, she has a pet Chihuahua). Elle, however, is determined to win Warner back and applies to Harvard Law School herself. Surprisingly, she is accepted, largely because she impresses the male admissions tutors by wearing a skimpy bikini while making her admission video. Once at Harvard, Elle discovers that Warner has now got engaged to Vivian, a snobbish upper-class brunette. After a difficult start, however, she finds herself coping surprisingly well with her academic work, wins an internship with a prestigious Boston law firm and even helps to defend Brooke, an old college friend charged with murdering her elderly husband.James Berardinelli said of "Legally Blonde" that it takes a talented performer to make a dumb character likable as opposed to irritating, an opinion from which I would not dissent. Reese Witherspoon is, of course, a very talented performer, as evidenced by her well-deserved Oscar for "Walk the Line". Even she, however, (and here I would dissent from Mr Berardinelli's view) is unable to make Elle a character one can warm to. The script might tell us that beneath Elle's shallow exterior there is a highly intelligent and resourceful individual. Ms Wetherspoon, however, seemed unable to show us this; her demeanour, her ridiculously overdone dress-sense, her constant changes of hairstyle and (worst of all) her irritatingly high-pitched voice only served to reinforce the impression that beneath Elle's shallow exterior was an equally shallow interior.Elle is the sort of character who in the eighties or nineties would have been played by Melanie Griffith- the film, indeed, has certain similarities with Griffith's "Born Yesterday", another film about a seemingly-dumb blonde with hidden depths. Griffith has always struck me as a much less versatile actress than Witherspoon, but in "Born Yesterday" she succeeded where Witherspoon failed, making her character Billie Dawn surprisingly likable.Moreover, for a film which ostensibly has a "don't judge a book by its cover" message, there was a surprising amount of sexual stereotyping going on. According to this film, lesbians are all plain, dowdy and politically radical; gay men are all camp, narcissistic and hysterically over-emotional. They also, apparently, know everything there is to know about fashion designers, a subject about which straight men are woefully ignorant. Indeed, with the exception of the token "good guy" who becomes Elle's new boyfriend, straight men do not come out of this film any better than gays. Apart from the arrogant and self-obsessed Warner, there is a male law professor who turns out to be a creepy sexual predator, an unattractive nerd who cannot get a date without Elle's assistance and a poor-white-trash deadbeat living in (of course) a run-down old trailer. With the exception of Brooke's oddly-named stepdaughter Chutney, all the female characters are portrayed sympathetically. The formidable-seeming female professor turns out to be more decent than her male colleague, and even Vivian, who is initially portrayed as a social and intellectual snob and a prize bitch, goes through a change of heart and becomes Elle's best friend."Legally Blonde" is essentially a one-joke film, the joke being that although Elle might look, dress and behave like a dumb blonde bimbo, the sort of girl who (as Pamela Stephenson said about Kate Bush) needs an intellect like she needs a hole in the head, underneath the surface she has hidden qualities- not only academic intelligence but also kindness and strength of character. The problem with the film is that, unlike its heroine, it has no hidden depths. The dialogue is flat, the humour is forced and the characters are all stereotypes with whom I could not sympathise. Deep down, it's shallow.

Legally Blonde finds Reese Witherspoon in one of her breakthrough roles as sorority queen Elle Woods who is dumped by her preppy boyfriend Matthew Davis. He's moving on to Harvard Law School where he will get his law degree, marry a woman of good background in Selma Blair and claim the family legacy of public office. So there's no time for his homecoming queen Reese although I'm sure he'd arrange something on the side later.She's totally floored by this, but our intrepid girl vows to fight fire with fire. If he can go be a Hah-Vard Law School Graduate so can she. I mean she's got a 4.0 GPA even if it is in fashion design.But beneath her Barbie Doll personality, she actually does have a brain. She aces the law boards and sends a unique video essay that is something different for the admission committee to ponder. She gets to Harvard to be with Davis, who's unfortunately there with Blair.At this point the charm of Reese Witherspoon really takes over and dominates the film. I'm not sure anyone else could have pulled off the part of Elle Woods. With that wonderful combination of charm and guilelessness, Reese Witherspoon has created an endearing character, one she's already done a sequel film with.She's nicely aided by Luke Wilson as an attorney and crony of one of her law professors. Another performance that I liked was that of Holland Taylor as a feminist law professor who's initially put off by Witherspoon, but gradually comes to appreciate her worth. In fact in the end just about everyone in the film comes to appreciate her worth, some to their regret.I don't know about you, but I'd like to see a Legally Blonde 3.

I thought "oh no - another dumb teen movie", but I was pleasantly surprised. The main character is extremely likable, and you can feel sorry for her plight - once you get over her superficiality she appears to have at the beginning.  I am not usually a fan of such movies, but found this one to be acceptable.  (Then again maybe it's because I watched the horrible "All the pretty horses" just before viewing this and anything would have looked good.)

Well, if this movie claims to be in favour of girl power then I really pity girls the whole world over. This films basic message is it's okay to be ditzy, because you may have a brain underneath. And even if you don't, then you'll definately end up with the good looking bloke in the front row.My girlfriend makes me watch quite a few chic flicks, and with the exception of What Women Want (which was truely abhorrent - even she didn't like it!) this is the worst I've ever seen. Avoid. Even chic-flicks (c.f. Shakespeare in Love) can be made with an element of humour, which even this film lacked

In `Legally Blonde,'  which could well be re-titled `Clueless Goes to Harvard'  - the delightful Reese Witherspoon stars as a ditzy, fashion-obsessed airhead who winds up (through plot complications too elaborate to go through) taking that Ivy League law school by storm. Needless to say, there is not a single believable moment in the film, but that is generally the case with most fish-out-of-water scenarios anyway. What `Legally Blonde' does have is a warm spirit, a bubbly demeanor and a breezy charm that reflect to a tee the personality of its main character.Although the film does not exhibit the same level of comic genius we found in `Clueless,' Witherspoon's letter-perfect rendition of the bubblehead stereotype earns the film a great deal of audience goodwill, a factor that helps us to get over some of the movie's flatter moments.  For indeed, throughout the course of this tale, we do hit a number of arid stretches where we feel that we should be laughing an awful lot more than we are.  In fact, `Legally Blonde' occasionally feels more like a concept in search of a movie than a full-fledged work in its own right.  But, just as you are about to give up on it, the filmmakers hit upon a hilarious concept, sight gag or line of dialogue, which help to set the movie back on track.Clearly, Witherspoon is the big selling point of this film.  As an actress, she exudes such an air of intelligence, confidence and compassionate goodwill that she invests even her dumb blonde character with those seemingly paradoxical traits.  `Legally Blonde' isn't always at the top of its form, but Witherspoon wins the case for the film hands down anyway.

Legally Blonde (2001) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a California well to do lady that believes she is about to marry her high school sweet heart. Her sweet heart plans to become a lawyer in hopes of becoming a politician one day and she believes she would be the perfect wife to support his goals and ambitions. He doesn't and breaks up with her because he believes she doesn't take things seriously. She looks to prove him wrong by going to Harvard and getting her own legal degree but will that be enough to change his mind?This movie is directed by Robert Luketic (21) and stars Reese Witherspoon (Walk the Line), Luke Wilson (Bottle Rocket), Jennifer Coolidge (American Pie), Selma Blair (Hellboy), Victor Garber (Titanic), Ali Larter (Final Destination) and Linda Cardellini (Scooby-Doo).The storyline for this picture actually had more depth and better characters than I anticipated. The dialogue, interactions and circumstances are very smart and there's some good messages about not reading a book by its cover and labels. The comedic content is inconsistent but the movie unfolds well and is entertaining. There's a few aspects that were a bit much, but overall this is enjoyable. I would score this movie a solid 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.

A bimbo becoming a top lawyer: only in Hollywood!! That's the premise here and a winsome Reese Witherspoon pulls it off in a charming way, which she would have to do to make this ludicrous story watchable. It's a bit on the feminist side with most men pictured as shallow but there are women pictured the same, too. In an era PC baloney, at least this film pokes fun at everyone, not just select groups.Witherspoon and Luke Wilson both play good, nice people and it's nice to see a Wilson brother NOT playing someone stupid. There are stupid parts in here, but you get that in any comedy. There are also some very clever lines in there, too, but overall it's pretty low-brained material.....just played for fun. It would have been more innocent without a needless off-key or profane remark here and there.

A very sweet and pleasant melodrama with elements of comedy, telling the story of the stunning blonde Elle Woods, who decided to break stereotypes and enroll in Harvard as a lawyer, which she succeeds in. There are many funny and even very funny moments, the music pleases, even the thought of the film promotes the right one - you always need to grow above yourself and not get hung up on one thing, and all this is served through a silly, but sweet and kind girl who you can empathize with. Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson and Selma Blair are just clever here! Box office success and the love of viewers of both sexes is absolutely deserved here! There is no desire to watch the sequel (they probably ruined everything, don't even go to your grandmother).My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!

I am not the biggest fan of chick flicks, especially ones that strongly feature the caricature of a 'ditzy blonde'. However, the side of me which studies government and enjoys academia found this movie unusually intriguing. It is fun watching a person defy all expectations! It's not a perfect movie, but the more intellectual crowd may enjoy it more than they initially expect.

Saying this is a good movie may not sound like much, but after watching all the other summer movies, this is a breath of fresh air. Reese Witherspoon is proving to be one of the best young actors of our time and she makes this movie something fun to see.  Other than "The Sexy Beast", this was one movie that was any good so far this summer.

This is a movie which in many ways is great. A lot of charm, a lot of fun, acting is great, and we have an actual feminist hero promoting female empowerment as it should be promoted. Blue haired twitter whales and left-wing communist feminists should be taking notes.However this is also campy barbie going to the big city with all the cliches we have seen a million times before. And the movie, although a fun watch, is nothing special.This movie can easily be picked apart if you want to do real critique, but the charm and fun of it just make you forgive this movie for all its faults. This is simply an easily digestible fun charming movie with charming characters. Despite me giving this a 6/10, this is well worth a watch if you have nothing else to do.

When my girlfriend finally convinced me to watch this movie, I still had extremely low expectations for it, and I am sad to say that I was still disappointed.This film is a giant hypocrisy. It tries to claim that women are just as powerful and smart as men, which I really don't need convincing of, but this film actually made me question that idea instead of support it. The only statement that it makes is that women have to manipulate and lie to men in order to succeed. Sure, Elle may have gotten into Harvard without doing so, which, of course is possible, but the film makes it seem impossible, especially with the stereotypical Harvard students that she meets and cannot manage to get along with. The worst part is that she works so hard to get into Harvard for all the wrong reasons. In the end, it tells young women that they can succeed in life even if they live inside of a little bubble that disregards all other life forms, even their own pets.I almost ripped my own arms off during the 'bend and snap' scene, in which Elle teaches a beauty salon full of women a move that is sure to catch the attention of a nearby man to get him to talk to you. So, in a film that is 'more than just another Girl Power Film', the main character teaches other females how to get a man's attention by showing off her breasts and butt. How innovative.I live in Southern California, and if I see another dog dressed up and being carried in a purse, I am going to move to Sri Lanka. To anyone who thinks that that is cute, please see South Park episode 812, which features Paris Hilton's dog committing suicide.In all, this film obviously appeals very well to young women and I can maybe even see why many would like it, but it also contributes to the growing number of messages the mass media is sending to young women that make me worried about the future. I suppose, however, if it does encourage young women to aspire to achieve something or inspires them in any way to better themselves, then it is a good thing, just as long as they aren't going to prove something to their ex-boyfriend. Do it for yourself, what's so hard about that?

This movie was listed as one of the most iconic teenager/chick flick movies, and after watching Mean Girls (which I hated and I didn't understand how this movie became an icon), I didn't expect a lot from Legally Blonde. Probably a movie about some shallow, upper class, white teen girl getting into law school because of "connections" and realizing it's actually hard, right?Big wrong.I did cringe at the intro of the movie, because it seems like Elle's motivation to get into law school was simply to get closer to her ex and trying to win him back. But after some realizations, she didn't care about her ex nor some romantic relationship anymore and did her best to keep up with the workload, getting internships, be responsible, proving people that she's not a "basic white girl" who probably graduates from Harvard with "special treatments"I love this movie because they didn't emphasize the importance of having a boyfriend/fiancé/romantic relationship (which is what usually happen to women characters in movies) and instead showed Elle's hard work whilst being underestimated. Elle still has stress and frustration, and she solved it by visiting the salon and make friends along the way. On top of that, the movie created a pretty realistic university scenes, from work stress, bullying, underestimating, to sexual favors--of which Elle handled them gracefully and responsibly.While all of this is happening, Elle also managed to still stay stylish! Which also breaks the stereotype of "fashionable, pretty girls are empty-headed"10/10. A must watch for everyone, especially teenage girls.

This movie is so great. I can't believe I only recently saw this, and that it took me so long to actually watch it. I think the cast portray their characters very well and overall, it's just a very funny, light-hearted movie, with a lot of emotion.This movie is about Elle Woods. She has it all. She's the president of her sorority, and she has a great boyfriend. That is, until he dumps her. Because she's blonde. Not literally because of the hair color, but because she portrays a dumb blonde girl. So, to get him back and make him see that he was wrong, she decides to become a law student, like her ex- boyfriend. Since he's going to Harvard, she works so hard to also get accepted. Recommended for: Comedy fans, romantic comedy fans, Reese Witherspoon fans, getting- back-at-your ex fans.Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Great.

If you are searching for a lightweight comedy with some clever acting (especially Reese Witherspoon) then I can recommend this movie. If you are searching for a film with any insight about overcoming stereotypes (even the usual banal Hollywood offering), then look elsewhere. Although the plot was predictable, there were some funny moments that I enjoyed. Reese Witherspoon is a talented actress (both comedic and dramatic) and I look forward to seeing her in future roles. But, beyond the level of a predictable comedy, no one should look for any depth in this movie. SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW. For those of you (and apparently there are a few) who feel a desire to find a message in this movie, I need point out only one fundamentally flawed character (amongst many possible choices) for whom we are apparently supposed to feel compassion (because she is being stereotyped), but who is in fact detestable -- Brooke Taylor-Windham (played by Ali Larter). A woman who marries an older man (apparently because she likes the sex) but feels no compassion for the man's daughter (who is seemingly distraught about having a step-mother of about the same age as she). A woman who deceives her clients in order to make money. A woman who demeans her employees (she makes the pool man wear a thong because she likes the way he looks when he bends over). And yet we are supposed to cheer when she fires her lawyer (played by Victor Garber) because he is a creep (which he is). Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. The movie itself contains so many stereotypes (e.g., Dorky Dave, who can't get a date without Elle's noble intervention, while she herself only dates good-looking guys) that there is no reason to look beyond the comedic element for something deeper (it doesn't exist). Enjoy it for what it is, nothing more.
