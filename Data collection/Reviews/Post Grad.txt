Ryden Malby is a young woman who planned most of her academic life: since school to her dream job. She always had good grades in school and in College, and now that she is graduated, she is certain that she will get a job as assistant editor in the publishing house Happerman & Browning, in L.A. But sadly for her,Jessica Bard, her arrogant classmate and biggest rival, gets the position she dreamed of. And Ryden is forced to return home to live with her parents again, where she will need to deal with lots of frustrations and many refuses of the jobs she is applying to.I decided to watch this movie because at first, I liked the plot (the- graduating- girl -who- stays -unemployed- for- a -long -time is much more realistic then that thing in the movies that shows that everybody who graduates has an incredible job who pays you a lot of money!). But as I started watching it, I saw that the movie doesn't have anything special: it doesn't work as a comedy, since it's not funny, and doesn't work as a drama or real life story. We see Ryden struggle a lot to finally get a good job, and when she finally gets it, she gave up in order to run away after her best friend? Seriously, I found that so stupid and unreal. I know this is a movie and we shouldn't worry too much about it, but I don't think the final message of it matches with the character's dreams or realizations. Sorry, doesn't work for me.The only thing I really liked in this movie was to see Rodrigo Santoro, my hot compatriot, in a movie with more lines and more acting then the previous ones he participated.

So does Alexis Bledel plan to build a movie career out of tracing the hypothetical life trajectory of the character she created on "Gilmore Girls?" This is the second movie I've seen this year in which Bledel basically plays Rory Gilmore at the stage of her life she would generally be in if "Gilmore Girls" was still on the air. In this movie, she's a perky go-getter who's aghast when she finds out that the world will not necessarily adapt itself to her designs and whims, until...guess what....it does and she gets everything she wanted anyway.This movie is harmless enough, but the only thing that makes it more worth your time than something from the straight-to-DVD bargain bin in the supermarket (or maybe this WAS one of those films) is a crazy and admittedly pretty funny performance from Michael Keaton as Bledel's doofus father.Grade: B-

Ryden (Alexis Bledel) is a new college graduate. She plans to work at a huge firm, but doesn't get the job. Now she is forced to move into her old house with her eccentric family. She has her wacky mom, Carmella (Jane Lynch), her caring dad, Walter (Michael Keaton), her best friend, Adam (Zach Gilford), and her brother, Hunter (Bobby Coleman). She has to balance moving back into the nest while trying to find a decent job. Bledel has a certain charm, a certain spark in her, but she is stuck with a character you simply can't like. She doesn't like Adam dating anyone, but she refuses to date Adam. All she has to do is find a decent job, but ends up complaining when she takes a horrible job. The whole cast, including Lynch, Keaton, Coleman, and Gilford are all so good, and I've seen them be good in other stuff. They all are pretty good here, but also have characters you are forced to not like. It's just a mess of a film with a certain charm, a certain spark of light to it. Unfortunately, you can't connect with these characters, and you do not care what happens to any of these characters. This makes this a movie that's not terrible, but you can do better, so don't kick yourself if you never see this movie.

Now i'm not going to say this film was a classic or something you will want to watch over and over. What I can say about this film is that it was very surprising and offbeat despite the way the film was promoted.Bandslam promoting take 2. Like the film Bandslam headlined by Disney stars, this film suffers from a lack of realistic advertising. Basically the film you think your going to see, you aren't. Bandslam was not a Disney film so much as a quirky teen comedy about diversity and the unification of those otherwise lone wolves for a greater cause.Post Grad is essentially a film about a girl, Alexis Bledel, whose ideas of life post grad come crashing down around her when she realizes it isn't as she assumed it would be. Finding a job is much tougher then expected, and it doesn't help that she is unqualified, but over confident.The film delves a little deeper with a lot of little subplots ranging from cute to over the top and strange, grandmother shopping for her own coffin.The film was pretty offbeat and not as mainstream slapstick as it comes off in the trailers. It is a semi realistic film and Alexis does the best I have seen her do since Season one of Gilmore Girls. While she isn't Meryl Streep she plays the role of Ryden with great presence.I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think that if it had better promoting and was targeted also at indie film fans, this film had the potential to be a hit.Jane Lynch is also really great in the film, serving her character dutifully. Overall I was surprised and enjoyed the film, despite the negative reviews it has received.This isn't a plant review FYI, check my posting history if you will, I saw the film, and enjoyed it. I would give it a chance. It's a fun light film, perfect to take your mind off the current state of economy and Swine Flu worries floating about.A fun, fun film. Check it out!

Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) has planned her academic life since she was in high-school to get a college scholarship; now she has just graduated in English and in her master plan she expects to get a job as assistant editor in the publishing house Happerman & Browning, in Los Angeles. Her platonic best friend is Adam Davis (Zach Gilford) that has a crush on her and is frequently close to her. However, her arrogant classmate Jessica Bard (Catherine Reitman) gets the position and Ryden is forced to return home in the suburb to live with her optimistic father Walter (Michael Keaton) that wants to do everything by himself; her careful mother Carmella (Jane Lynch) that administrates the the short resources of her family; her eccentric grandmother Maureen (Carol Burnett); and her weird little brother Hunter (Bobby Coleman) that wishes to race in a boxcar derby. Ryden unsuccessfully seeks a job position and feels frustrated but is emotionally supported by Adam. When Walter accidentally runs over the cat of his next-door neighbor David Santiago (Rodrigo Santoro) with Ryden's car, they visit him to give their sympathies. Ryden feels attracted by the handsome Brazilian and has a brief affair with him, forgetting Adam that decides to move to New York to study in the law school of Columbia. Meanwhile Ryden is invited to join Happerman & Browning and she discovers that feelings cannot be planned. "Post Grad" is one of those movies that professional movie critics hate and obviously will never be awarded or nominated or even participate in festivals. The low IMDb User Rating (5.1/10 with 2,128 votes) is an evidence of the foregoing statement. However, this romantic comedy is an enjoyable family entertainment recommended for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. The delightful film is funny and very pleasant, with a good message. Alexis Bledel, from "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants", is one of the most beautiful actresses of the younger generation and the role of Ryden Malby seems to be tailored for her. The Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro and the unknown Zach Gilford have good participation as romantic pairs of Alexis Bledel. The veterans Michael Keaton, Jane Lynch and Carol Burnett have an effective participation composing a very weird suburban family. The shameful DVD released in Brazil by Fox do Brasil does not have subtitles in Portuguese. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Recém Formada – E Agora?" ("Just Graduated – And Now?")

In a word: awkward.Why on earth did I watch this film? I like Zach Gilford, and his performance was pretty good for the most part. But the movie itself? I can't really say anything good about it. Chunks of action/dialogue seemed to be missing, and some of the performances felt a little off.The only thing I commend is, bizarrely, the DVD extras. They have some awesome career advice from experts like Marcus Buckingham, and other fun bits that felt like a breath of fresh air (especially to those who recently graduated) So, skip the film, but watch for the special features. It'll save you time, and you might learn a thing or two.6/10

I so wanted to like this film but I felt like I was watching two different movies, or I should say two different types of comedy. You have Alexis Bledel on one hand, who in my opinion, is better suited to a more sophisticated comedy (I mean, just watch any episode of Gilmore Girls and see how great she is) then you have Michael Keaton, Jane Lynch and Carol Burnett who are far more slapstick in their approach. Michael Keaton's acting and facial expressions tell me he still wishes he were doing Mr. Mom, not in itself a bad film, just wrong for this one. The only thing I liked was the fact that the script did not take the easy way out and she ended up with the right man. I watched this for Alexis, and will someone please write her a sophisticated screwball comedy so she can show what she can do?

When the movie ends, you can summarize it in only one sentence. During the whole movie, we (two 18 year old girls) kept predicting what would happen next and every time we were right. It feels like they almost got it right every scene, but somehow only certain scenes lift up the quality of the movie. Most of the time those are the scenes with only Alexis Bledel and Zach Gilford. The parents of Alexis' character were very annoying -except for Jane Lynch- and we couldn't figure out what was the function of the son and the grandmother. If they were there to be funny, it didn't work. None of the funny stuff worked actually, except for a certain incident with an animal -people who've seen it will know-. There were two things that kept our attention, mind you we're teenage girls, was Alexis' gorgeous hair and her clothes. Choice of wardrobe was fabulous. in the end, this movie has many potential, they wanted it to be great, funny and dramatic but it just didn't work out that way. The storyline is too thin and the ending is very sudden, which is also very annoying. We've been watching the main character struggle the entire movie and then it suddenly all ends. Only watch it when there's nothing better on.

You want to see a film about a woman who graduates from college, immediately has her hopes absolutely ridiculously high up, thinking that she will be employed at her dream job right away and gets to move into an extremely fancy apartment? Who then, shockingly, has to face the cold hard facts of life, not getting a job even after many, many interviews, and is forced to move back to live with her parents? Who has a male friend that has always been there for her and that happens to also have been in love with her for a while now and has made that very clear, being a little bitter that she never loved him back? Who then meets a hot guy living next door, hooks up with him, and gets so caught up in him that she forgets a meeting with the boy who loves her, which makes the boy angry and blame her for not falling in love with him even though he has been waiting and waiting? Who then feels all guilty about it and has to watch the angry boy move away to New York, while she herself ends up getting her dream job after all and having everything getting sorted out in her life, but still feeling that something's wrong? Who then quits her dream job and moves to New York because, apparently, she IS in love with the angry boy after all? Who arrives at the angry boy's dorm, reporting all her deepest feelings to him in the doorway, and finally notices that there is another woman in the room, which, obviously, makes her turn away and run outside, bemused? Who then is stopped by the angry boy, who explains that the woman was his resident adviser? Who then kisses the angry boy and tells him that she loves him, and lives with him happily ever after?In case this is precisely what you're looking for, by all means - watch this film. Should be perfectly suitable for your needs.

Coming into this one, I knew nothing of the movie and nothing of the lead actors (I've never watched Gossip Girl), although I've always liked Michael Keaton and, of course, Carol Burnett. It's a pleasant, effective coming of age-type story.It helps that I didn't know Alexis Bledel before seeing this film. With no 'baggage' about other characters she might have played, I felt she was excellent in the role, giving a nicely understated performance, with a delicate beauty that gives her a definite presence on the screen. She brought a nice mix of perky gawkiness to the character, making the role quite believable.Keaton was fun to watch, and Burnett has always been one of my favorites, and provided most of the laugh out loud moments (there were at least a couple of those). Zach Gilford (I've never watched Friday Night Lights either) mumbles a bit too much, and tends to get lost next to Bledel. But then, that's part of the character too.While I cringed at some of the plot twists (including the ending), which seemed a bit too willful, the pacing of the editing made the film flow quite nicely, allowing the sweetness of the coming-of-age story to come through, without attempting to become slapstick about it. The supporting cast go a long way in helping to build the film's "universe." And that is the question I ask about this type of movie: Will I enjoy entering the film's universe for the duration? The answer for Post Grad: Yes, I did.

Alexis Bledel shone in the seven years of Gilmore Girls (well, six, I don't think anyone came out of the seventh season strongly) so it was no surprise that people thought she was strong enough a talent to carry this movie.And to be fair, she is by far the best thing about this film. She's funny, she makes her character's story about life post uni, as well as dealing with a friend that wants to be more, relatable and true.Unfortunately when the focus moves away from this and onto to her family life the film falls apart. Every 'quirky' character trait the writers give the family is unfunny, and normally very reliable actors begin to chew scenery. Michael Keaton in particular is embarrassing in this film.Overall this is a film that's only good in places for this reason. It's a shame because Bledel works well with the limited material and needs more opportunities to show this obvious talent on the big screen.

Many of us can relate to the Ryden character in 'Post Grad'. Having been in a similar situation and knowing that Alexis Bledel would lead the movie, I decided to watch it. The film starts off well with an overenthusiastic, overconfident and naive Ryden going to her interview and then being 'bumped off' by an arch rival. The comedy works very well (except for the Michael Keaton belt lock sequence which appears like forced humour) but otherwise 'Post Grad' moves at a very slow pace. I think Vicky could have added more comedy and gone more in depth with Ryden's struggle. Alexis Bledel is very good as Ryden Malby and I hope she gets more fine roles in great movies in the future. Michael Keaton is a little over the top but it was good to see him after a long time. Jane Lynch is poorly underused. Carol Burnett is hilarious. It was only much later that I found out that Adam wasn't played by Gabriel Mann but by an actor named Zach Gilford (who is a splitting image). Overall, it's not too bad for a one time watch but it could have been way more fun.

One would expect that an actress such as Alexis Blendel would have something known as experience by now. Tragically that is not the case. Despite her sparkling eyes there is simply nothing from her side that could sustain this comedy. The only thing about her is her cuteness but that doesn't count as talent. Jane Lynch, Carol Burnett and Michael Keaton make this movie bearable. Sadly they don't get enough screen time in this flick. Other actors seem underpaid and thus unmotivated. Rodrigo Santoro plays some Hollywood Latino douche who, out of nowhere, comes up with a quote that turns the whole movie around. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen it all. Watch it if you're really bored or if you got a crush on Alexis Blendel - avoid if not. You have been warned.

If you're a fan of TV talkfest Gilmore Girls, Post Grad is probably as close as you're ever going to get to a GG movie. Lorelai is nowhere to be found, but Alexis Bledel is basically playing Rory and she's surrounded by a clutch of oddballs right out of Stars Hollow. If you've never seen Gilmore Girls, you'll only be able to tolerate this mildly amusing and terminally predictable film until it wears out its welcome, which it does in a very big way.Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) is a young and ambitious college graduate who's on the verge of getting the job she's dreamed of her whole life. But when that job goes to her lifelong scholastic rival, Ryden has to move back in with her parents and deal with her father (Michael Keaton), who's like a combination of Ralph Kramden and Norton from The Honeymooners. When not preoccupied by her dad or her futile job search, Ryden also falls in like with the handsome foreigner next door (Rodrigo Santoro) and remains an indifferent bitch to her best friend (Zach Gilford), who is totally in love with her while she treats him like a gay foot stool. Some funny things happen, many of which don't involve Ryden, and then screenwriter Kelly Fremon pulls a major plot point and two big emotional moments completely out of her ass and gives Ryden a weirdly anti-feminist happy ending that the character has done nothing to deserve.Bledel is a pleasant and attractive presence on screen, though her eyes are so blue that there a moments when she resembles one of the Na'vi from Avatar. Michael Keaton and Carol Burnett as Ryden's live-in grandma use their comedy chops to breathe a lot of life into shallowly drawn roles. And at only 88 minutes long, Post Grad moves along at a good enough clip to hold your interest for a surprisingly long time, given the extraordinarily ordinary story its telling. And unless you've been dying to see Rory Gilmore say the S-word, that's about all the positives to be found in this production.The negatives of Post Grad aren't that bad, but there are just so bleepin' many of them. To start with, Ryden is not all that sympathetic a girl. She starts out kind of charmingly arrogant and presumptuous, then falls back into just plain arrogant and self-pitying. When that's compounded by the exploitative nature of her relationship with Zach Gilford's character, where she knows he loves her but she's content to keep him around as a platonic sidekick, you're left with the extremely likable Bledel playing someone you wouldn't miss if she got hit by a truck.Then there's the consistently poor writing. There's a subplot involving Ryden's dad and her little brother that, and I'm not joking, consists of not much more than 5 or 6 lines of dialog and maybe a minute or two of screen time but leads up to one of those big emotional moments Fremon pulled out of her ass. I didn't even realize it was an actual subplot until it got to that out-of-left-field climax. Jane Lynch as Ryden's mom is also given nothing to work with. Her character couldn't be more unformed if she were warm Jello and couldn't be more generic if she had a bar code on her forehead. And then there's a whole scene where Ryden literally does nothing but stand around while the story suddenly becomes all about the career frustrations of the foreigner next door.By the time the ending came around and Ryden gave up all of the dreams she ever had for her life to fly across the country and be a girlfriend to Zach Gilford's character, after showing as much sexual or romantic interest in him as Barbara Streisand would have for Rush Limbaugh, I only wanted this movie to go away. Which is unfortunate because Post Grad started out rather engaging, but the plot is so badly conceived and structured that I felt like my intelligence was being deliberately insulted.Alexis Bledel could be the star of a really smart and funny film about a young woman trying to make her way in the world. This ain't it.

The storyline is mainly about the sobering process of fresh College graduates, who face "the real life" for the first time.The lead female character finds out that sheer enthusiasm and confidence alone might not suffice in the attempt to secure a future one aspires to. The lead male character learns that a combination of avoiding difficult decisions and living in denial is hardly the wisest approach to leading one's life. Granted, those are hardly ground-breaking insights, but it may still be fun to watch the process of coming to terms with the reality that those insights refer to.Most of the other characters are there for the comic element.Finally, the acting is passable considering the limitations of the script and the light-hearted spirit of the movie.

In a year of really bad comic movies ("Year One," "Observe & Report," "Funny People," "I Love You, Beth Cooper," among others), this latest effort from director Vicky Jenson (her first live-action feature after helming a series of animated films, including "Shark Tale" and "Shrek") makes a solid case for falling below all of them.A VERY solid case.And that's too bad, considering some fairly talented actors take part (including Michael Keaton, Carol Burnett, Jane Lynch, J. K. Simmons, etc.) in this trip to the principal's office that makes "Land of the Lost" seem like "A Night At The Opera." This picture is a cross between "Legally Blonde" and "Running With Scissors," and made me want to give everyone involved a month of detention.Kindergarten-level plot has Ryden Malby (the beautiful but talentless Alexis Blendel, "Sin City") graduating college with high grades and higher expectations. After failing to secure the high-powered publishing position she had been anticipating, she must now return to her parents' home and deal with her Hollyweird family, including wacky dad (Keaton), down-to-earth mom (Lynch), cheap and cranky grandma (Burnett) and bizarre little moppet, Hunter (Bobby Coleman, "Martian Child").Meanwhile, Ryden's best friend from college, Adam (Zach Gilford, TV series "Grey's Anatomy" and "Friday Night Lights"), who fancies himself a singer - he isn't - is torn between his musical career or going to Columbia Law School (don't give up your day job, man). The gangly oaf has always loved Ryden, but never tells her, even when a Brazilian romeo, Rodrigo (David Santiago, "Che," TV series "Lost") swoops in.Even more annoying subplots include running over a cat, dad's efforts to sell stolen belt buckles, grandma goes shopping for coffins, Rodrigo directing an infomercial starring "SNL's" Fred Armisen (dressed as a giant avocado) and little Hunter's desire to have the coolest soap box racer of all-time.All the while, poor Ryden continues to feel sorry for herself and dream that she is more qualified than she actually is. Then, when she might just get the job of her dreams, she's willing to throw it all away on a whim. None of the actors here - good or bad - can do ANTHING with this disjointed, stilted, clichéd and totally humorless script (by Kelly Fremon, "Streak"), told in a series of poorly conceived vignettes."Post Grad" definitely does not make the grade here, and anyone who pays good money to see this bad report card should be expelled from the theater immediately.

Vicky Jenson's 'Post Grad' is a surprise from the year gone by, 2009. A film that entertains in those 87-minutes, leaving it's viewer happy, most importantly not making you regret the time you devoted in this flick.'Post Grad' was a critical & commercial bomb, and that's unfortunate. Agreed, this isn't an amazing film in any aspect, but a film, as mentioned, that entertains. The film didn't get it's due, hopefully it should do profitable business in the video-DVD circuit.The direction is decent, the writing is passable, the performances by Alexis Bledel, Michael Keaton, Carol Burnett stand out.All said & done, watch 'Post Grad', it's worth a watch.

The film has a reasonable premise with a girl graduating from college and looking to enter the job market in the writing field. It soon gets bogged down into other stories, some of which are inane.Michael Keaton plays the free spirited father who gets into trouble for selling items, not knowing that the latter were stolen. We never find out what happened there.Carol Burnett's part is essentially wasted as Keaton's mother, who hides her money all over the place. She tries to display her usual humor, but the writing here holds back her potential to create more in her role.The story comes down to commitment and following your ambitions.

In a word, Post Grad is....pleasant. I say this because I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, and how it made me feel throughout. Alexis Blydel plays Ryden Malby, a recent college grad who has met little resistance in achieving her goals in life until she suffers a bit of a setback. This rejection sets the tone for the movie by putting Ryden into situation after situation where she quickly realizes that life doesn't always go your way. After moving back home with her family, (The hilarious trio of Michael Keaton, Carol Burnette, and Jane Lynch. More about them in a bit.) Ryde sets out to make her way in the world and find herself along the way. During her journey, Ryden learns about love, friendship, and the overlying theme of the film; family. Post Grad is very formulaic and you will swear that you've seen this movie a hundred times before. You realize that while familiar, Post Grad has that special something that makes the 88 minute run time seem to fly by. The best part of this film is Ryden's family that I mentioned earlier. Keaton, Burnette, and Lynch are all cast in roles that aren't exactly in their comfort zones, but this trio puts a group performance together that is funny and heartfelt. I found myself longing for their next scene together. Post Grad is a charming and funny movie that appeals to a wide audience. It's lack of originality is quickly forgiven by it's strong cast and feel good message. Post Grad earns a C+ in my grade book.

It's entertaining at first to watch what life is like after school. Just because you graduate from college doesn't mean you'll land a dream job, or any job at that, right away. So the main character finds the difficulties in life after college, OK I buy that. At the end she loses her boyfriend, but gets her dream job. That could happen I guess. After it's all said and done she quits her job to follow her boyfriend. At the age of 22, to throw your career/job away for a relationship is a horrible idea. If you're not happy by yourself what makes you think you'll end up being happy with someone else. Especially when you were together you weren't happy to begin with. For all the young seeking professionals out there, establish your life first! So she ran to New York to be with her boyfriend and quit her job. Doesn't she remember how hard it was to get the job in the first place?

Ryden Malby is a young woman who planned most of her academic life: since school to her dream job. She always had good grades in school and in College, and now that she is graduated, she is certain that she will get a job as assistant editor in the publishing house Happerman & Browning, in L.A. But sadly for her,Jessica Bard, her arrogant classmate and biggest rival, gets the position she dreamed of. And Ryden is forced to return home to live with her parents again, where she will need to deal with lots of frustrations and many refuses of the jobs she is applying to.I decided to watch this movie because at first, I liked the plot (the- graduating- girl -who- stays -unemployed- for- a -long -time is much more realistic then that thing in the movies that shows that everybody who graduates has an incredible job who pays you a lot of money!). But as I started watching it, I saw that the movie doesn't have anything special: it doesn't work as a comedy, since it's not funny, and doesn't work as a drama or real life story. We see Ryden struggle a lot to finally get a good job, and when she finally gets it, she gave up in order to run away after her best friend? Seriously, I found that so stupid and unreal. I know this is a movie and we shouldn't worry too much about it, but I don't think the final message of it matches with the character's dreams or realizations. Sorry, doesn't work for me.The only thing I really liked in this movie was to see Rodrigo Santoro, my hot compatriot, in a movie with more lines and more acting then the previous ones he participated.

So does Alexis Bledel plan to build a movie career out of tracing the hypothetical life trajectory of the character she created on "Gilmore Girls?" This is the second movie I've seen this year in which Bledel basically plays Rory Gilmore at the stage of her life she would generally be in if "Gilmore Girls" was still on the air.

Ryden (Alexis Bledel) is a new college graduate. She plans to work at a huge firm, but doesn't get the job. Now she is forced to move into her old house with her eccentric family. She has her wacky mom, Carmella (Jane Lynch), her caring dad, Walter (Michael Keaton), her best friend, Adam (Zach Gilford), and her brother, Hunter (Bobby Coleman). She has to balance moving back into the nest while trying to find a decent job. Bledel has a certain charm, a certain spark in her, but she is stuck with a character you simply can't like. She doesn't like Adam dating anyone, but she refuses to date Adam. All she has to do is find a decent job, but ends up complaining when she takes a horrible job. The whole cast, including Lynch, Keaton, Coleman, and Gilford are all so good, and I've seen them be good in other stuff. They all are pretty good here, but also have characters you are forced to not like. It's just a mess of a film with a certain charm, a certain spark of light to it. Unfortunately, you can't connect with these characters, and you do not care what happens to any of these characters. This makes this a movie that's not terrible, but you can do better, so don't kick yourself if you never see this movie.

This is a film about the struggles of idealistic college graduates coming face-to-face with the realities of the professional world. The protagonist, Ryden, applies to her dream job fresh out of school; she doesn't get it at first, but after a little while, the folks at the company call her up and tell her that the job's hers if she wants it.So, the message of this movie could be: if you're a 22-year-old who just graduated college with no professional experience, and you apply for a high-paying professional job, you'll totally get it. You just might have to wait a month or so.Hmm.Really, this movie had a chance to address something real and relatable–instead it becomes just another cornball wish-fulfillment fantasy. Too bad.

Now i'm not going to say this film was a classic or something you will want to watch over and over.

Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) has planned her academic life since she was in high-school to get a college scholarship; now she has just graduated in English and in her master plan she expects to get a job as assistant editor in the publishing house Happerman & Browning, in Los Angeles.

"Post Grad" is one of those movies that professional movie critics hate and obviously will never be awarded or nominated or even participate in festivals. The low IMDb User Rating (5.1/10 with 2,128 votes) is an evidence of the foregoing statement. However, this romantic comedy is an enjoyable family entertainment recommended for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. The delightful film is funny and very pleasant, with a good message. Alexis Bledel, from "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants", is one of the most beautiful actresses of the younger generation and the role of Ryden Malby seems to be tailored for her. The Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro and the unknown Zach Gilford have good participation as romantic pairs of Alexis Bledel. The veterans Michael Keaton, Jane Lynch and Carol Burnett have an effective participation composing a very weird suburban family. The shameful DVD released in Brazil by Fox do Brasil does not have subtitles in Portuguese. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Recém Formada – E Agora?" ("Just Graduated – And Now?")

In a word: awkward.Why on earth did I watch this film? I like Zach Gilford, and his performance was pretty good for the most part. But the movie itself? I can't really say anything good about it. Chunks of action/dialogue seemed to be missing, and some of the performances felt a little off.The only thing I commend is, bizarrely, the DVD extras. They have some awesome career advice from experts like Marcus Buckingham, and other fun bits that felt like a breath of fresh air (especially to those who recently graduated) So, skip the film, but watch for the special features. It'll save you time, and you might learn a thing or two.6/10

I so wanted to like this film but I felt like I was watching two different movies, or I should say two different types of comedy. You have Alexis Bledel on one hand, who in my opinion, is better suited to a more sophisticated comedy (I mean, just watch any episode of Gilmore Girls and see how great she is) then you have Michael Keaton, Jane Lynch and Carol Burnett who are far more slapstick in their approach. Michael Keaton's acting and facial expressions tell me he still wishes he were doing Mr. Mom, not in itself a bad film, just wrong for this one. The only thing I liked was the fact that the script did not take the easy way out and she ended up with the right man. I watched this for Alexis, and will someone please write her a sophisticated screwball comedy so she can show what she can do?

Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) is a straight A student, but her life post graduation hasn't been going well. She loses her dream job, her car is crushed in a hit-and-run, and she's forced to return to her crazy family home. Her best friend Adam Davis (Zach Gilford) has a crush on her. Her nemesis Jessica Bard (Catherine Reitman) gets the dream job. Her father (Michael Keaton) and her mother (Jane Lynch) just want to help. The next door neighbor is a hot hunky douche (Rodrigo Santoro) who Ryden is immediately smitten with. Her eccentric grandmother Maureen(Carol Burnett), and her weird little brother Hunter (Bobby Coleman) also live in the house.Alexis Bledel is a cute girl, but she comes off as self-obsessed. She has to be careful with that. It can be very unlikeable and whiny. The movie had the potential as a good rom-com. But it concentrates too much on Ryden getting a job rather than getting the boy. And Adam is missing for most of the movie anyways. There are some great comedic skills being wasted in this film. Michael Keaton is OK, but Jane Lynch is downright boring. Carol Burnett tries for flashy brash grandma stuff. At least she got a couple of smiles but no laughs. Demetri Martin does a cute bit.

When the movie ends, you can summarize it in only one sentence. During the whole movie, we (two 18 year old girls) kept predicting what would happen next and every time we were right. It feels like they almost got it right every scene, but somehow only certain scenes lift up the quality of the movie. Most of the time those are the scenes with only Alexis Bledel and Zach Gilford. The parents of Alexis' character were very annoying -except for Jane Lynch- and we couldn't figure out what was the function of the son and the grandmother. If they were there to be funny, it didn't work. None of the funny stuff worked actually, except for a certain incident with an animal -people who've seen it will know-. There were two things that kept our attention, mind you we're teenage girls, was Alexis' gorgeous hair and her clothes. Choice of wardrobe was fabulous. in the end, this movie has many potential, they wanted it to be great, funny and dramatic but it just didn't work out that way. The storyline is too thin and the ending is very sudden, which is also very annoying. We've been watching the main character struggle the entire movie and then it suddenly all ends. Only watch it when there's nothing better on.

You want to see a film about a woman who graduates from college, immediately has her hopes absolutely ridiculously high up, thinking that she will be employed at her dream job right away and gets to move into an extremely fancy apartment? Who then, shockingly, has to face the cold hard facts of life, not getting a job even after many, many interviews, and is forced to move back to live with her parents? Who has a male friend that has always been there for her and that happens to also have been in love with her for a while now and has made that very clear, being a little bitter that she never loved him back? Who then meets a hot guy living next door, hooks up with him, and gets so caught up in him that she forgets a meeting with the boy who loves her, which makes the boy angry and blame her for not falling in love with him even though he has been waiting and waiting? Who then feels all guilty about it and has to watch the angry boy move away to New York, while she herself ends up getting her dream job after all and having everything getting sorted out in her life, but still feeling that something's wrong? Who then quits her dream job and moves to New York because, apparently, she IS in love with the angry boy after all? Who arrives at the angry boy's dorm, reporting all her deepest feelings to him in the doorway, and finally notices that there is another woman in the room, which, obviously, makes her turn away and run outside, bemused? Who then is stopped by the angry boy, who explains that the woman was his resident adviser? Who then kisses the angry boy and tells him that she loves him, and lives with him happily ever after?In case this is precisely what you're looking for, by all means - watch this film. Should be perfectly suitable for your needs.

Post Grad is obviously not the greatest movie out there. It's not going to win any awards, or be loved by the critics. However, it is still a cute movie that allows you to escape for an hour and forty minutes. It has some really funny scenes, and has moral lessons to teach. It's not being received very well and I understand why. It's just a light, fluffy, little movie more suitable for the younger ages. I admit, it could have been better but I wasn't expecting much from the beginning. It was simply a fun little comedy, and one that I'm sure many people can relate to. I didn't find Alexis Bledel annoying. She gave the role all it needed. Her love interest Zach Gilford, was cute and did a decent job. Michael Keaton was the funniest character hands down, and the rest of Bledel's family offered much of the comedy in the film. In all, it's an enjoyable film. I would recommend renting it though, it's not really a theatre-worthy film.

Coming into this one, I knew nothing of the movie and nothing of the lead actors (I've never watched Gossip Girl), although I've always liked Michael Keaton and, of course, Carol Burnett. It's a pleasant, effective coming of age-type story.It helps that I didn't know Alexis Bledel before seeing this film. With no 'baggage' about other characters she might have played, I felt she was excellent in the role, giving a nicely understated performance, with a delicate beauty that gives her a definite presence on the screen. She brought a nice mix of perky gawkiness to the character, making the role quite believable.Keaton was fun to watch, and Burnett has always been one of my favorites, and provided most of the laugh out loud moments (there were at least a couple of those). Zach Gilford (I've never watched Friday Night Lights either) mumbles a bit too much, and tends to get lost next to Bledel. But then, that's part of the character too.While I cringed at some of the plot twists (including the ending), which seemed a bit too willful, the pacing of the editing made the film flow quite nicely, allowing the sweetness of the coming-of-age story to come through, without attempting to become slapstick about it. The supporting cast go a long way in helping to build the film's "universe." And that is the question I ask about this type of movie: Will I enjoy entering the film's universe for the duration? The answer for Post Grad: Yes, I did.

Alexis Bledel shone in the seven years of Gilmore Girls (well, six, I don't think anyone came out of the seventh season strongly) so it was no surprise that people thought she was strong enough a talent to carry this movie.And to be fair, she is by far the best thing about this film. She's funny, she makes her character's story about life post uni, as well as dealing with a friend that wants to be more, relatable and true.Unfortunately when the focus moves away from this and onto to her family life the film falls apart. Every 'quirky' character trait the writers give the family is unfunny, and normally very reliable actors begin to chew scenery. Michael Keaton in particular is embarrassing in this film.Overall this is a film that's only good in places for this reason. It's a shame because Bledel works well with the limited material and needs more opportunities to show this obvious talent on the big screen.

Many of us can relate to the Ryden character in 'Post Grad'. Having been in a similar situation and knowing that Alexis Bledel would lead the movie, I decided to watch it. The film starts off well with an overenthusiastic, overconfident and naive Ryden going to her interview and then being 'bumped off' by an arch rival. The comedy works very well (except for the Michael Keaton belt lock sequence which appears like forced humour) but otherwise 'Post Grad' moves at a very slow pace. I think Vicky could have added more comedy and gone more in depth with Ryden's struggle. Alexis Bledel is very good as Ryden Malby and I hope she gets more fine roles in great movies in the future. Michael Keaton is a little over the top but it was good to see him after a long time. Jane Lynch is poorly underused. Carol Burnett is hilarious. It was only much later that I found out that Adam wasn't played by Gabriel Mann but by an actor named Zach Gilford (who is a splitting image). Overall, it's not too bad for a one time watch but it could have been way more fun.

One would expect that an actress such as Alexis Blendel would have something known as experience by now. Tragically that is not the case. Despite her sparkling eyes there is simply nothing from her side that could sustain this comedy. The only thing about her is her cuteness but that doesn't count as talent. Jane Lynch, Carol Burnett and Michael Keaton make this movie bearable. Sadly they don't get enough screen time in this flick. Other actors seem underpaid and thus unmotivated. Rodrigo Santoro plays some Hollywood Latino douche who, out of nowhere, comes up with a quote that turns the whole movie around. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen it all. Watch it if you're really bored or if you got a crush on Alexis Blendel - avoid if not. You have been warned.

Ryden (Alexis Bledel) has just graduated from college in California. She and her best friend, Adam (Zach Gilford) are mighty happy to be done. It is Ryden's fondest wish to work as an editor for a major publishing company in the Los Angeles area while Adam, an erstwhile musician, may go to Columbia Law School. Yet, on the day she finds the perfect loft apartment, Ryden loses out on the editing job. She has no other choice but to move back home, with her sometimes unusual family. Father Walter (Michael Keaton) runs a luggage storefront and is always looking for the "hot" new thing to sell on the side. Could it be belt buckles, he asks Ryden. Mother (Jane Lynch) is fairly normal but younger brother, Henry (Bobbie Coleman) is also a bit weird and wants to build a small race car. Last, but not least, Grandma (Carol Burnett) has cancer and does things like "test drive" the comfort of coffins at the local funeral parlor. Loving them is easy but living with them is difficult so Ryden sends out resumes and goes on interviews almost daily. Meeting a good-looking male neighbor (Rodrigo Santoro) helps somewhat. But, suddenly, Ryden's relationship to Adam becomes strained, for he may want more than friendship. Will Ryden get a great job and find true love? This is a sweet and funny movie, not grand, but very satisfying. Bledel is the main reason to see it, for she is very beautiful and surely has the bluest eyes in the world, as well as talent. But, Keaton, Lynch, Coleman, Gilford, and Burnett are all fine, too, especially Keaton in an unusual role. How wonderful to see Santoro, for he is very handsome and deft. Scenery, costumes, camera work and direction are nice, also. The script has a determined quirkiness and zest with some fun touches, such as a scene involving the shoot of a guacamole infomercial. In short, if you like romantic comedy and are young or young at heart, you will enjoy this little flick.

If you're a fan of TV talkfest Gilmore Girls, Post Grad is probably as close as you're ever going to get to a GG movie. Lorelai is nowhere to be found, but Alexis Bledel is basically playing Rory and she's surrounded by a clutch of oddballs right out of Stars Hollow. If you've never seen Gilmore Girls, you'll only be able to tolerate this mildly amusing and terminally predictable film until it wears out its welcome, which it does in a very big way.Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) is a young and ambitious college graduate who's on the verge of getting the job she's dreamed of her whole life. But when that job goes to her lifelong scholastic rival, Ryden has to move back in with her parents and deal with her father (Michael Keaton), who's like a combination of Ralph Kramden and Norton from The Honeymooners. When not preoccupied by her dad or her futile job search, Ryden also falls in like with the handsome foreigner next door (Rodrigo Santoro) and remains an indifferent bitch to her best friend (Zach Gilford), who is totally in love with her while she treats him like a gay foot stool. Some funny things happen, many of which don't involve Ryden, and then screenwriter Kelly Fremon pulls a major plot point and two big emotional moments completely out of her ass and gives Ryden a weirdly anti-feminist happy ending that the character has done nothing to deserve.Bledel is a pleasant and attractive presence on screen, though her eyes are so blue that there a moments when she resembles one of the Na'vi from Avatar. Michael Keaton and Carol Burnett as Ryden's live-in grandma use their comedy chops to breathe a lot of life into shallowly drawn roles. And at only 88 minutes long, Post Grad moves along at a good enough clip to hold your interest for a surprisingly long time, given the extraordinarily ordinary story its telling. And unless you've been dying to see Rory Gilmore say the S-word, that's about all the positives to be found in this production.The negatives of Post Grad aren't that bad, but there are just so bleepin' many of them. To start with, Ryden is not all that sympathetic a girl. She starts out kind of charmingly arrogant and presumptuous, then falls back into just plain arrogant and self-pitying. When that's compounded by the exploitative nature of her relationship with Zach Gilford's character, where she knows he loves her but she's content to keep him around as a platonic sidekick, you're left with the extremely likable Bledel playing someone you wouldn't miss if she got hit by a truck.Then there's the consistently poor writing. There's a subplot involving Ryden's dad and her little brother that, and I'm not joking, consists of not much more than 5 or 6 lines of dialog and maybe a minute or two of screen time but leads up to one of those big emotional moments Fremon pulled out of her ass. I didn't even realize it was an actual subplot until it got to that out-of-left-field climax. Jane Lynch as Ryden's mom is also given nothing to work with. Her character couldn't be more unformed if she were warm Jello and couldn't be more generic if she had a bar code on her forehead. And then there's a whole scene where Ryden literally does nothing but stand around while the story suddenly becomes all about the career frustrations of the foreigner next door.By the time the ending came around and Ryden gave up all of the dreams she ever had for her life to fly across the country and be a girlfriend to Zach Gilford's character, after showing as much sexual or romantic interest in him as Barbara Streisand would have for Rush Limbaugh, I only wanted this movie to go away. Which is unfortunate because Post Grad started out rather engaging, but the plot is so badly conceived and structured that I felt like my intelligence was being deliberately insulted.Alexis Bledel could be the star of a really smart and funny film about a young woman trying to make her way in the world. This ain't it.

The storyline is mainly about the sobering process of fresh College graduates, who face "the real life" for the first time.The lead female character finds out that sheer enthusiasm and confidence alone might not suffice in the attempt to secure a future one aspires to. The lead male character learns that a combination of avoiding difficult decisions and living in denial is hardly the wisest approach to leading one's life. Granted, those are hardly ground-breaking insights, but it may still be fun to watch the process of coming to terms with the reality that those insights refer to.Most of the other characters are there for the comic element.Finally, the acting is passable considering the limitations of the script and the light-hearted spirit of the movie.

In a year of really bad comic movies ("Year One," "Observe & Report," "Funny People," "I Love You, Beth Cooper," among others), this latest effort from director Vicky Jenson (her first live-action feature after helming a series of animated films, including "Shark Tale" and "Shrek") makes a solid case for falling below all of them.A VERY solid case.And that's too bad, considering some fairly talented actors take part (including Michael Keaton, Carol Burnett, Jane Lynch, J. K. Simmons, etc.) in this trip to the principal's office that makes "Land of the Lost" seem like "A Night At The Opera." This picture is a cross between "Legally Blonde" and "Running With Scissors," and made me want to give everyone involved a month of detention.Kindergarten-level plot has Ryden Malby (the beautiful but talentless Alexis Blendel, "Sin City") graduating college with high grades and higher expectations. After failing to secure the high-powered publishing position she had been anticipating, she must now return to her parents' home and deal with her Hollyweird family, including wacky dad (Keaton), down-to-earth mom (Lynch), cheap and cranky grandma (Burnett) and bizarre little moppet, Hunter (Bobby Coleman, "Martian Child").Meanwhile, Ryden's best friend from college, Adam (Zach Gilford, TV series "Grey's Anatomy" and "Friday Night Lights"), who fancies himself a singer - he isn't - is torn between his musical career or going to Columbia Law School (don't give up your day job, man). The gangly oaf has always loved Ryden, but never tells her, even when a Brazilian romeo, Rodrigo (David Santiago, "Che," TV series "Lost") swoops in.Even more annoying subplots include running over a cat, dad's efforts to sell stolen belt buckles, grandma goes shopping for coffins, Rodrigo directing an infomercial starring "SNL's" Fred Armisen (dressed as a giant avocado) and little Hunter's desire to have the coolest soap box racer of all-time.All the while, poor Ryden continues to feel sorry for herself and dream that she is more qualified than she actually is. Then, when she might just get the job of her dreams, she's willing to throw it all away on a whim. None of the actors here - good or bad - can do ANTHING with this disjointed, stilted, clichéd and totally humorless script (by Kelly Fremon, "Streak"), told in a series of poorly conceived vignettes."Post Grad" definitely does not make the grade here, and anyone who pays good money to see this bad report card should be expelled from the theater immediately.

Vicky Jenson's 'Post Grad' is a surprise from the year gone by, 2009. A film that entertains in those 87-minutes, leaving it's viewer happy, most importantly not making you regret the time you devoted in this flick.'Post Grad' was a critical & commercial bomb, and that's unfortunate. Agreed, this isn't an amazing film in any aspect, but a film, as mentioned, that entertains. The film didn't get it's due, hopefully it should do profitable business in the video-DVD circuit.The direction is decent, the writing is passable, the performances by Alexis Bledel, Michael Keaton, Carol Burnett stand out.All said & done, watch 'Post Grad', it's worth a watch.

The film has a reasonable premise with a girl graduating from college and looking to enter the job market in the writing field. It soon gets bogged down into other stories, some of which are inane.Michael Keaton plays the free spirited father who gets into trouble for selling items, not knowing that the latter were stolen. We never find out what happened there.Carol Burnett's part is essentially wasted as Keaton's mother, who hides her money all over the place. She tries to display her usual humor, but the writing here holds back her potential to create more in her role.The story comes down to commitment and following your ambitions.

The storyline, cast, scenery, and such are remedy for a decent product. The more I see it, the scenes are yes quirky but believably normal. Some comments I've heard about this is that the 1 star raring is deserved but I wish this film was reconsidered considering the content. The editing may have been off or something but the meat of the movie is charmingly comfortable to watch. The lines are great, don'tcha think? I'm keeping this as more of a discussion topic rather than an actual review. From the house, the family car, the boyfriend situation, the temptations lurking next door, the cat scene, I mean there are so many parts to this movie that is lovable.

"Ya, this whole post-graduation thing is not exactly turning out the way I planned. I just thought I'd be doing something amazing by now." - Ryden Ryden Malby (played by Alexis Bledel) faces a movie version of our current times as she realizes that the college degree she has long desired and planned for is not always worth its weight in gold. Yet even as things fall apart around her, she begins to discover that all her planning on having control and the world in her hands was not focused on what she really needed in life. Luckily there is family and friends to steer her the right way, whether she wanted it or not.Carol Burnett, Michael Keaton, and Jane Lynch also star as Ryden's family that keeps her sane, insane, and interesting throughout the movie.Jam Movie ReviewsFull DVD reviews at http://jammoviereviews.blogspot.com and http://hollywoodteenzine.com

It's entertaining at first to watch what life is like after school. Just because you graduate from college doesn't mean you'll land a dream job, or any job at that, right away. So the main character finds the difficulties in life after college, OK I buy that. At the end she loses her boyfriend, but gets her dream job. That could happen I guess. After it's all said and done she quits her job to follow her boyfriend. At the age of 22, to throw your career/job away for a relationship is a horrible idea. If you're not happy by yourself what makes you think you'll end up being happy with someone else. Especially when you were together you weren't happy to begin with. For all the young seeking professionals out there, establish your life first! So she ran to New York to be with her boyfriend and quit her job. Doesn't she remember how hard it was to get the job in the first place?
