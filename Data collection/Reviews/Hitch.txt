This film was not about stereotypes, nor dance moves, nor pickup lines, really. This film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it wasn't "groundbreaking" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York couldn't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the "hutzpah" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not ones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those raking in seven figures, of course. The thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. It was a funny two hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, become immersed in the characters, and smile.

Will Smith is Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a long-time bachelor who has become known as the New York City "date doctor" who charges to help men get the women of their dreams. Although he helps all these other men, he somehow is not able to have nearly as much success with Sara (Eva Mendes), the woman he himself loves.Hitch is a safe yet funny and entertaining romantic comedy. The premise sounds pretty good and the execution is also pretty good. Yes, it is very predictable and kind of cheesy. However, that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. I think Hitch is better than most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year because the characters are likable and Smith & Mendes have enough chemistry together to make the film work. Will Smith is very charming as Hitch. He plays the role well and he never gets annoying. It's also nice to see him in a film that doesn't involve a bunch of things blowing up. Eva Mendes also gives a pretty good performance and she is also very pretty.Surprisingly, the best thing about Hitch is Kevin James. His performance is funny and also pretty realistic. The only problem is that most of his scenes appear in the trailer and this lessens the effect. I never really liked him before but now I hope he makes more movie appearances. Out of the four main actors, Amber Valletta is the weakest. She gives an average performance and she just doesn't fit well with the other three. The rest of the supporting actors are also pretty funny, especially the customers that ask Hitch for help.The only problem I really have with Hitch is that it plays it too safe. If it was a little more edgier than the film could have been really good but it still stands an enjoyable romantic comedy. It's not really surprising that the film is safe since Andy Tennant is the director. He directed It Takes Two and Sweet Home Alabama. He's like the king of harmless, fluff films and Hitch is his best work to date. Another thing that bothered me was the running time. 118 minutes is too long for a predictable story and it does take a toll on the audience. I think it's bad since the story is by-the-numbers and the film takes awhile to reach obvious places. If it was a little shorter, than it would have been fine. In the end, Hitch is an enjoyable romantic comedy and one of the funniest films I have seen this year. Rating 8/10

Not having seen the film in its commercial debut, we just caught with it via DVD. Expecting the worst, "Hitch" proved to be a pleasant experience because of the three principals in it. Thanks to Andy Tenant's direction, the film has an easy pace, and while predictable, the comedy has some winning moments.Hitch is a sort of "date coordinator" for losers like Albert, who is not exactly what one would consider a hunk. Yet, Albert is a genuine guy who, without some professional help would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out. Enter Hitch, to prepare him to overcome the obstacles that he can't overcome, and even though Albert stays overweight and never gets to master social graces, he conquers us because he is a real, in sharp contrast with all the phonies making the rounds in Manhattan.The basic mistake most production designers make, when preparing locales for Hollywood films, is how out of touch with reality they are. The apartments in which they situate these characters are so rare to find that only by the magic of the movies can these people live in places likes these. Evidently most of the movie people are dealing with fantasy since most city dwellers would kill for spaces so fabulous as the ones they show in the movies, let alone these same people depicted in the film would not be able to afford them.Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way to charm without doing much. The surprise of the movie though, is Kevin James, who as the overweight Albert, not only win us over, but he proves he can hold his own in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is fine as the main interest of Hitch. In minor roles we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport, and Phillip Bosco, among others."Hitch" is a fun film to watch thanks to the inspired direction by Andy Tenant.

I don't think that there is much to say except that it is Will Smith. You can never go wrong with Will Smith throw in a little Michael Rapaport(Beautiful Girls), and Kevin James(King of Queens) you know you are in for laughs. I especially liked the movie because being a big Will Smith fan, I liked the fact he ventured out into a different role, from the past few films (nothing against the last few films just thought this one was a good twist). Also if any of you are looking forward to more good Will Smith movies, December 2006 he releases another movie that is also a little bit of a change and that is the "Pusuit of Happiness", guaranteed to be an instant hit. Not only does it show a different side of Will but it also stars his son Jaden Smith. There are still plenty more films coming from Will so be prepared for greatness, and also I am waiting for the Bad Boys III.

Will Smith's first full court press into 'Rom-Com' was a disappointment with a few exceptions (mainly in the slap-stick, physical comedy scenes). Will's love interest, Eva Mendes is a Latina beauty to behold but she & Will had little to no on screen chemistry. Eva could take a tip or two from Salma Hayek: remember to act while being while being gorgeous. The script is text book pap with a lot of clichés on male insight into the female psyche (I had no idea women find men paying attention to what they say a Turn-On...who knew?). Kevin James is a force of nature however & out shined the rest of the cast. This guy is too large for the small screen & I don't even watch 'King of Queens'. I thought actress Amber Valletta & James were a far more believable match even though both their parts were largely underwritten.

I expected a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible. Glad to see him in a major motion picture for once!The movie works, because the actors play their parts perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with his never ending charm; Kevin James is hilarious, and Eva Mendes...well, let's just say she plays that bitch/sweet/annoying role to the best of her ability.What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even have to try to be lovable. He just was!! The "date doctor" had all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect of ways, and never ever went over the top.The funny parts are hilarious...and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable.I totally recommend this movie. And no, it is not a chick flick.

Hitch (Will Smith) is the Date Doctor. He fixes up guys to get out their inner beauty for the girls of their dreams. Albert (Kevin James) is a hopeless slob pining for the beautiful socialite Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). He's her junior tax consultant, and she doesn't even know he's alive. Sara (Eva Mendes) is a mud raking columnist. For some reason, Hitch can't get it together when it comes to her. Then she discovers what he actually does and puts it in the papers.Will Smith is actually loveably charming. The character could have come across as a douche. Kevin James is at his maximum adorableness. Will Smith and Eva Mendes get into too much slapstick. The secondary rom-com with Kevin James is very touching. It's a rom-com with just enough originality and charm.

Hitch, to some people might be the funniest movie of the season. Some might think it isn't. There were scenes that were kind of hilarious. Kevin James did a great job playing a secondary role. Eva Mendes is gorgeous. Will Smith is always funny in his movies, not matter what. Even if it is action. Will Smith needs to do more movies like this, romantic comedies. I thought he did a good job in "Hitch".In romantic comedy, Alex "Hitch" Hitchens (Smith) is New York City "date doctor" who has helped men to try and get the women of their dreams. While coaching Albert (James), a meek accountant who likes a celebrity (Valletta), Hitch finally meets his match in the person of the gorgeous, whip-smart Sara (Mendes), a gossip columnist who is on to him.Hitch is probably the best romantic comedy of the year. But if your expecting to be laughing you a$$ off, don't expect that. But overall, I enjoyed it. 7.5/10

I really liked the first part of the movie. but second part is a horrible mess, cringe and unwatchable.
Why does he want to be with her after what she did? Why people in these movies say I love you after seeing each other 2 times?

I saw this movie screened last night, and you know what? I liked it. For the most part, it's a by the numbers 'chick flick', but makes no pretensions to be more than that, and in fact, is very good for what it is.The easy thing to do would be to take potshots at this film; throw out things like 'Fresh Prince', 'getting jiggy with it', and even throw around the whole 'black dude making a white dude cool' angle; but that's too easy isn't it? Like shooting fish in a barrel.No, this isn't a Wes Anderson film. The humor is rather broad, though much it very funny. Of course you won't see it up for an Oscar (what a tired joke that is); nor does it contain Quientin Tarantion-esquire dialogue or groundbreaking visuals.But taken for what it is, a romantic comedy, it really is very good. Great chemistry between all the leads. Eve Mendes is gorgeous. And Kevin James steals nearly every scene he's in. It gets a bit sappy towards the end (don't all mainstream romantic comedies though?), but if you're looking for a above average date movie with more than a few belly laughs, this is your film.A solid B+.

This film was very much so characterized by moments -- moments in which it was quite funny, and other moments where it was very touching in its' message concerning love and relationships. However, other than these isolated moments and scenes, it was not worth watching.I felt as if Will Smith and Kevin James did terrific acting jobs, and played very well off of each other. They were a great comic duo and never did I feel that the comedy was either forced or unnatural, and in this regard, the film was impressive. However, other than many of these scenes, the film left me with much to be desired.Though Will Smith carries the film very well, the dialog was trying on my nerves -- sometimes to the point of being distracting from the movie. A lot of the dialog was so corny I could not believe that somebody could say these things aloud and keep a straight face! Furthermore, the story is a bit unbelievable and over-the-top.However, the main spirit of the film and the moments that Will Smith and Kevin James share were very well done, and overall, it was decent enough of a film to watch. I would recommend this as a good film for anyone who wants to share a romantic evening with a light mood, or to anybody who enjoys fast-paced comedy. However, this is by no means one of the better films I have seen, and I wouldn't recommend anybody to go out of their way to see it.

This movie was a total disappointment. I thank god that i only rented it, and not bought it. First of all, the movie was SO long. The scenes just took too long to progress and it was really really really long. I must admit that the acting was good. The story was good,but i think that it lacked something. All of the people that say it was hilarious: its not. Its not really that funny. I would rate this more of as a chick flick or a romantic comedy instead of a comedy. i just think they could have done "more" with this movie. It was such a good story, they just didn't work with it. Its too long and the pace of the movie is really slow. I guess you could rent it. Don't buy it though. ******

If I could pick one movie that is at least 90% underrated. It is this movie !The whole theme of the movie is unique and fun to watch. It has comedic moments that land every time . You generally care for the characters and with that , you care about the romance in this movie. You can relate with a lot of the characters in this movie which really comes out as a big surprise for a movie with this imdb rating. Will Smith proved once again that he is very charming actor and character in the movie. Maybe certain situations are tiny bit over the top but the ending is satisfying and the movie generally succedes in what it is.7.2/10PlatinumanYT.

Last evening I had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie Hitch. I was stunned and amazed. Will Smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he isn't always associated with. He proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I've always like him on "The King of Queens" but this role really brought him into the light more, and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future. The movie was funny and adorable and I recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine. The mix of comedy, romance, and drama left me feeling complete. It's nothing like most "chick flicks" in the sense of tears and sadness, but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females. I encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from Hitch. TWO WAY BIG THUMBS UP!!!

First off there is nothing new about Hitch. It contains all the clichés of rom-coms and adds nothing new. What it does have is a likable lead performance from Will Smith which carries the movie.Without the right leading man Hitch could have been terrible but Smith is perfect. He makes Hitch cool and likable and is a very good comedy actor. Eva Mendes does her job well as the cynical object of Hitch's affections who is eventually won over but the best supporting role comes from Hitch's hapless client Albert. Albert is almost so pathetic that you want him to get the girl he shouldn't be able to. He also gets the films funniest moment.The New York setting works well and is used to add to the film rather than just be a setting. Overall Hitch is enjoyable formulaic fun which is helped by some good performances. Recommended.

I just really enjoyed this movie. I don't laugh out loud easily & this one did it. Kevin James was a riot. The humor wasn't silly and most of the characters were as real as people ever get in romcoms. The movie relied on relationship rather than sex, which is a huge plus for me.

This was a movie that, at the end, I thought "Now that was an enjoyable 2 hours!" I hate spending around $20 (not including baby-sitting $$) for my husband and myself to have that "It was OK" feeling.I think I like Will Smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero. He was well cast in this. His character was very likable, as was Kevin James'. There were several laugh out loud scenes. It's also a romantic movie, so guys, if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her to this. Women will like it as much as any chick-flick, but I wouldn't categorize this as one. There is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. I think that's one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. It has romance AND slapstick. I don't usually like slapstick that much, but it wasn't overdone and I can't think of any those scenes that didn't deliver laughs.I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband said to me after it was over was "I want to see it again!"

This film was not about stereotypes, nor dance moves, nor pickup lines, really. This film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it wasn't "groundbreaking" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York couldn't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the "hutzpah" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not ones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those raking in seven figures, of course. The thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. It was a funny two hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, become immersed in the characters, and smile.

"Hitch" starts off well, with some genuinely good advice for men and their relationships and introduces to us the interesting characters. Basically the story is about Hitch (Will Smith), a man who knows all of the ropes when it comes to dating women, taking Albert (Kevin James) under his wing. Normally the guy would have as much chance of getting together with the apple of his eye (Amber Valletta as Allegra) as a skyscraper has of surviving a Godzilla attack, but Hitch is a real pro, so love might just be in the air.I never thought I'd say this but Kevin James is actually good in this movie. Will Smith is charming as usual, but the both of them really work together. There's chemistry between the actors and there are ample touching, funny and even romantic moments (well, not between James and Smith). When the two male leads are doing their comedic parts, the film is enjoyable and when it's being truthful, it feels genuine. What really hurts the movie is the last third of the running time. The story was deliberately avoiding the usual tropes that romantic comedies always have to labor through and then it flat-out turns into a generic romance plot. Why was it necessary to include the big misunderstanding, the chase, the earth shattering revelations and the dramatic resolution, all because no one can just sit down, talk and explain themselves to the other people? This is a movie that contains one of my all-time pet peeves because just like in every bad horror movie where the dumb teenagers get themselves killed because either they've never seen a horror movie in their entire lives, or horror movies just don't exist in this film, the people of "Hitch" suddenly all lose their brains and make the same dumb mistakes we've seen over and over. For its good parts "Hitch" is worth seeing but unfortunately it fumbles the ball right before the end and falls just short of being a truly great, original romantic comedy. (On DVD, October 30, 2012)

What - a Will Smith movie with nothing blowing up? I was all prepared to hate this movie. I mean c'mon, a chick flick with Will Smith? It seems Will Smith can only play one character - himself - but in this one he tones that down and comes across as a real human being.I was so surprised by this movie. I ended up laughing through the whole thing and came to care for and relate to all the characters.There was NOTHING about racial stereotypes. It wasn't about a black guy teaching a white guy to dance at all. It was about a bunch of characters who legitimately grow from the first scene to the last.Take you girlfriend and go!

Will Smith is fabulous. Elegant, handsome, funny, with an irresistible childish maturity. I hope one day he'll get the comedy his talent really deserves. "Hitch" is smooth, I hand you that, but the formulaic code by which the implausible proceedings unfold, makes the whole damn thing very irritating. I didn't believe in the melt down of Eva Mendes for a minute. The happy ending made me think and predict a "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?" in their near future. There is an element of hardness and of selfishness that the cuteness couldn't mask. I couldn't help longing for Billy Wilder and I.A.L Diamond, for a moment of truth, no matter how ugly. Real comedies have that from Lubitch farces to Rock Hudson/Doris Day pastiches. None of that is present here. A few moments with Kevin James and the unquestionable charm of Will Smith will see you through, but that, unfortunately, is hardly enough.

Is hard to find the right girl, and this movie know how to show it. Will smith plays really well hitch, to the point that you learned alot listening to him.To me this movie is already a classic.

Hitch (Will Smith) is the Date Doctor. He fixes up guys to get out their inner beauty for the girls of their dreams.

Recap: Alex Hitchens is the DateDoctor, giving advice to insecure men how to act to get in touch with their love interests. He sort of creates opportunities and possibilities. Now he's got a big challenge on his hand, Albert Brennaman is secretly in love with his boss, Allegra Cole. Two problems though, Allegra is a rich celebrity, Albert is not, and Allegra is famous, leading to that her love-life is of prime interest to gossip newspapers. Such a reporter is Sara, and she is very good at her job. Though she works to cover a lot of love affairs and goes to a lot of parties, her own love life is closed down. Well that was until she met this interesting and original guy in a bar. Who? Yes, you guessed it, Alex Hitchens. So that's the drama. Alex helps Albert and is interested in Sara. Sara is covering Albert and Allegra and finds Alex attractive, and she is definitively interested in this mysterious DateDoctor she hears about. Well... the situation is set up to explode, and it will.Comment: A very sweet, actually very funny movie. Most romantic comedies involving insecure men that tries to get their dream girl is usually a journey in embarrassing moments where the guy (mostly) makes a fool of himself. Well, there are those moments in her too, but they are mixed up with some nice moments of situation based comedy and dialog, and also some nice tricks and unexpected turns. I must say, Will Smith does a very good Alex Hitchens and also narrates the beginning of the movie in a nice fashion. Nice casting. The rest of the cast is very good as well, although they do not really rise to Smith's level.7/10

Last evening I had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie Hitch. I was stunned and amazed. Will Smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he isn't always associated with. He proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I've always like him on "The King of Queens" but this role really brought him into the light more, and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future. The movie was funny and adorable and I recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine. The mix of comedy, romance, and drama left me feeling complete. It's nothing like most "chick flicks" in the sense of tears and sadness, but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females. I encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from Hitch. TWO WAY BIG THUMBS UP!!!

Hitch (Will Smith) is New York's greatest matchmakers, known as the date doctor who guarantee's to get you the girl of your dreams in just three dates, and that's exactly what Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) wants when he gets aspirations of true love with a beautiful heiress, Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta) Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) is a tabloid reporter who is investigating the date doctor, completely oblivious that she is already dating him.Hitch was way above my expectations, the cast are all very believable and easy to identify with, showing genuine emotions and frailties. The story is both interesting and fresh, and the script is hilarious throughout.7/10 Definitely worth a viewing

This is a comedy/romance movie directed by Andy Tennant, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James.It is about a professional dating doctor -Will Smith - known as 'Hitch' who helps men to land dates with the women they are interested in. He is currently helping a shapely, clumsy Albert who is obsessed with a very powerful, famous and rich woman called Allegra. At the same time, Hitch has become interested in a gossip columnist, Sara, - Eva Mendes - who has been assigned to write about Allegra. When the best girlfriend of Sara has a love disillusion with a man that Sara thinks that is a client of Hitch, she plots a revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation This film is not one that men should see as it has a lot of male-bashing and both subtle and blatant male-hating. There are also double standards that you would have to be blind not to spot. Hitch and Sara are both very guarded around the opposite sex, Hitch still likes women despite his burns from them in the past and is teaching men to make them happy. But of course Sara, is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments along the lines of "men want to have sex with anything that walks." Shes self-obsessed and knows she looks like a goddess and knows there are no 'real men' out there. What annoyed me most of all was the 'bad' guy who wanted a quick fumble with Sara's best friend who is the classic example of a defenceless 'victim' and even after being turned down physically by Hitch, receives as blow to the pills from Sara, after which she says "Now I'm satisfied." Add to that the "women are still oppressed" vibes you get from Allegra not being allowed to spend her own money after asking permission from a table of men. In spite of all the rubbish assumptions and generalisations - Women can always tell when you ain't being straight with them? - this movie does have the correct point that in America, love simply doesn't exist. There are some funny parts in this film, such as Albert and his dancing habits but this film overall, only beats the dreadful film Honey by a marginal amount.

I just really enjoyed this movie. I don't laugh out loud easily & this one did it. Kevin James was a riot. The humor wasn't silly and most of the characters were as real as people ever get in romcoms. The movie relied on relationship rather than sex, which is a huge plus for me.

Most Romantic Comedies always end up falling into the trap of clichéd story lines. While Hitch has a new concept, it too tends to veer off into the predictable. Nevertheless, what is enjoyable is the way the movie is presented - It is well edited, slick and the story moves at the perfect pace. You never feel that the storyline is dragging.Will Smith plays Alex Hitchens, a 'date' doctor who teaches clueless men how to impress women into going out with them. His latest client is Albert Brenneman (Kevin James), whose besotted with a client of the accounting firm where he works. The problem is that the client happens to be Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a rich socialite whose circle of friends wouldn't normally include a lowly accountant like Albert. This portion of the movie resonates very well since it tries to impress upon us that true love can cross all barriers, especially social ones, and Albert's declarations of love for the wealthy and supposedly out of reach Allegra are heartwarming.Hitch on the other hand is a Player, the exact opposite of Albert when it comes to women. He has his theories on how to go about things with women and they're tried and tested, as can be seen from the many clients he's had over the years. But he finds he's unable to put his theories into practice when he bumps into Sarah (Eva Mendes). His first two dates with her end up being disasters. But he still finds himself falling for her. Sarah, who works as a gossip Columnist (and has Adam Arkin for a Boss) is trying to follow up a story about Allegra Cole and her latest breakup. Hitch's attempts to help Albert and Sarah's efforts to find out the truth about Albert and Allegra lead to friction between Hitch and Sarah.The movie here fades into predictability, with Hitch philosophizing about the dangers of love and ending up being accused of selling something he doesn't believe in to his clients. But, on a happy note, the movie doesn't go down the vulgar route even once and tends to lay a great deal of emphasis on love rather than sex, which means it might appeal to a greater audience than a typical sex comedy.Hitch isn't spectacular but it is definitely solid and well made - It might be a great movie for a date, but it also has things which single people can appreciate and learn from. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I rate it a 7 out of 10 for excellent direction and better than average acting, especially from Smith (who restrains his tendency to overact) and James, whose performance was excellent. Mendes could have done better, but as a bonus, she looks stunning in practically every shot. So all in all, Hitch is good enough entertainment for an evening at the Cinema, especially if you have a date to keep you company.

After a razor-sharp, if a bit unbelievable, opening sequence, this settles into a slightly humorous tale of a dating specialist. If you have the patience to wait five minutes between laughs, then you may be all for it. But there was something just a little too breezy about the whole thing, that I just didn't fall in love with it. At first you think Smith is pulling a "Ferris Bueller" by addressing the camera. But this is suddenly dropped and only referred to again in the final shot. But Smith is given some insightful material on dating, men and women, and the tricks used to acquire such. Some on-target, like a guy offering to buy a tired female jogger an ice-cream. Or implausible, with the opening nonsense involving a dog in a bag(??) and a faked accident. They then set up the James/Smith partnership, which I was surprised was not the core of the film. Because it's Will Smith, I guess the makers felt necessary to give him a romantic sub-plot as well. The James bits, though a bit ham-handed and too reliant on slapstick, had a certain charm because he and Smith click on screen. But the woman James is chasing---a dead ringer for Cameron Diaz---doesn't evoke that "dreamgirl" quality that an audience would root for. Later it's time to delve into the Mendes/Smith courtship, which is more sluggish. Mendes, an oddly faced actress (sometimes she's cute, sometimes she looks like a guy), is one of those spit-fires who seems like it'll take a crowbar and some dynamite to get into her heart (punctuated by an incredibly forced "meet cute" in a bar, laden with annoying third-person chat).Which leads to another problem with Smith's elaborate dates. Yeah, it would be nice if we all had thousands of dollars to go jet-skiing around the East River, or have a private tour of Ellis Island. And don't get me started on the "everybody forgives everybody" happy ending. Plus movie-junk where everyone is connected in some way or another. He knows her, but she finds out it's him, and he didn't know she talked to that guy...ugh. Or the fact that Smith is outed as "The Date Doctor" and it turns into tabloid fodder all over Manhattan. Like anyone would care there's a misinterpreted player out there trying to coach guys on how to score with women. Snore. But if you're a viewer who can disregard that and suspend disbelief, you'll at least laugh here and there over the course of the running time.
