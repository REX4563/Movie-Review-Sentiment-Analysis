Wow! This movie is the sort of movie that picks you up by the neck and drops you right in the middle of the excitement - literally. The way the movie is shot with the camera is amazing. It is like you are there yourself, being a part of that horrible experience of being boxed inside a relatively small area and being stalked by crazed infected people.The infected were great, good make-up and effects, and brought a lot of excitement to the movie.The scenery and sets brought life to the movie. It was so dark and brooding, that it totally made the screen come alive with sense of dread and enclosing doom. It all came together for a good sense of claustrophobia and hopelessness."Rec" had a good cast of actors. Everyone portrayed their roles well and made the characters stand out as believable and real people.This is one of the better horror/thriller movies in a while, and it have a fresh sense of dread to it, which helps spices up the genre. The bad thing about "Rec" is that Hollywood decided to tap into the success of the Spanish movie and Americanize it. Usually Hollywood remakes of non-American movies is crap and an insult to the original versions. But seeing past Hollywood's greed, "Rec" is a really good movie that anyone with a taste for horror (and zombie movies, despite these here not being typical zombies) should watch.This movie will keep you at the edge of the seats.

As previously commented, this is a hand held camera ala Blair witch type film made in a convincingly realistic style and gives the impression is real life rather than actors in a film.Without spoiling too much,it is a classic Zombie film in an up-to date setting that although gory in parts aims more for the realism of its characters than on the more usual Hollywood special effects and settings that most try to emulate (but fail miserably at usually,especially when have a budget anywhere near the one obviously used in this film).Do not get me wrong,low budget or not its excellently acted by its participants, not one seemed fake or out of place in their environment,and the script did not at any time seem contrived or out of place for the circumstances. The viewer can easily identify both with the characters and their re-actions to whats going on around them.I have nothing bad to say of this film considering the restraints of the budget which may have been improved by better lighting etc, and i highly recommend any scare fans to watch this,as although there are only a few set pieces those that are in it are ideally filmed and timed,bit like when the head came out of the sunken boat in jaws-you know its going to happen if seen it before (or just listen to the music heh),but even so it still makes you jump due to its perfect timing-and the set pieces in this film have the same effect. (And there are plenty of gore effects between the big scares to keep you interested too)All in all a well made and terrifying film set in a situation that,if happened to you,you could easily see your own potential reactions portrayed by one or more of the characters-which just makes it all the more realistic and scary.

There's a lot of these shaky-cam movies around at the moment, and among your "Cloverfield"s and "Diary Of The Dead"s this low budget Spanish movie may seem like the underdog, but it's punching way above its weight.Filmed by a TV crew stumbling upon something very nasty happening in an apartment block, the movie is shot and acted brilliantly, the sense of unease gradually giving way to all out terror. While it's obviously derivative of movies like "The Last Broadcast" and "The Blair Witch Project" it manages to deliver in a way that those movies couldn't thanks to some brilliant set-pieces. It's not even out in the UK yet and Hollywood have already remade it (the inevitably inferior "Quarantine") but do yourself a favor and spend an evening in the dark with the original. You'll regret it, but in the best possible way. Terrific.

This is truly a superb horror movie. I loved this movie so much I had to leave a comment. It has been a long time since I jumped off my seat a few times (way too many). It has some of the scariest scenes I have ever seen (you'll know what I'm talking about). The way it's filmed helps us to live this "nightmare" as it was for real, as if it was a news article. The "suspension of disbelief" works unlike some other titles I have seen. I'm a big horror movie fan and I must tell you: you have to see this. I'm overwhelmed, I'm frightened, I'm suspicious, I can't even sleep... It really scared me big time. There's one particular scene (you'll know, believe me) that I do not recommend for those who are easily impressionable. Go see it. One of the best horror movies I have ever seen.

One Camera
Whatever You Witness..... Never Stop Recording. Just One Witness.... A Video Camera. Experience Fear. The movie that inspired Quarantine. Trapped. No mercy. No escape. No one gets out alive.This solid movie is a terror story with plenty of gory scenes , suspense , restless horror , and in documentary style . Film itself takes place from point of sight from cameraman . It packs tension , shocks , thrills , chills and lots of gore and blood . Well worth seeing if you like shaky cameras , like ¨Blair witch project¨, ¨28 Days/Weeks¨ ,¨Cloverfield¨ or the classic ¨Cannibal Holocaust¨ . The picture was well directed by Jaume Balaguero (Fragiles , Darkness , Nameless) and Paco Plaza (Romasanta, Second name), two magnificent terror experts . Both of them are directing the second and other parts with similar team , actors (Manuela Velasco) and director of photography (Pablo Rosso) . It's remade by an inferior US adaptation , titled ¨Quarantine¨ directed by John Erick with Jennifer Carpenter, Jay Hernandez and Steve Harris , but this original is far superior . It's one of the highest earning horror movies of the last years.

REC is a film that utilises the POV (Point of View) camera technique for the entirety of its duration. It is a technique in which the person behind the camera is a character that is integral to the plot, narrative and story of the film. In brief, REC is a horror film that begins with the crew of a TV show, called While You Sleep, making a documentary about firemen. As the film progresses the crew are lucky enough to accompany the fireman on a call out to a local apartment building.Undoubtedly and unsurprisingly REC will be measured by the film The Blair Witch Project, especially given its plot and the manner in which the film plays out. Comparatively REC is also a horror, low budget, sticks to a female lead and has an ending that is very similar. Although The Blair Witch Project was a ground breaking film, given its illustrious marketing campaign and widespread fooling of audiences, if the two are to be judged purely on their viewing merits then REC is by far the superior  if anything REC is the film that the Blair Witch should have been. It is the film that I wanted to see when I queued up in the rain, 10 years ago full of hype, anticipation and adolescent excitement.Despite REC being a better film than The Blair Witch Project some critics have attacked it for employing such a tired technique that has been used too much in recent films (i.e. Cloverfield and the forth coming Diary of The Dead). The method that has been employed in REC is, I believe, a method that is now firmly embedded in the medley of cinematic processes that a film-maker may chose to exert. It seems strange to me that once a new technique is discovered or employed and put to use regularly, people and critics complain  especially when it works. Granted, if we are subjected to a recent flurry of films all using similar methods then yes, it deserves further scrutiny and what usually surfaces is that greedy studios are exploiting market trends.The film is co-directed by Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza and they have clearly dipped into the bucket of clichés with REC, but in doing so they have created something that is both fresh and reinvigorating. It should be noted that clichés aren't always a bad thing and when put to good use can give the audience exactly what they came to see. It's true that the plot is minimal and there are loose ends, but then the vast majority of horror films often suffer from these traits, and sometimes purposefully, but with REC it doesn't make the film any less enjoyable. It is also evident from the plot and the methods employed that the film is very low budget, but this does not do it any harm, instead it complements the narrative and increases the films appeal.I believe the true quality of the film lies in its ability to cleverly use the history of the genre and the bare minimal of resources to its maximum potential and, unlike Cloverfield, there's little room to doubt the reasons for the cameraman to continue filming and this is (like Blair Witch) due to the fact it's his job. He is there to film a documentary and in true cameraman style his instincts take over. The acting on show here is also a lot better than Cloverfield and the people all look normal, some are even unattractive.To put it bluntly REC contains some of the most fear inducing and scariest scenes of recent times. It achieves a level of fear that's rarely experienced in cinema and if watching the film carefully it can be seen how. REC has been made by people that are incredibly familiar with the horror genre and fans will recognise the homage's and the inspirations used, from Evil Dead, to The Shining, to 28 Days later and many more. With such a wealth of horror-viewing-experience combined with inspired film-making they are able to draw upon some of the best moments in horror history.Towards the final reels the film plays like an amalgamation of ideas and inspirations. One of which is the influence of contemporary video gaming as some scenes allude to how certain computer games work (most notably first person shooters) and this is supported by the POV technique as we, the viewer, live the character of the cameraman much in the same way a gamer lives the character he/she is in control of. This notion is furthered by the different levels in the apartment building, the films use of rooms, the final scenes and several allegories to various computer games including Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark and Silent Hill.For a feature film it is incredibly short at only 75 minutes, in fact it is closer to the length of a TV documentary which is perhaps its aim. I cannot recommend this film enough and have even tried to construct my review in a way as to not give too much away; as it is a film that needs to seen. Watch it with the lights off, with a friend and in a small room. Enjoy.

I am not usually commenting on movies here (i rather read other people's comments) but i just finished watching REC and i felt i really had to comment, even if it's just to get my heart rate down ! First of all let me say this is one hell of a terrifying movie, i think i don't have to repeat the synopsis (several people already did that before me)...the story doesn't seem to be very original, we all have seen zombie movies before. But because of the claustrophobic setting this is totally different after all. It's a brilliant move to let it take place in an apartment building, with limited space. Also the first person way it's shot (which has done before as well) adds to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie. That and quite few great scares (which you really won't see coming from a mile away like a lot of (Hollywood) "horror" movies) and the great (and shocking) ending, makes this movies one of the best horror flicks i have ever seen. Literally. And believe me, i have seen a lot of them. Hollywood...watch and learn ! You don't need gallons of blood and body parts flying around to make a movie that will scare the living hell out of you !

Watched it at Sitges Internation Film Festival.Now.. Not being a fan of "home-made" cinema I was extremely suspecting about this film. The first 5 minutes really put you down.. I was thinking "Oh no.. Not another amateur experiment please!".. But that's exactly what they are meant for.After you relax and even prepare for occasional laughter at how bad a film it is the story slowly swirls and sinks in you with pulsating intensity and believe me: You are going to jump all over your seat for the rest of the film.Please: Do not take kids with you unless they are grown up enough to deal with horror movies or you are up to a few non-sleep nights full of tears and nightmares.If you love good horror movies you'll love this one.

[ Rec ] (2007) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Extremely intense horror film has a news woman (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman doing a TV show and following a group of firemen as they do their job. They are called to an apartment building where a woman is having some type of fit but once there they discover a lot more is going on and soon they have been locked up inside the complex and the health officials on the outside refuse to let them out. Soon more people begin to get bitten and transform into some type of creature. This is yet another film where a hand held camera tells the entire story, which is something we've seen in stuff like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and DIARY OF THE DEAD. This film here is extremely fast paced, intense and has several scenes that will certainly have you jumping out of your seat. This is an incredibly well made little thriller that's a rare example of a hyped up horror film that actually lives up to everything you've heard. I really wouldn't call the film original because I think it takes the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD set up and mixes it with the hand held camera but even though it's not original it still proves to be the perfect example of how to pull everything off correctly. The movie works so well that you honestly feel as if you're there in the building and actually going along with the survivors and facing the danger just as they are. The film also does a good job at letting us get to know the survivors and make us feel for them and their struggle to survive. I really enjoyed the interview segments where we get to know them as this perfectly sets up everything that's going to follow. The murder sequences are handled very well and while there's a bit of gore, the majority of them are done for suspense. The film is put together in a way that you honestly feel as if the footage is uncut, which is a major plus because the atmosphere inside this building is terrific. Velasco gives a terrific performance as the news woman even though I'd say her character gets a tad bit annoying in spots. Ferran Terraza, Jorge Serrano and David Vert all give fine performances as well. The ending, which I won't spoil, has a couple marvelous sequences including one extremely dark scene that will make anyone jump. It's very refreshing when a horror film like this comes along and actually lives up to everything you've heard about it.

I heard about "Rec" through all the fuss over the remake, "Quarantine", and the debates and justifiable anger of many people against the remaking of films just for the sake of the language; for people who are either too lazy or illiterate to read subtitles. I'm glad I saw this. It wasn't an amazing film and neither was it an awful one, but it was good entertaining cinema and very much the kind that I like. It's obviously in huge debt to films like Cloverfield and the earlier Blair Witch Project (not relevant here but terrible in my opinion) but it really doesn't matter because this is a good film all on it's own. The progression of the film from laughable El Dorado fly-on-the-wall style docu-drama to full-on seat-jumping horror was fantastic. At times shakiness of the hand-held camera style made it hard to work out what was going on, one scene that comes to mind is when the Chinese family were killed, but this was obviously deliberate and only added to the shocks that were to come. It was also pretty funny as well, especially when it played on racist stereotypes, ie: one neighbours disgust at the Chinese family who are "always eating feng shui" and raw fish. Sadly, there were in my opinion some big faults with this film and it's always easier to point out the bad than the good. The illogical reasoning behind the building being quarantined, the hacking together of the storyline behind the infections origins in the last 20mins (which was lame and could've been left out) and the incredible annoying lead from Manuela Velasco, but in the end these things didn't matter that much and Velasco's character was killed (Yes!). It ended perfectly, any other way and I would have felt cheated. We don't want her to survive or get rescued, and she doesn't. If you can look past the faults in this film, and like I had to, try not to use your brain too much, you are in for a very enjoyable ride. Parts of it were wonderful, particularly the use of - or absence of - sound, and some very creepy and well put together shots of the zombies. An excellent effort and worthy addition to the Zombie genre with some original and genuinely scary moments. I won't bother watching the remake, I've seen the original. Thanks

Sorry to say but this movie represented a disappointing, annoying and a plain old unpleasant experience. It is plagued with obvious inconsistencies and highly predictable twists. The characters talk (yell) too much and argue senselessly throughout the course of the movie. The immersive effect of seeing through of the eyes of the cameraman is annihilated by the desire to escape this environment where everybody is yelling at each other constantly. All I was wishing for the duration of this movie was for characters to die faster so I would have to deal with so many dB. The only scene that was remotely interesting was the one at the end where you get the impression there is more to this than just stupid people making a racket. My advise is if you saw some of the good horror movies of the last decades and appreciated their *not so cheap trills* approach to horror than don't waste your time with this movie.If you just want to see a story about chaos done in a chaotic way than this movie will satisfy.

WOW! I'm so proud of you Jaume!!! By some weird psychological mechanism: Balagueró being from my area in Spain, and i being a fan of terror movies, it feels so good to witness the next turn of the screw in the history of this genre! It's hard to comment on this movie without spoiling it, but i'll try. It's very difficult, after 40 years of terror movies, to make something new or special anymore. Balagueró manages to master the false documentary style to create a really scary atmosphere and the movie beats all resistance to destroy the suspension of disbelieve. The jumps in your seat are guaranteed, and the adrenaline flow is sure, so good a medicine for us lovers of terror cinema. In the process, the film has certain social issues, a message against racism, a portrayal of more than 10 characters, and the sweet drops of necessary humor. We saw a interview in the Spanish TV last week, and the directors explained that most of the "actors" didn't know what was gonna happen to them and the camera never stopped recording whatever were their reactions to horrible surprises. Only one actor knows what to do, where to go, and he is the one leading the action from one place to the other of the house. The effect is a rushed and hysteric spontaneity, pure madness... WOW! Try to watch it in a good theatre, with a good sound quality and a good screen. I hope our fellow Americans will be able to watch this before watching the Hollywood replica (Quarantined). Our small cinema industry deserves it.

Spanish cinema has a long history of cinematic horror . So does Britain it it probably wasn't coincidental that 28 WEEKS LATER the sequel to the Danny Boyle( Himself the quintessential British director ) hit 28 DAYS LATER was co-written by a Spanaird and directed by a Spanaird . In short if you're making a low budget horror movie with no sets and a small handful of actors ad-libbing then probably the only two countries that could produce something that would go on to become a surprise international horror hit would be either Britain or Spain . REC from 2007 became that surprise hit It should be pointed out of course that someone was a little bit naughty with the marketing . The trailers and TV spots in Britain failed to disclose that this was a Spanish film and indeed there was an English dubbed version which leads one to conclude that horror fans aren't given enough credit . Surely fear is an international language ? Are we to honestly believe that a lot of people wouldn't want to watch a horror film down to the fact that the characters can only communicate via subtitles ? Certainly I wouldn't recommend the dubbed version but if there's anything wrong with subtitles in this film it's to do with the startle moments where you're too busy reading the words on screen to catch the in your face shock bits that'll cause you to jump out of your seat . That said if you're listening to the actors in their original language the ad-libbed dialogue is infinitely more convincing As it stands REC is a slightly uneven film with a criticism that it's badly paced and derivative . This is true to a large extent and it's very difficult to comment on this movie without being reminded of 28 DAYS LATER , SPECIAL BULLETIN and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT . Likwise the last five minutes where journalist Angela and TV cameraman Pablo find themselves trapped in a dark apartment and the camera turns to night vision feels directly copied wholesale from the London Underground scenes from 28 WEEKS LATER but this sequence contains some of the most grotesque and effective imagery I've seen in a horror film for a very long time and its this last five minutes that earns REC a reputation as a classic European horror movie

This is one of better entries into the POV style of filming horror. But it still carries with it all the weaknesses of that sub-genre.An annoying female reports shoots a documentary about firefighters. She follows them on a call to house where an old women started screaming. As soon as they arrive the house becomes quaranteened with no way out. Inside are a couple of cops and the tenants of the apartment house. There are only a few of them. The reporter tells her camera guy to tape everything no matter what. He dutifully complies.Once they authorities meet up with the old woman she attacks and bites one of them. Eventually a man from the health authorities enters the building to check on the situation. He's mostly concerned with the injured who die and come back to life to attack the living. What ensues is panic and hysteria.The last 10 minutes things become interesting when the survivors find a room covered with newspaper articles of a possessed girl. This promises that we'll get a bit of a story, but we only get hints. Worst of all, the last minutes are filmed in old-green nightvision.This movie has a couple of good very good scares. It has somewhat of a story that while ignored during most of the movie gets really interesting at the end. What ruins this movie is the stupidity of the characters. Not one makes a reasonable decision, not even the trained authorities. Everyone is in a loud hysteria and panic. There's an awful lot of screaming and shouting as in all these fake reality-based horror movies. The cameraman doesn't stop filming no matter who is suffering or dying around him. The whole-camera centered worldview is getting sooo old, it's hard to stomach. None of the characters are likable or interesting, but then, these movie are not about people but the events of the instant.Overall and effective scary movie that can't overcome the problems of its silly format. REC2 is slightly better.

Every jump scare really scared me to death. This was just like Clover field. Where y the camera is shaky. But.... it is super effective when this stuff happens. Whenever I watch this movie I feel like I am there in this situation. And that's what good found footage films are suppose to do........ make you feel like you are there movies, such as Cloverfield, diary of the dead, the blare witch project, paranormal activity. Those films make you feel like you are there and you see the things and you just want to just yell at the screen and the people to run. A movie like REC deserves to be praise. This is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen. I loved this movie and it has made me paranoid ever since. Even up to this date. The "suspension of disbelief" works unlike some other titles I have seen. One of the best films both Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza have ever directed and I am really impressed. I would LOVE to see more movies like this.
9/10.

Movies used to have a more or less fixed camera position, later fixed to some character or point-of-view, with the action revolving around the frame. More intelligent filmmakers (e.g. DePalma, Tarkovsky) showed us what can be possible with a non-fixed camera position and clever editing, and with them the camera eye widens and also limits what the viewer sees or perceives, often having to make up the meaning or interpretation of it all. So, where to go from there? REC uses the clever idea of moving the camera eye to the non-acting cameraman, and although the idea is not unique, it is well done here. From then on, you can do things like blurring, putting it off for some time, extreme shaking, make it stand in the way, etc., all things a horror movie actually needs to build tension or relieve it.As humans we are often strangely attracted to blood and accidents, but also want to shy away from it. This ambiguity is used here very well in what we are allowed to see and not, sometimes crossing the line a bit, then again straying too far from the action, increasing our curiosity.And the movie is well constructed, with the main focus on the difference between the boring world of television and the exciting world of film. Look for example at the start scenes with a bored reporter making uninteresting material with standardized shots or the hilarious interviews after the first strange happenings and see how TV is portrayed here, and then later all the action, shots and positions in the film parts of the movie.Some things are not new: A key is needed to enter a new part of the house thereby solving another part of the mystery (Mulholland Dr.) or the ending (C'est arrivé près de chez vous / Man Bites Dog), but it still makes REC an enjoyable experience. I hope they don't screw up the Hollywood-remake Quarantined, although the title already gives little hope, with Hollywood's fixation on "explaining it all because we suppose our audience is stupid".

Wow! This movie is the sort of movie that picks you up by the neck and drops you right in the middle of the excitement - literally. The way the movie is shot with the camera is amazing.

It is also evident from the plot and the methods employed that the film is very low budget, but this does not do it any harm, instead it complements the narrative and increases the films appeal.I believe the true quality of the film lies in its ability to cleverly use the history of the genre and the bare minimal of resources to its maximum potential and, unlike Cloverfield, there's little room to doubt the reasons for the cameraman to continue filming and this is (like Blair Witch) due to the fact it's his job. He is there to film a documentary and in true cameraman style his instincts take over. The acting on show here is also a lot better than Cloverfield and the people all look normal, some are even unattractive.To put it bluntly REC contains some of the most fear inducing and scariest scenes of recent times. It achieves a level of fear that's rarely experienced in cinema and if watching the film carefully it can be seen how. REC has been made by people that are incredibly familiar with the horror genre and fans will recognise the homage's and the inspirations used, from Evil Dead, to The Shining, to 28 Days later and many more. With such a wealth of horror-viewing-experience combined with inspired film-making they are able to draw upon some of the best moments in horror history.Towards the final reels the film plays like an amalgamation of ideas and inspirations. One of which is the influence of contemporary video gaming as some scenes allude to how certain computer games work (most notably first person shooters) and this is supported by the POV technique as we, the viewer, live the character of the cameraman much in the same way a gamer lives the character he/she is in control of. This notion is furthered by the different levels in the apartment building, the films use of rooms, the final scenes and several allegories to various computer games including Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark and Silent Hill.For a feature film it is incredibly short at only 75 minutes, in fact it is closer to the length of a TV documentary which is perhaps its aim. I cannot recommend this film enough and have even tried to construct my review in a way as to not give too much away; as it is a film that needs to seen. Watch it with the lights off, with a friend and in a small room. Enjoy.

How this crap got 7.5 rating is beyond me. This movie is dumb and really annoying, characters scream all the time and they act like real idiots. For example this cop who chase this little girl, when he find her, he kneel in front of her and turn hid head in other direction, of course she bite him:) Same goes for camera, we got shots of shoes for few minutes and bs like that. Its not scary at all. Or even funny for that matter.

I am not usually commenting on movies here (i rather read other people's comments) but i just finished watching REC and i felt i really had to comment, even if it's just to get my heart rate down ! First of all let me say this is one hell of a terrifying movie, i think i don't have to repeat the synopsis (several people already did that before me)...the story doesn't seem to be very original, we all have seen zombie movies before. But because of the claustrophobic setting this is totally different after all. It's a brilliant move to let it take place in an apartment building, with limited space. Also the first person way it's shot (which has done before as well) adds to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie. That and quite few great scares (which you really won't see coming from a mile away like a lot of (Hollywood) "horror" movies) and the great (and shocking) ending, makes this movies one of the best horror flicks i have ever seen. Literally. And believe me, i have seen a lot of them. Hollywood...watch and learn ! You don't need gallons of blood and body parts flying around to make a movie that will scare the living hell out of you !

Movie started of well for me but got me irritated from mid till the end due to the lead actress overacting. As scared as she's suppose to portray, she didn't have to keep yelling throughout the whole movie. Although some of the other actors did over-do their roles in some scenes, they weren't as irritating. Some of the setup was obviously done to lead viewers for some scary moments but it seemed contrived & amateur making me feel as if i was an idiot audience. Won't go into details to spoil the movie for you. If the final third of the movie was as well thought-out as the rest of the movie, i would have given it an 8. for the most part, it serves as a good flick for horror genre viewers.

Watched it at Sitges Internation Film Festival.Now.. Not being a fan of "home-made" cinema I was extremely suspecting about this film. The first 5 minutes really put you down.. I was thinking "Oh no.. Not another amateur experiment please!".. But that's exactly what they are meant for.After you relax and even prepare for occasional laughter at how bad a film it is the story slowly swirls and sinks in you with pulsating intensity and believe me: You are going to jump all over your seat for the rest of the film.Please: Do not take kids with you unless they are grown up enough to deal with horror movies or you are up to a few non-sleep nights full of tears and nightmares.If you love good horror movies you'll love this one.

[ Rec ] (2007) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Extremely intense horror film has a news woman (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman doing a TV show and following a group of firemen as they do their job. They are called to an apartment building where a woman is having some type of fit but once there they discover a lot more is going on and soon they have been locked up inside the complex and the health officials on the outside refuse to let them out. Soon more people begin to get bitten and transform into some type of creature. This is yet another film where a hand held camera tells the entire story, which is something we've seen in stuff like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and DIARY OF THE DEAD. This film here is extremely fast paced, intense and has several scenes that will certainly have you jumping out of your seat. This is an incredibly well made little thriller that's a rare example of a hyped up horror film that actually lives up to everything you've heard. I really wouldn't call the film original because I think it takes the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD set up and mixes it with the hand held camera but even though it's not original it still proves to be the perfect example of how to pull everything off correctly. The movie works so well that you honestly feel as if you're there in the building and actually going along with the survivors and facing the danger just as they are. The film also does a good job at letting us get to know the survivors and make us feel for them and their struggle to survive. I really enjoyed the interview segments where we get to know them as this perfectly sets up everything that's going to follow. The murder sequences are handled very well and while there's a bit of gore, the majority of them are done for suspense. The film is put together in a way that you honestly feel as if the footage is uncut, which is a major plus because the atmosphere inside this building is terrific. Velasco gives a terrific performance as the news woman even though I'd say her character gets a tad bit annoying in spots. Ferran Terraza, Jorge Serrano and David Vert all give fine performances as well. The ending, which I won't spoil, has a couple marvelous sequences including one extremely dark scene that will make anyone jump. It's very refreshing when a horror film like this comes along and actually lives up to everything you've heard about it.

This is one of better entries into the POV style of filming horror. But it still carries with it all the weaknesses of that sub-genre.An annoying female reports shoots a documentary about firefighters. She follows them on a call to house where an old women started screaming. As soon as they arrive the house becomes quaranteened with no way out. Inside are a couple of cops and the tenants of the apartment house. There are only a few of them. The reporter tells her camera guy to tape everything no matter what. He dutifully complies.Once they authorities meet up with the old woman she attacks and bites one of them. Eventually a man from the health authorities enters the building to check on the situation. He's mostly concerned with the injured who die and come back to life to attack the living. What ensues is panic and hysteria.The last 10 minutes things become interesting when the survivors find a room covered with newspaper articles of a possessed girl. This promises that we'll get a bit of a story, but we only get hints. Worst of all, the last minutes are filmed in old-green nightvision.This movie has a couple of good very good scares. It has somewhat of a story that while ignored during most of the movie gets really interesting at the end. What ruins this movie is the stupidity of the characters. Not one makes a reasonable decision, not even the trained authorities. Everyone is in a loud hysteria and panic. There's an awful lot of screaming and shouting as in all these fake reality-based horror movies. The cameraman doesn't stop filming no matter who is suffering or dying around him. The whole-camera centered worldview is getting sooo old, it's hard to stomach. None of the characters are likable or interesting, but then, these movie are not about people but the events of the instant.Overall and effective scary movie that can't overcome the problems of its silly format. REC2 is slightly better.

Sorry to say but this movie represented a disappointing, annoying and a plain old unpleasant experience. It is plagued with obvious inconsistencies and highly predictable twists. The characters talk (yell) too much and argue senselessly throughout the course of the movie. The immersive effect of seeing through of the eyes of the cameraman is annihilated by the desire to escape this environment where everybody is yelling at each other constantly. All I was wishing for the duration of this movie was for characters to die faster so I would have to deal with so many dB. The only scene that was remotely interesting was the one at the end where you get the impression there is more to this than just stupid people making a racket. My advise is if you saw some of the good horror movies of the last decades and appreciated their *not so cheap trills* approach to horror than don't waste your time with this movie.If you just want to see a story about chaos done in a chaotic way than this movie will satisfy.

WOW! I'm so proud of you Jaume!!! By some weird psychological mechanism: Balagueró being from my area in Spain, and i being a fan of terror movies, it feels so good to witness the next turn of the screw in the history of this genre! It's hard to comment on this movie without spoiling it, but i'll try. It's very difficult, after 40 years of terror movies, to make something new or special anymore. Balagueró manages to master the false documentary style to create a really scary atmosphere and the movie beats all resistance to destroy the suspension of disbelieve. The jumps in your seat are guaranteed, and the adrenaline flow is sure, so good a medicine for us lovers of terror cinema. In the process, the film has certain social issues, a message against racism, a portrayal of more than 10 characters, and the sweet drops of necessary humor. We saw a interview in the Spanish TV last week, and the directors explained that most of the "actors" didn't know what was gonna happen to them and the camera never stopped recording whatever were their reactions to horrible surprises. Only one actor knows what to do, where to go, and he is the one leading the action from one place to the other of the house. The effect is a rushed and hysteric spontaneity, pure madness... WOW! Try to watch it in a good theatre, with a good sound quality and a good screen. I hope our fellow Americans will be able to watch this before watching the Hollywood replica (Quarantined). Our small cinema industry deserves it.

This movie played after Atonement in a double bill at the Venice Film Festival. Within fifteen minutes the previously full cinema was half empty with people filing out of the auditorium in panicked droves. Those who stayed were treated to the proverbial roller-coaster ride and walked out of the Sala Biennale having shared a deeply traumatic yet brilliant experience. REC had me literally screaming with terror and enjoyment. A bubbly, ambitious TV journalist reports on the seemingly dull sedentary life of an urban fire station and a call to help a strange old lady locked in her apartment hardly seems worthy covering. The chaos, mayhem and trauma that erupts when the old lady plunges her teeth into the neck of the previously sympathetic fireman is simply sensational.This is not a casual Zombie movie but the usual rules of contamination apply. The live news report style in which it is filmed invoke a jarring sense of participation which make Blair Witch feel cute, dated and comparatively boring.

This is the original that "Quarantine" was based on and this, like that one, was pretty entertaining. I think, even if you hate it, there has to be at least one scene in either one them that will cause you to sit up in your seat. They can really hold the tension. If you haven't seen this or Quarantine, It revolves around a girl making a low budget documentary about this fire department in Barcelona. They get called out to an apartment where there is a disturbance. She goes with them still filming the whole thing. Her partner is actually filming it and since he's filming it, I think you only see him a few times in the whole movie. It mostly focuses on the girl. While the firemen and she are in the apartment building, it gets quarantined and none of them can leave. A few try to leave during the movie and get shot down. It's a typical, who is the real enemy, the zombies or the government. By the way, I should've said right off, it's a shaky camera zombie movie. It's really gruesome in some seems too. The ending, to try not to give anything away is kind of chilling. The acting is pretty decent. This review is really for both the Spanish and American version, since they are both almost identical. It's just a good old fashioned zombie movie, with the shaky camera gimmick, which is so popular these days, thrown in to make it more appealing, but I think the movie industry over does a good thing a lot.

Viewed at Manchester Cornerhouse Viva film festival. REC is one of the most terrifying and thrilling horror films to come out of recent years, that displays some clever inventiveness along with the traditional 'boo' scares expected of the horror genre. Filmed from the point of view of a local Madrid TV crew who are profiling fire fighters as part of a fly on the wall documentary series. Though the night consists at the beginning of nothing much happening at all, things take an unexpected turn when the crew follow a call out to an apartment where they find a crazed old women who attacks and bites a policemen present, infecting him and turning him into a crazed zombie. Its not long before there chance of finding outside help is stopped as the authority's isolate all the apartment block inhabitants and essentially quarantine them, leading the inhabitants and the TV crew to fight against and avoid the ever increasing zombie infection. REC achieves its scares and intensity through the use of close up point of view camera, that has most notably been used in two American films this year CLOVERFIELD and GEORGE ROMERO'S DIARY OF THE DEAD, and also the night vision sequence in THE DESCENT, where the scare comes from, the camera panning to one side and revealing something you don't want to see. This use of p.o.v makes the film more intense and personal, and interestingly enough, the director who was present at the screening, explained in a Q &A after the film that he didn't tell or inform the cast of what was going to happen in the scenes thereby increasing the realism of there horrified reactions. It's this brilliant style and memorable shocks that lend REC as one of the most clever and inventive horror films of recent memory. Go see it at the cinema, as this is the only way that will make you appreciate the intensity of the film, though be prepared to be exhausted, of ever a film had the mantle of shakiest camera in the world, this is it, and also see it before the Hollywood remake QUARANTINE is released later this year.

This is a somewhat innovative Spanish horror film. A TV reporter and her cameraman doing a report on firefighters follow a call to an apartment building where something is wrong. People are turning into zombies, and the authorities seal them in.The camera style is Blair Witch inspired. For this, it works quite well. It adds energy to the movie. However I did find it somewhat tiresome after a while. As with all these hand-held camera style, there's always the illogicality of how the camera is always catching the action just right. The other problem I had was how the building was sealed so quickly. Overall, those are minor details. This horror film had some pretty good shots. It's able to maintain the pace, and get to a climatic ending.

A beautiful female TV reporter and her cameraman follow a group of firemen on a call. They go to an apartment building where loud screams are heard from an elderly woman's unit. The fireman break into her apartment. She's bleeding and screaming nonstop and attacks them. It seems she's infected and the other residents might be too. Authorities seal off the building allowing no one out and they all have to deal with each other...and the infection.VERY bloody and gory with good acting. Even better it moves quickly (it's only 78 minutes) and never stops. Very scary and unsettling. It was remade in the US as "Quarantine" in 2008. That's good too but this is better!

Movies used to have a more or less fixed camera position, later fixed to some character or point-of-view, with the action revolving around the frame. More intelligent filmmakers (e.g. DePalma, Tarkovsky) showed us what can be possible with a non-fixed camera position and clever editing, and with them the camera eye widens and also limits what the viewer sees or perceives, often having to make up the meaning or interpretation of it all. So, where to go from there? REC uses the clever idea of moving the camera eye to the non-acting cameraman, and although the idea is not unique, it is well done here. From then on, you can do things like blurring, putting it off for some time, extreme shaking, make it stand in the way, etc., all things a horror movie actually needs to build tension or relieve it.As humans we are often strangely attracted to blood and accidents, but also want to shy away from it. This ambiguity is used here very well in what we are allowed to see and not, sometimes crossing the line a bit, then again straying too far from the action, increasing our curiosity.And the movie is well constructed, with the main focus on the difference between the boring world of television and the exciting world of film. Look for example at the start scenes with a bored reporter making uninteresting material with standardized shots or the hilarious interviews after the first strange happenings and see how TV is portrayed here, and then later all the action, shots and positions in the film parts of the movie.Some things are not new: A key is needed to enter a new part of the house thereby solving another part of the mystery (Mulholland Dr.) or the ending (C'est arrivé près de chez vous / Man Bites Dog), but it still makes REC an enjoyable experience. I hope they don't screw up the Hollywood-remake Quarantined, although the title already gives little hope, with Hollywood's fixation on "explaining it all because we suppose our audience is stupid".

Every jump scare really scared me to death. This was just like Clover field. Where y the camera is shaky. But.... it is super effective when this stuff happens. Whenever I watch this movie I feel like I am there in this situation. And that's what good found footage films are suppose to do........ make you feel like you are there movies, such as Cloverfield, diary of the dead, the blare witch project, paranormal activity. Those films make you feel like you are there and you see the things and you just want to just yell at the screen and the people to run. A movie like REC deserves to be praise. This is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen. I loved this movie and it has made me paranoid ever since. Even up to this date. The "suspension of disbelief" works unlike some other titles I have seen. One of the best films both Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza have ever directed and I am really impressed. I would LOVE to see more movies like this.
9/10.

When I was watching Rec I was kind of skeptic in the beginning but that sure changed fast, once it started to get exciting it kept being exciting. The way it's filmed is a huge plus, you really get caught up in the moment of the movie, it makes it feel so much more realistic not to mention the whole virus thing instead of some supernatural thing, simply awesome.Even though it's quite a scary movie, it has some nice side jokes that gives you quite a nice laugh, I fooled my friend who hate horror movies since he is so easily frightened and even he laughed at some points. But even though there are places in the movie where you laugh, that "nice" feeling that something is about to happen doesn't go away, in fact those side jokes might make the next scene even more scary since you'll be even more surprised.This is the first movie to have actually frightened me in like 6 years so I have to say this is one of my favorite movies at the moment. I've seen it twice and I still get frightened at this one spot even though I knew it was going to happen.I give this movie a 9 / 10.

I can't understand why this movie got such a high score. I didn't know much about it when I started to watch it, and the beginning wasn't too bad; it seemed genuine. That's until we move from the fire station. Suddenly, the firemen left with the cameraman, the young reporter and practically everybody else start to overreact and the acting goes down the toilet. It doesn't look fresh anymore. Perhaps this is something to do with me understanding their language? I do not know. What I do know is that I can't find anything really original here, from the plot to the handycam/nightvision stuff... I can see pieces of other movies put together to "create" this. And, to be honest, it didn't impressed me at all. In fact, by the end of the film, the lady reporter acting was basically making me angry. Watch if you don't have anything else to do or are into this type of movies. Otherwise, you are better off with another flick.

I just liked the movie. That's all! I was alone in the movie theater, and after the movie, I went shopping to the supermarket, and I felt like everybody was strange, and moved strange. I was lucky it wasn't dark yet. The movie looks simple, but sure there is a script, and I like the humor in it, too. Next day, while having a shower, I started laughing thinking about some parts of the movie. The way the movie is recorded, it looks difficult to know how it will be possible for the movie to go on. But it gets on, and better! The fear increases because you do NOT see completely what it's happening. That's the tricky part: You (and the actors) know/don't know, see/don't see. The action and the images are not completely evident and clear. But it can be good for the movie. It's not Dawn of the Dead, it's different, but I also liked it a lot!

Spanish cinema has a long history of cinematic horror . So does Britain it it probably wasn't coincidental that 28 WEEKS LATER the sequel to the Danny Boyle( Himself the quintessential British director ) hit 28 DAYS LATER was co-written by a Spanaird and directed by a Spanaird . In short if you're making a low budget horror movie with no sets and a small handful of actors ad-libbing then probably the only two countries that could produce something that would go on to become a surprise international horror hit would be either Britain or Spain . REC from 2007 became that surprise hit It should be pointed out of course that someone was a little bit naughty with the marketing . The trailers and TV spots in Britain failed to disclose that this was a Spanish film and indeed there was an English dubbed version which leads one to conclude that horror fans aren't given enough credit . Surely fear is an international language ? Are we to honestly believe that a lot of people wouldn't want to watch a horror film down to the fact that the characters can only communicate via subtitles ? Certainly I wouldn't recommend the dubbed version but if there's anything wrong with subtitles in this film it's to do with the startle moments where you're too busy reading the words on screen to catch the in your face shock bits that'll cause you to jump out of your seat . That said if you're listening to the actors in their original language the ad-libbed dialogue is infinitely more convincing As it stands REC is a slightly uneven film with a criticism that it's badly paced and derivative . This is true to a large extent and it's very difficult to comment on this movie without being reminded of 28 DAYS LATER , SPECIAL BULLETIN and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT . Likwise the last five minutes where journalist Angela and TV cameraman Pablo find themselves trapped in a dark apartment and the camera turns to night vision feels directly copied wholesale from the London Underground scenes from 28 WEEKS LATER but this sequence contains some of the most grotesque and effective imagery I've seen in a horror film for a very long time and its this last five minutes that earns REC a reputation as a classic European horror movie
