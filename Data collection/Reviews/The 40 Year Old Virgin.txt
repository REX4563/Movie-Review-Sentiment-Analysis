Down to earth, relatable and just plain funny. The 40 Year Old Virgin is a great comedy that is genuinely funny. The movie touches on not just the struggle of the virgin but other relationship issues as well that make the film relatable. Its fun to watch Andy slowly grow into a confident man who is able to find true love. The entire cast is great, especially the supporting friends of Andy, as always Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen do not disappoint!

Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on 'The Daily Show', and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. And so begins Andy's quest into adulthood. Andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; it's a rolling in your seats comedy. Still, every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be 'The Wedding Crashers' from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly loved the ending of the film, which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of 'Something About Mary'. Very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.

Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is hopelessly single at 40 working as a tech guy at an electronic store. He has no game with the ladies and no experience with sex. His co-workers David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogen), and Jay (Romany Malco) reluctantly asks him to join their poker game. During the game, Andy let slip that he has never had sex. The guys make fun of him but then vows to get him laid. They give contradictory and generally bad advise. At a club, he goes home with Nicky (Leslie Mann) who is crazy drunk. Trish (Catherine Keener) comes into the store to buy a VCR. She has a storefront across the street selling other people's stuff on Ebay. Marla (Kat Dennings) is one of her kids. Cal tells him to keep asking questions to be mysterious and that works on bookstore clerk Beth (Elizabeth Banks).There are a lot of awkward hilarity coming from this Judd Apatow comedy. Steve Carell especially with that haircut is perfect for the role. There is nothing more painfully funny than Kelly Clarkson. At its heart, Carell is an adorable dork. The other guys are almost as ridiculous. That is why this works so well. There are so many great comedians working with such a funny idea.

If you liked "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" you will love this movie. In fact, it rejoins a couple of the supporting cast of that film, starring Steve Carrell, who played "Brick" who, in my opinion, stole that show with his clueless stares and inane ramblings. In this film, Andy, the 40-year-old virgin, gets a lot of unwanted help from his male coworkers, who are all so completely dysfunctional that they really don't have any business trying to repair anyone else's private life. The fact that Andy also still rides a bicycle and is chided by his coworkers for that, too, just seems to emphasize that modern society has turned virginity into a stigma similar to not being able to pass a driving test.Instead of wanting to lose his virginity, though, what Andy really wants is a relationship with the nice woman running a store across the street from where he works. His virginity is just a byproduct of him not finding a good relationship with a woman yet. The resulting story is actually a rather sweet romance buried underneath all of the Man Show style humor. It carries a rare message in modern film - that chastity before marriage is not a bad thing, and that everybody is running on their own schedule.

Just came out of a sneak preview for this film. It had me laughing every 30 secs. The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I hadn't bought that large coke. There are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their movies. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like P.S.). I think that Seth Rogen should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. And, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those "hip" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. Sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them. It would make for some incredibly awkward moments.

"The 40 Year Old Virgin":Judd Apatow's first time at-bat, Steve Carell's career launching pad . . . It even saved "The Office" from cancelation. That's some serious cachet, and maybe the real surprise is that (despite being so wildly 2005) it holds up so well today.Carell can't be underestimated here. He's super relatable as the guy who's never bothered with dating, and I really felt for his character when life started moving too fast. The cast has amazing chemistry and they all work together to make something that's genuinely funny (the deliveries of these jokes are incredible!). It's a legit knee-slapper.Apatow has made a career out of his raunch-with-a-heart shtick but he struck just the right balance here. The whole thing just seems to work in harmony.

Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, Wedding Crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects. Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than 'Crashers'. Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrell's character Andy and Catherine Keener's character Trish will go to, it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other. And, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both.The thing is some people may go into The 40 Year Old Virgin not knowing Steve Carrell as well as Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, as Carrell has built up his cult status on The Daily Show (one of my favorite shows on now) and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty. This is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle. He and co-writer/director Judd Apatow treat the character of Andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way, even early on as he talks to his action figures while re-painting them. It's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett (also about sexual dysfunction). As the title suggests, Andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little Pee-Wee Herman in him (the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign).So, his friends (among them Paul Rudd, Romany Mancoy, Seth Rogen, all very good comic foils) try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over Andy's head to pop his cherry, so to speak. He almost gets with a overly drunk woman, he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl, and almost with his own boss (Jane Lynch, also very funny in the mockumentaries) as a (explitive) buddy. But this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with Trish, who works across the street from him. As they build on a relationship not based at all on sex, one might worry that the plot gear of "how is he going to tell her such and such" might get in the way of the comedy. It doesn't. In fact, if anything, Carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree. For practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length, there was barely a moment I wasn't laughing, whether big or small.The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, Rudd's being the funniest). The big laughs come through because of Carrell's reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth. Keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like 'Crashers', there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise). For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, Carrell gets very high points here. And like with a Farrelly brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the 'waxing' scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise). But if you're willing not to get offended by it, there's more where that came from. This is one of the funniest films of the year.

It may feel overlong, sketchy, and familiar; but all this actually because of one single flaw, which is that the movie completely delivered itself to its message. Don't get me wrong, the message of the movie is one of its best merits (it's well-conveyed, and it makes the movie stand out from the rest of raunchy comedies). But when the plot ends up being completely driven by the moral of the story, you know that there is something wrong here. A lot of monotonous, stretched story-lines, and repetitive jokes made the movie feels as if it has overstayed its welcome. And I kept always wondering why a movie that felt so fresh and genuine, and also has a lot to say (considering its remaining running time and the almost flawless, extremely hilarious and intriguing first act and half of the second). I think I found the answer as the third act kicked off, which is to keep stretching the movie as much as it could until it reach the denouement, and hence delivers its message at the end. It ends up being pretty much a run-of-the-mill rom-com.However, The 40-Year-Old Virgin completely deserves the cult status it has achieved. First and foremost, Judd Apatow pulled off a something seemingly impossible: a combination of a crude, gross-out comedy and a heartfelt, tender romantic comedy. While these two sub-genres didn't mix very well with each other, glimpses of each of both have managed to be consistent throughout the entire movie. That's largely due to the likable and unbelievably relatable protagonist, Andy, brought to life by an outstanding, star-making performance by Steve Carell, who revealed his massive talent, showing an impressive range he would latter become famous for.All the secondary characters here have a reasonable depth that prove how this movie is really different from your typical gross-out comedy. They may be stereotypical after all, but the witty rude humor that came from them added an extra, and maybe interestingly contradictory, layer to all of them. I think all the performances are great, but Paul Rudd really stole the show.Also the movie features a young Jonah Hill in a very funny cameo. I mean, what more could you ask for?(7.5/10)

I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie.Kudos to Steve Carrell(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there wasn't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer).There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical.I will definitely go see '40 Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it.

All right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside, then I was blushing on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. Whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose.I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit, but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. If I were to say, "This movie is hilarious, go check it out!" and some sweet, little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that's just something I don't need on my conscience.So how raunchy is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mom would've walked out during the first scene. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I come to expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming, "If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down," is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate.And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.Strangely enough, despite the raunch, there's an admirable moral to the story. The movie doesn't portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin. He's really portrayed as a likable, admirable character. Sure, he's a little weird. After all, he has a framed Asia poster, "more videogames than an Asian kid," and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin. As odd as it may seem, there's a bit of an "it's OK to wait" message.But man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go. That was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. If you can handle that or talk that way yourself, then you'll love the movie.I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly ladies, you might not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross, well, this gives you a good idea.There you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. Be that your guide. It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class, mama, grandmama, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.

I know this will be very unpopular, but I found this movie to be mostly unfunny, way too long, incredibly predictable, and very base. For anyone seeking humor that does not insult one's basic level of intelligence, this is not the movie for you. There ARE some hilarious scenes, but they are very brief and sandwiched in between big fat loaves of the most low-level frat/high school humor I've seen in a while. It doesn't involve you enough to really want to see what happens, also because it rambles on for about a half hour too long.I'm a big fan of humor like old Woody Allen, The Office, Spinal Tap, and Airplane!, and this just wasn't inventive enough to hold my interest. Toilet humor does not require good writing, it just requires an audience who likes toilet humor. I'm cool with people liking it, but it does nothing for me, personally. Occasionally a bit of random, absurd humor would pop in, which was good, but it was mostly relying on cheap humor tricks that got old after the first 15 minutes, for me.Also, I don't mind people swearing at all, but after a while, I actually got bored of hearing it so freaking much.Sorry, two thumbs down here.

''The 40 Year Old Virgin'''made me laugh a lot. I don't care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as the virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest, specially because it is real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous,by the way.Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. He is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys, but seems harmless. One day, while playing poker with his friends of his work, they discover that Andy is in fact...virgin! And he is already 40 years old! After this surprising revelation, all his friends are trying to make Andy sleep with a woman...the problem is the confusions in which Andy gets in,specially now that he is really starting to like Trish, a woman he met when she was buying a DVD player in the store he works at.

"The 40 year Old Virgin" is a 2005 film that perfectly describe when and where Hollywood reached its peak, when films didn't have to worry about being politically correct, but at the same time they understand some key aspect of society, American society specially, there was inclusivity, there was some boundaries but ultimately, there was fun, it was in a few words pure entertainment.Talking specifically about the movie there are a lot of jokes that may hurt some sensibility in today society, yet they are not ill intended, and for most of people they are funny, it also has a few touchy and warm-felt moments, it talks about friendship, loneliness, love, parenthood, fear of rejection and many other sensible topics yet it doesn't never stray away from its purpose of being an irreverent comedy movie.I think this is one of the best comedy film of the last years, who can be enjoy by teenagers, young adults and adults alike.

Hey have you ever wanted to watch a really good flic? Well, here it is! Our little friend, Steve is so so adorable in this story! It's a pathway to genuine desire. Please wait until the end for the lesson! You'll love it. And the cast, Oh my gosh! They are magnificent, and so young :P.

Andy Stitzer(Steve Carell) is a 40 year old virgin who is pushed by his friend to lose his virginity. During this crusade, Andy meets many women, but one woman named Trish(Catherine Keener) catches his eye more than the others.Steve Carell shows us to be an absolute genius. His role is perfect for him and just plain "makes" the movie. The movie exceeded all expectations I could have had. The acting was great, the writing was wonderful, and the comedy could not have been any funnier for what it was. If you have seen The Office or Anchorman you would know how Steve Carell steals the show and this movie proves it more than ever. Overall, the movie is just fantastic and is the second best comedy of the year, falling short only of Wedding Crashers.I highly recommend this movie.

I saw this movie and I terrible hated despite all the commentary, what kind of humor is? I tried to laugh but only in one part I did it.If you plan to torture yourself for almost 2 hours, this is your movie.Using just sex and women like objects is stupid , the script is boring , predictable , the actors ,except CARREL, are the worst I've seen like Tom Cruise wife on Batman.I wish they don't have plans to make second part , but in this Hollywood , where's all in continuation and the same script again and again but different actors, the remakes ( I suffer when I see how great movies are destroyed) and unnecessary FX'S all is possible.I couldn't believe the rating of 7.4. there's tons of movies that deserve 1000 in rating if this deserve more than 7.

So I just watched this for the first time. It was very funny. And it had a crazy amount of big names in it and I wasn't expecting it. And all of them do what they are for really well cause sure I kept noticing all these actors but right after they came on I started seeing them as there character. Now it's hard to write some big review on this cause it's just a simple fun comedy and I'd def recommend it. And i do not really know what to say from here other then just check it out for yourself it's a classic and I can see why but ya know it's just a classic comedy nothing crazy ya know so do it check it out.

Down to earth, relatable and just plain funny. The 40 Year Old Virgin is a great comedy that is genuinely funny. The movie touches on not just the struggle of the virgin but other relationship issues as well that make the film relatable. Its fun to watch Andy slowly grow into a confident man who is able to find true love. The entire cast is great, especially the supporting friends of Andy, as always Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen do not disappoint!

Steve Carell especially with that haircut is perfect for the role. There is nothing more painfully funny than Kelly Clarkson. At its heart, Carell is an adorable dork. The other guys are almost as ridiculous. That is why this works so well. There are so many great comedians working with such a funny idea.

In the previews, "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish Lonely Guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't. Too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely. And then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. What's more, there's a movie out about it, and it's called "The 40 Year-old Virgin."The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see. He has a lovely home theater system and watches "Survivor" with his two kind elderly neighbors. He's a pretty picturesque definition of the Lonely Guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women.Now here's the real novelty with this picture: it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute, mature fashion. This is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers. It could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low. Sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community (which are, in no way, meant to be taken as gay-bashing), as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game ("Mortal Kombat: Deception," no less - the ultimate testosterone-driven fightfest for guys).As someone who is rapidly approaching 20, collects McFarlane Toys action figures AND has himself never done the deed, I found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar-themed movie could never have been. I was able to relate to the character of Andy Stitzer more than anyone in the theater because I was the only teenager present at this showing; everyone else looked like they were all past 40. A bit arrogant, I know, but would you ("you" is italicized) still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of "The 40 Year-Old Virgin"?Of course Andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with "morning rise" (don't ask), and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex. When it's first discovered Andy is a virgin, at 40, his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman, which couldn't be any further from the truth. The truth is, Andy loves women, but past traumatic experiences (revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence) have put him on the sidelines for good.David, Jay, and Cal each embark on a mission to get Andy laid, so help them all. But you know that such escapades will only end in disaster, as proved by one date with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who puts Andy through the worst drunk-driving experience I think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend.Things brighten up for Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on eBay for people. Hmmm. And with that nice-looking collection of action figures, you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him, that is if he can ever "do the deed."At last, this is the sex romp we've been waiting for. It deals with a very real issue a lot of Lonely Guys probably go through, not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let's look at the big picture: How many of us "Lonely Guys" want to be a lonely guy forever? The important thing we're taught in this picture is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I don't think he needs to go through body waxing like Andy does (which is side-splitting to be honest, and according to this website and various other news articles, was in fact real, and so was the blood on Carell's shirt afterward)."The 40 Year-Old Virgin" was directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by himself and Carell, which originated as a skit that starred Carell. Carell is sweet and human, as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut. This is probably one of the most intelligent romps I've ever seen and is not offensive (a whole lot) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's buddies, who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities, can be related to on a fundamental level.The way "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" plays out is indeed funny in the end, but I'll leave that up to you, the viewer, to observe. Surely, if anyone can go through the things Andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as Catherine Keener, then it's true: It is never too late!10/10

If you liked "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" you will love this movie.

His virginity is just a byproduct of him not finding a good relationship with a woman yet. The resulting story is actually a rather sweet romance buried underneath all of the Man Show style humor. It carries a rare message in modern film - that chastity before marriage is not a bad thing, and that everybody is running on their own schedule.

Just came out of a sneak preview for this film. It had me laughing every 30 secs. The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I hadn't bought that large coke. There are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their movies.

I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. And, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those "hip" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. Sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them. It would make for some incredibly awkward moments.

It may feel overlong, sketchy, and familiar; but all this actually because of one single flaw, which is that the movie completely delivered itself to its message. Don't get me wrong, the message of the movie is one of its best merits (it's well-conveyed, and it makes the movie stand out from the rest of raunchy comedies). But when the plot ends up being completely driven by the moral of the story, you know that there is something wrong here. A lot of monotonous, stretched story-lines, and repetitive jokes made the movie feels as if it has overstayed its welcome. And I kept always wondering why a movie that felt so fresh and genuine, and also has a lot to say (considering its remaining running time and the almost flawless, extremely hilarious and intriguing first act and half of the second). I think I found the answer as the third act kicked off, which is to keep stretching the movie as much as it could until it reach the denouement, and hence delivers its message at the end. It ends up being pretty much a run-of-the-mill rom-com.However, The 40-Year-Old Virgin completely deserves the cult status it has achieved. First and foremost, Judd Apatow pulled off a something seemingly impossible: a combination of a crude, gross-out comedy and a heartfelt, tender romantic comedy. While these two sub-genres didn't mix very well with each other, glimpses of each of both have managed to be consistent throughout the entire movie. That's largely due to the likable and unbelievably relatable protagonist, Andy, brought to life by an outstanding, star-making performance by Steve Carell, who revealed his massive talent, showing an impressive range he would latter become famous for.All the secondary characters here have a reasonable depth that prove how this movie is really different from your typical gross-out comedy. They may be stereotypical after all, but the witty rude humor that came from them added an extra, and maybe interestingly contradictory, layer to all of them. I think all the performances are great, but Paul Rudd really stole the show.Also the movie features a young Jonah Hill in a very funny cameo. I mean, what more could you ask for?(7.5/10)

Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, Wedding Crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects. Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than 'Crashers'. Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrell's character Andy and Catherine Keener's character Trish will go to, it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other. And, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both.The thing is some people may go into The 40 Year Old Virgin not knowing Steve Carrell as well as Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, as Carrell has built up his cult status on The Daily Show (one of my favorite shows on now) and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty. This is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle. He and co-writer/director Judd Apatow treat the character of Andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way, even early on as he talks to his action figures while re-painting them. It's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett (also about sexual dysfunction). As the title suggests, Andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little Pee-Wee Herman in him (the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign).So, his friends (among them Paul Rudd, Romany Mancoy, Seth Rogen, all very good comic foils) try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over Andy's head to pop his cherry, so to speak. He almost gets with a overly drunk woman, he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl, and almost with his own boss (Jane Lynch, also very funny in the mockumentaries) as a (explitive) buddy. But this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with Trish, who works across the street from him. As they build on a relationship not based at all on sex, one might worry that the plot gear of "how is he going to tell her such and such" might get in the way of the comedy. It doesn't. In fact, if anything, Carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree. For practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length, there was barely a moment I wasn't laughing, whether big or small.The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, Rudd's being the funniest). The big laughs come through because of Carrell's reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth. Keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like 'Crashers', there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise). For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, Carrell gets very high points here. And like with a Farrelly brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the 'waxing' scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise). But if you're willing not to get offended by it, there's more where that came from. This is one of the funniest films of the year.

"The 40 Year Old Virgin":Judd Apatow's first time at-bat, Steve Carell's career launching pad . . . It even saved "The Office" from cancelation. That's some serious cachet, and maybe the real surprise is that (despite being so wildly 2005) it holds up so well today.Carell can't be underestimated here. He's super relatable as the guy who's never bothered with dating, and I really felt for his character when life started moving too fast. The cast has amazing chemistry and they all work together to make something that's genuinely funny (the deliveries of these jokes are incredible!). It's a legit knee-slapper.Apatow has made a career out of his raunch-with-a-heart shtick but he struck just the right balance here. The whole thing just seems to work in harmony.

I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie.Kudos to Steve Carrell(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there wasn't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer).There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical.I will definitely go see '40 Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it.

40 Year-Old Virgin, The (2005) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A geeky guy (Steve Carell) is still a virgin so his buddies try to get him laid. I went into this film expecting a one joke movie but was pleasantly shocked to see how much of a heart this thing had. The raunchy humor hit the spot but I never thought the film was cruel or mean, which would have really ruined this thing. The laughs are non-stop but the film has an incredibly big heart and best of all a rather touching ending. With this and Wedding Crashers there appears to be life for the comedy genre.

All right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside, then I was blushing on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. Whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose.I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit, but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. If I were to say, "This movie is hilarious, go check it out!" and some sweet, little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that's just something I don't need on my conscience.So how raunchy is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mom would've walked out during the first scene. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I come to expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming, "If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down," is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate.And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.Strangely enough, despite the raunch, there's an admirable moral to the story. The movie doesn't portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin. He's really portrayed as a likable, admirable character. Sure, he's a little weird. After all, he has a framed Asia poster, "more videogames than an Asian kid," and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin. As odd as it may seem, there's a bit of an "it's OK to wait" message.But man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go. That was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. If you can handle that or talk that way yourself, then you'll love the movie.I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly ladies, you might not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross, well, this gives you a good idea.There you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. Be that your guide. It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class, mama, grandmama, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.

I know this will be very unpopular, but I found this movie to be mostly unfunny, way too long, incredibly predictable, and very base. For anyone seeking humor that does not insult one's basic level of intelligence, this is not the movie for you. There ARE some hilarious scenes, but they are very brief and sandwiched in between big fat loaves of the most low-level frat/high school humor I've seen in a while. It doesn't involve you enough to really want to see what happens, also because it rambles on for about a half hour too long.I'm a big fan of humor like old Woody Allen, The Office, Spinal Tap, and Airplane!, and this just wasn't inventive enough to hold my interest. Toilet humor does not require good writing, it just requires an audience who likes toilet humor. I'm cool with people liking it, but it does nothing for me, personally. Occasionally a bit of random, absurd humor would pop in, which was good, but it was mostly relying on cheap humor tricks that got old after the first 15 minutes, for me.Also, I don't mind people swearing at all, but after a while, I actually got bored of hearing it so freaking much.Sorry, two thumbs down here.

...But FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title's Content and Context....
As SO often occurs in Hollywood, Movies are made where the main idea seems to be so good, so foolproof, that you react by saying, "Damn, what a hell of a great premise for a movie...No WAY they can screw THAT up!"Unfortunately, with Movies...As is the case with almost EVERYTHING in LIFE...where there's a will, there's a Way,! And, consequently, sometimes even the best of concepts results in a five-alarm disaster of a film... Thank God that, The 40 Year Old Virgin, is a case of "The Exception Proves the Rule!" And this, despite the fact that Universal seemed to do just about everything possible to spoil VIRGIN, it is STILL definitely worth watching, at least once!In the title role we have the comedy sensation of recent years, Steve Carell, who entered the Comedy Stratosphere with Bruce Almighty. (Where Mr. Carell was Jim Carey's TV weatherman competition...Remember that now famous scene where Carell's character is trying to break some important news, but all he can manage to get out is a series of weird grunts, groans and assorted sounds!) It seems that, Carrell, who really WAS around 40 at the time ALMIGHTY was made, attained great comic success relatively late in life...But, of course, much better late.....!One of Virgin's excesses is that every time the film reaches a rather difficult stretch, it appears that Director, Tom Shadyac (Liar, Liar) places too much responsibility on the shoulders of his leading man, who, despite his great and varied talents, sometimes can't help showing just how much of a struggle it is to carry the film forward.Another example where VIRGIN is a bit over-the-top, regards the unrelenting profanity in the dialog! If any of you non-native speakers out there were not familiar with some of these words in English, during each viewing, you'll get to practice them at least a hundred times! At some point, it just stops being funny for everyone in the audience.Also, there is simply too much information about too many sexual acts and other kinky incidentals that might have provoked laughter the first, second, or even a bit the third time, but with the umpteenth reference ends up being downright nauseating.With a runtime of nearly two hours, I think that Virgin would have been even more enjoyable with at least 5 to 10 minutes of strategic editing. But, despite the flaws mentioned here, there are a number of scenes that produce industrial-size laughter, which readily justify the time you invest watching! Also, Virgin demonstrates more than enough originality, both in general concept and in how it has been brought to the screen..It is well worth mentioning co-star, Catherine Keener (The Interpreter, Being John Malkovich), certainly, a very underrated actress in Hollywood. She plays the competition for love interest to perfection, giving the film a much needed touch of realism and credibility.So here is an interesting and fun film that will probably feel good to both men and women alike! There is almost nothing visually graphic in Virgin, but because of its non-stop hardcore locker room language, I would recommend it for those at least14 or15, in your family.No matter if you lost yours at 12 or at 40... or even if you still are...VIRGIN makes us ALL laugh about an integral component of the human condition, one with which practically each and every one of us can relate to!ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are welcome!

this is one of the funnier films i've seen. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm. it's Altmanesque screenplay, brilliant physical humour, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for Steve Carell's nipple..i truly was. surprisingly, this is a good-natured, unabashed comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way. Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish, and all of Steve Carell's friends were flawed but amiable, and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended.

''The 40 Year Old Virgin'''made me laugh a lot. I don't care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as the virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest, specially because it is real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous,by the way.Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. He is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys, but seems harmless. One day, while playing poker with his friends of his work, they discover that Andy is in fact...virgin! And he is already 40 years old! After this surprising revelation, all his friends are trying to make Andy sleep with a woman...the problem is the confusions in which Andy gets in,specially now that he is really starting to like Trish, a woman he met when she was buying a DVD player in the store he works at.

I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know  what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a  lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. What a great surprise. I  laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes. This film is a must see  for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor.  OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack  Palance?) or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are  (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find  anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet  love story. My girlfriend and I both loved it.  Steve Carell is terrific, but (like The Office) the supporting cast  really makes the film work. All of the characters have their flaws, but  they also have depth and likability. Everyone pulls their weight and  the chemistry is perfect.  I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be up there with Office  Space for replays and quotable lines.

One thing I love about Steve Carell is that he leaves a good impression in every movie he's enrolled in. His performance and expressions in "The 40 Year Old Virgin" makes the audience believe in the situation that he is dealing with. Judd Apatow's movies are known to include comedian actors such as Paul Rudd and Soth Rogen who played two amazing roles in this movie. Seeing that the movie turned out to be entertaining and well developed, I found it longer than it should have been. I think movies like "The 40 year old virgin", or "This is 40" (also directed by Judd Apatow) should be plain and simple (about 1 hr 20 min - 1 hr 30 min max). Despite the fact that the plot is amusing, it should have been compressed. Overall, it was a good movie.

"The 40 year Old Virgin" is a 2005 film that perfectly describe when and where Hollywood reached its peak, when films didn't have to worry about being politically correct, but at the same time they understand some key aspect of society, American society specially, there was inclusivity, there was some boundaries but ultimately, there was fun, it was in a few words pure entertainment.Talking specifically about the movie there are a lot of jokes that may hurt some sensibility in today society, yet they are not ill intended, and for most of people they are funny, it also has a few touchy and warm-felt moments, it talks about friendship, loneliness, love, parenthood, fear of rejection and many other sensible topics yet it doesn't never stray away from its purpose of being an irreverent comedy movie.I think this is one of the best comedy film of the last years, who can be enjoy by teenagers, young adults and adults alike.

In this comedy, quite adult, even if not for the theme, we follow the attempts of a group of co-workers to get one of their colleagues, more shy but already forty years old, to lose his virginity. It is a very simple plot, totally focused on easy comedy, sometimes quite breeder. It's not the kind of movie I recommend to watch with your mom or grandma, but it's great for a group of friends.The plot is, in fact, so basic that I fear spoiling it if I reveal more than what I said above. It is a very direct, straightforward film, where the theme of sex, and the way we look at sex, is approached without taboos or complications to, after all, prove the importance and relevance of love and how empty it can be the sex just for sex. I think that's the big message of the film.The film rests entirely on the shoulders of Steve Carell, a particularly skilled and pleasant comic actor, who seems to have real fun while playing the character. I was sorry that the film did not have, in the final credits, scenes cut or unedited with the best fails of the filming, as some comedies do. It would certainly have been a much more appealing and interesting way to end this film than that endless "Age of Aquarius" song. The film also has a good participation by Catherine Keener, but the rest of the cast is limited to supporting these two actors.Technically, it is a discreet film, which allows comedy to dominate and get our attention. Therefore, cinematography is quite routine, the sets and costumes are what you would expect, and the soundtrack is not always pleasant (I already mentioned that I didn't like the final song), but that's not bad, on the contrary, it gives space so that we can focus on what is essential: laughter and entertainment.

Andy Stitzer(Steve Carell) is a 40 year old virgin who is pushed by his friend to lose his virginity. During this crusade, Andy meets many women, but one woman named Trish(Catherine Keener) catches his eye more than the others.Steve Carell shows us to be an absolute genius. His role is perfect for him and just plain "makes" the movie. The movie exceeded all expectations I could have had. The acting was great, the writing was wonderful, and the comedy could not have been any funnier for what it was. If you have seen The Office or Anchorman you would know how Steve Carell steals the show and this movie proves it more than ever. Overall, the movie is just fantastic and is the second best comedy of the year, falling short only of Wedding Crashers.I highly recommend this movie.

Hey have you ever wanted to watch a really good flic? Well, here it is! Our little friend, Steve is so so adorable in this story! It's a pathway to genuine desire. Please wait until the end for the lesson! You'll love it. And the cast, Oh my gosh! They are magnificent, and so young :P.

I saw this movie and I terrible hated despite all the commentary, what kind of humor is? I tried to laugh but only in one part I did it.If you plan to torture yourself for almost 2 hours, this is your movie.Using just sex and women like objects is stupid , the script is boring , predictable , the actors ,except CARREL, are the worst I've seen like Tom Cruise wife on Batman.I wish they don't have plans to make second part , but in this Hollywood , where's all in continuation and the same script again and again but different actors, the remakes ( I suffer when I see how great movies are destroyed) and unnecessary FX'S all is possible.I couldn't believe the rating of 7.4. there's tons of movies that deserve 1000 in rating if this deserve more than 7.

So I just watched this for the first time. It was very funny. And it had a crazy amount of big names in it and I wasn't expecting it. And all of them do what they are for really well cause sure I kept noticing all these actors but right after they came on I started seeing them as there character. Now it's hard to write some big review on this cause it's just a simple fun comedy and I'd def recommend it. And i do not really know what to say from here other then just check it out for yourself it's a classic and I can see why but ya know it's just a classic comedy nothing crazy ya know so do it check it out.

One of the best comedies ever. I saw it in the theater 16 years ago and just got the BluRay. It's just as funny as it was originally. It's adult themed and I wouldn't suggest watching it with the young kids. But it's hilarious. From Seth Rogan recounting a visit to a Tijuana Donkey Show to Steve Carrell reminiscing about a failed encounter during his teen years where he accidentally kicked his partner in the nose. Highly recommended! It's a laugh a minute with some of the funniest guys and gals in the cast.
