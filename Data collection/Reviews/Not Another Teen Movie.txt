Not Another Teen Movie, like Scary Movie, this is a parody of what the 1990's had to offer us, the romantic teen comedies! How many of them do we loathe? But how many were also great? Not Another Teen Movie makes fun of movies from the 80's to the 90's and is very clever. I saw this movie with a friend and honestly, while there are a few parts that were a little too much for me, I don't exactly dig potty humor, but there are some really funny scenes. It was fun to see someone finally make fun of the all the clichés that were rubbed in our faces: the nerdy girl turning into the hot girl, clichéd characters that would never be friends but somehow are, the best friend in love with the other friend who's in love with the popular kid, you get the drill.In the stereotypical high school community of John Hughes High sexy Priscilla, a popular cheerleader, separates from her boyfriend, Jake Wyler. After Jake discovers that Priscilla is now dating strange and socially inept Les just to spite him, one of Jake's friends, Austin, suggests seeking retribution by making Janey Briggs, a "uniquely rebellious girl", the prom queen. Jake attempts to court Janey's love, but faces adversity from his own sister Catherine, who is sexually attracted to him, Janey's unnoticed admirer and best friend Ricky, and memories from his past football career. Catherine eventually helps her brother by slightly altering Janey's appearance, ultimately making her more attractive to the other characters. Meanwhile, Janey's little brother, Mitch, and his friends, Ox and Bruce, make a pact to lose their virginity by Graduation even though they are still in their Freshmen year. Making fun of movies like: She's All That, Cruel Intentions, American Pie, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Drive Me Crazy, American Beauty, and Pretty in Pink , Not Another Teen Movie leaves no film left alone to show us the utter cliché that came with every teen movie out of the 90's.Like I said, there are some moments that are a little much, this is a pretty raunchy comedy, but I think it's just making fun of the in your face movies with the sick humor as well. I mean there's potty humor and hard core nudity, but I digress. There are some really funny moments in this movie, wither it was the random song the cast breaks into about their excitement for the prom or the whole introduction of the clichéd characters. The cast looked like they had a blast making this movie and I had a lot of fun watching it as well. I would recommend it for those who love satire and parodies, I did warn you though about the raunchiness, so if you have a weak stomach, you may wanna fast forward through a few parts.7/10

Not Another Teen Movie is about a popular jock named Jake who takes a bet from his friend Austin, that he can turn the school's ugliest most unpopular girl, Janey into a prom queen. But as he keeps spending time with her, he starts to fall in love. I actually liked this movie. It's funny, if you don't take the movie too seriously and dwell on the fact that it has no plot. I always love to watch this movie whenever I'm especially PO'd at the world and I just need to sit back and laugh. Some of the parts are absolutely hilarious actually. I loved how the movie made fun of other movies, such as "Breakfast Club" and "Sixteen Candles". It's sort of like the "Scary Movie" movies, except maybe not as good, but still funny.

Some people will go into this movie and criticize it for being well.....stupid. But it is supposed to be. It is a parody, the whole point of this movie is to make people laugh. It is full of stupid and idiotic scenes that are there just to bring out a chuckle. If you go into the movie not expecting it to win any sort of Oscar for serious acting then you will probably be pleased with the results. It mocks many scenes from classic teen movies such as pretty in pink and breakfast club (really it pokes fun at all John Hughes movies by either referencing to them and pretty much copying exact scenes). Then it took stuff from newer movies such as She's All That, Cruel Intentions, Never Been Kissed, etc, etc. If you were a fan of the Scary Movie's line then you will enjoy this also.

I'm more of a dark humor man myself but this movie is pretty funny, I love how they don't care at all they fit 20 different plots in one movie it goes from one iconic scene to another if I were to try and recommend this to anyone I would say if you like movies that make fun of tropes this might be your movie

I'm pretty sure the name "Not Another Teen Movie" is meant ironically, since the entire film is ironic, or at least tries to be. This flick contains an absolute gaggle of d*ck jokes, so if that's what you're looking for, you're home. Occasionally, something semi-clever surfaces, like using the white dude who acts Chinese to lampoon how dumb white kids look when they try to act black. That really amused me.Other than that, it's a steady diet of low-brow humor. "NATN" contains parodies of countless teen movies from the last 20 years. Sometimes, they're actually funny, but other times, all they've done is recreate an old movie scene and hope you laugh from the nostalgia. So, if dirty jokes and half-baked send-ups leave you in stitches, you'll like this movie. If not, you won't.

While there have been countless atrocious spoof movies released over the years, this parody of themes and clichés from '80s and '90s teen flicks like 'She's All That,' 'The Breakfast Club,' and 'American Pie' is one of those rare few that are actually genuinely funny. It did a good job of stitching many iconic scenes from countless teen movies into one cohesive (and actually quite enjoyable) story. This is a comedy true and through - as long as you find slapstick parodies funny.

This movie was horrible.  The commercial made it seem alright, but the actual movie was a piece of crap.  Way too many lame jokes that don't make it any funnier.  Even a couple of key cameos and a decently acted reenactment from "The Breakfast Club" can't save this movie.  Save your money, save your time.

The days of Airplane and Naked Gun are over. Nowadays, we have the Scary Movies, Spy Hard, Date Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc....of all of these, Teen Movie is quite easily the best one. The point of spoofs and satires, to me, are not just to take familiar scenes and do something retarded and gross with them, but instead to actually make fun of all the things in the original movies that, while watching them, we all turned to our friends and said "wait a minute, thats kind of stupid". Teen Movie does this extremely well. How many of us lucky movie fans who saw She's All That had trouble seeing why everyone in the movie thought the lead actress was ugly just because she had glasses and a ponytail? She was still a babe! How many of these teen movies give the main lead actress a friend who is clearly into her, but she always seems to ignore any possibility of romance between them, instead pursuing another character and asking for her friend's help/advice? How many people thought the characters in Cruel Intentions were just sexually over the top to the point of being absurd? Teen Movie pokes great fun at all of these flaws. It is, unlike many other movies that attempt to be like it, a true satire, taking characters and not just doing stupid things with them, but exaggerating the traits of their serious counterparts and, when it comes down to it, just making fun of them. It has surprisingly good plot cohesion while still making fun of a variety of teen movies. I suppose the best way to distinguish this movie from all other modern spoofs is that this one is truly intelligent. Sure it has some stupid jokes, and toilet humor (that I admit I chuckled at in disgust like the diarrhea scene and the lesbian kiss with the old woman), but it also has some very clever jokes, like when is it appropriate to start a slow clap, why do these teen movies seem to only have one black character, and how silly is it that things slow down for emphasis when the beautiful female lead enters the room. Please, give this one a chance. If you've seen the other modern spoofs, I'm confident you will appreciate the noticeable and subtle differences between them and Teen Movie that make the latter much more enjoyable and palatable to watch.

I think a lot of the flak this movie is getting nailed with is coming from people who don't really understand what parodies are.  All in all, NATM is a decent comedy spoof.  Even the harshest critic will have to admit some scenes were hilarious and many jokes were clever.NATM has been criticized for its frequent descent into pure raunchiness, blatant sleeziness, outrageous violence, and low-brow slapstick.  To some extent, I believe this may have been an intentional slap in the face of the viewer.  This was the movie's way of saying, "See how vulgar the media that entertains you has become?  This is awful, but you will watch and you will be amused.  See how low we've come?  "Hardcore movie fans will be rewarded with a landslide of movie references and gags.  The downside is that mild movie goers will miss many of the jokes.  The overall plot primarily spoofs Pretty in Pink and She's All That. Viewers should definitely be at least vaguely familiar with those two. Other semi-important study material include: Varsity Blues, 10 Things..., Never Been Kissed, Bring It On, Breakfast Club, American Beauty, American Pie, She's all that, Can't Hardly Wait, Cruel Intentions.   If you haven't seen all those, don't sweat it;  you'll just miss a few gags here and there.There is a horde of other references.  The movie actually tries to touch base with a bit too many movies.  A few of the gags and references are almost so obscure as to be useless(Almost Famous??).  And some of the target movies were actually spoofs themselves.Another flaw is that occasionally, NATM became a bit too self-conscious, and the ending really began to drag.  Overall, it ran a bit longer than necessary.I give Not Another Teen Movie a 6 out of 10.  Go with a bunch of friends and just have a good time.

First off, let me say, I wasn't expecting an excellent movie.  I knew this wasnt "oscar-calibur".  I expected something along the lines of Scary Movie. But dear god, what were they thinking?!  This movie was so incredibly not-funny.  During the movie, there was maybe one person in the theater who was laughing.  There were more screams of "This movie sucks" than there were laughs.  I warn everyone out there, do not see this movie.  It is just flat out not funny.  The only upside is that there is a very large amount of hot chicks.  But go see Ocean's 11, or anything but this.  I can't believe we didn't see Vanilla Sky.  Not another teen movie = awful.  0 / any number possible.

I believe that perhaps a lot of the criticisms of this film come from 90's-00 teens because THEY JUST DON'T GET IT! Most of the comedy in this film spoofs 1980's movies, with a few current barbs thrown in from more recent films. I am an 80's child, and I laughed so hard during this movie! I saw it with younger kids from the mid-to-late 90's, and they didn't get half of the jokes. The school cafeteria is named "The Anthony Michael Dining Hall." The school is "John Hughes High School." There are send-ups of "Risky Business," "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," "Pretty In Pink," "Sixteen Candles," and an absolutely priceless scene that spoofs "The Breakfast Club," along with the original "Breakfast Club" principal, Richard Vernon, spouting almost exactly the same dialogue. Sure, there are much more recent films that are skewered, such as "Varsity Blues," (which was HORRIBLE) and "She's All That," (Which was EVEN WORSE.) There's an hilarious running gag spoofing "Cruel Intentions," in which the slutty sister will stop at nothing to bed her brother, high school football hero Jake Wyler, who makes a bet with his team members that he can turn plain-jain, boy-hating Janie Griggs into the prom queen. Sex jokes and excrement jokes run rampant, all hilarious. Jamie Pressly, who you might remember from Jerry Springer's movie "Ringmaster," is a total riot as head cheerleader Priscilla, who schemes to copy cheers from a rival school's all-black cheerleading squad, spoofing "Bring It On." And the siamese twins who win Homecoming Queen(s) is an absolute riot, especially when homecoming king Jake has to share a dance with them and the band sings "Put your heads on my shoulder...." TOO FUNNY! A hilarious movie, especially if you're high or drunk, and you KNOW what they are spoofing.

The jokes in this film are so forced its sad, the movies they try to spoof are such classics that its just not really funny...maybe they get a chuckle out of most, but no belly laughs...and the nudity is the only thing keeping guys in the theatre.....this film would have been funny if it had come out back in 1987..but,I dont think even then they would have made people laugh with this trash.. most of the films they spoof, breakfast club,16 candles,ferris bueller etcc, arent easy to spoof.....and arent done well here either..in short this movie sucks! and it sucks hard!!! watching this film is about as much fun as watching paint dry, and its as painful to watch as passing a kidney stone.....pass on this turd..Airplane,or even Scary Movie this isnt..

We have all seen american pie 1 and 2, road trip, can't hardly wait, election, 10 things, cruel intensions, varsity blues and so on.But the general population of the audience would not have seen she's all that, pretty in pink, and the other movies in the 70's to 80's. Besides from that this new brand of teen movie, provides laughs around every corner, and the more you watch it the more funny it is.This film completely pokes holes in classic teen movies, for example "billy bob with bacon the pig from varsity blues" is "reggie ray and sausage the pig" you get what i mean.very strong acting from Chris evans and Jaime Pressly.the reason why some people are over critical is because that these people would not of got the jokes because the lack of knowledge of teen movies.And like it says in the trailer "if you have seen scary movie, who gives a...." that is exactly right, this movie far outbeats the latest installments of teen movies by far.A definate must see for fans of teen flicks.i will give it a 8.5/10

This movie is exactly not another teen movie, in fact it's worse.  When you take all the worse teen movies, cut some scences from them, your going to get the horriblest teen movie possible.  And this movie is that.  There was a bunch of characters, all with pointless roles.  This movie is just terrible, I believe the worst of it's year.  It was a bunch of cluttered stupidity.  I was embassased just to be in the movie theater, I can't imagine how all of the actors felt.  It's bad when you'd rather keep going to the food court and buy over priced snack foods just to avoid watching the movie.

It's gross, stupid, and raunchy and I love it! And you can tell that everyone involved had a great time, and that just adds to the experience. It also helps that I am a fan of a few of the movies that they make fun of like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. And even the stuff that isn't exactly funny gets a laugh out of me because it's all over-the-top in the best way.

sad simply sad....who ever liked this movie i feel so so sorry for them.I only laughed 3 times in the movie. When you count how many times you laugh in a movie that is meant to be 'funny' then there is something seriously wrong with the movie.Yes certain parts were weird and nearly made me laugh but this movie is so geared up for the American market which has to be told in an obvious manner when to laugh during the movie.thank goodness i never saw this at the movies when it came out. It would of been a waste of my money and a waste of one and a half hours of my life.

I hate it when people make comments about these sorts of films saying that the story line is loose or vague or it has no real plot. The only reason for these films to have any sort of plot is to direct the jokes. I believe this films primary purpose is to make the viewer laugh and it does so in abundance. I went to see the film with an open mind not expecting to be blown away with a fantastic performance from the lead character or be intrigued by its deep and complex story line - its a light hearted no-brainer that does its job.I think the problem most people have with this film is they haven't seen many of the films it spoofs which in turn would make it very unfunny. However it captures the essence of all teen movies and all the characters (although supposed to be from one movie or another) can be recognised in any of the teen movies.It was always going to be a difficult task to include a good array of characters and movies to spoof but I believe director Joel Gallen has done a pretty decent job. Watch it with your mates and few beers!

I'm more of a dark humor man myself but this movie is pretty funny, I love how they don't care at all they fit 20 different plots in one movie it goes from one iconic scene to another if I were to try and recommend this to anyone I would say if you like movies that make fun of tropes this might be your movie

Please, give this one a chance. If you've seen the other modern spoofs, I'm confident you will appreciate the noticeable and subtle differences between them and Teen Movie that make the latter much more enjoyable and palatable to watch.

Let me just start by saying don't expect it to be more than what it is. It is, after all, a spoof movie. It's based on other movies of the turn of age variety. With that being said, it is exceptional in comparison to other movies in it's collective genre. It's well-directed (with the exception of a couple scenes), well shot, it's script isn't too over the top (exception of bathroom scene, which was a little too much but not enough to ruin the movie) and the story moved well throughout. Production quality was pretty standard for that time but was good considering the 15 mil budget. The real gem in this movie though is the casting...the casting for this movie was absolutely fantastic. This movie actually helped launch a few careers. Most notably Chris Evans. I gotta hand to my boy Chris, he killed it. He had great screen presence, for being a rookie in the screen acting gig, nailed like, 99% of his lines and made all the scenes with his costars better than they were without him. It should be said, without Chris Evans, this movie would have been an absolute flop. He seriously stole the movie. Also, notable mention, Mia Kirshner did extremely well also, considering the f-ed up scene material she had to work with (lol). She stole her scenes as well. Eric Christian Olson and others did well but lacked depth and came off a little one-dimensional. It's no surprise that, with the exception for the two I mentioned above, they could only find steady work on television. Though she did well in her scenes and was so unbelievably hot, I don't really see why Jaime Pressley's character was even in the story. She was absolutely inconsequential to the overall story. To give you an example, she was supposed to be the main's girlfriend but you never actually see them dating as they break up as soon as you first see them on the screen together. There's a few scenes that exist solely to spoof other movies but for the most part they tie in well with the rest. It's as entertaining as the first Scary Movie, which was the best spoof movie I've seen since Mel Brooks' Robin Hood Men in Tights and Airplane, my top two all time. Worth a watch and has good rewatch quality but not an Oscar Winner by any means. Chris Evans, Mia Kirshner and Randy Quaid, who was hilarious, make it very watchable if you're looking for a spoofer that isn't too corny. Solid 6.8ish not quite a full seven so I just rounded up. Enjoy!

First off, let me say, I wasn't expecting an excellent movie.  I knew this wasnt "oscar-calibur".  I expected something along the lines of Scary Movie. But dear god, what were they thinking?!  This movie was so incredibly not-funny.  During the movie, there was maybe one person in the theater who was laughing.  There were more screams of "This movie sucks" than there were laughs.

I can't believe we didn't see Vanilla Sky.  Not another teen movie = awful.  0 / any number possible.

The IMDb ranking for this film is quite harsh in my opinion. OK, this film was never going to win an Oscar, but it's enjoyable throughout and has some very good laughs in it. I'm not a big fan of teen movies but I saw this and was impressed. It's light-hearted and not afraid to appear ridiculous (infact most of the time it does this deliberately) and it doesn't pretend to be "Just another teen movie", indeed it IS "Not another teen movie", it's a very enjoyable laugh at the expense of those films.Don't expect your life to be changed by this film, but if you want simply a fun film to watch then you won't go far wrong seeing this one.

I think a lot of the flak this movie is getting nailed with is coming from people who don't really understand what parodies are.  All in all, NATM is a decent comedy spoof.  Even the harshest critic will have to admit some scenes were hilarious and many jokes were clever.NATM has been criticized for its frequent descent into pure raunchiness, blatant sleeziness, outrageous violence, and low-brow slapstick.  To some extent, I believe this may have been an intentional slap in the face of the viewer.  This was the movie's way of saying, "See how vulgar the media that entertains you has become?  This is awful, but you will watch and you will be amused.  See how low we've come?  "Hardcore movie fans will be rewarded with a landslide of movie references and gags.  The downside is that mild movie goers will miss many of the jokes.  The overall plot primarily spoofs Pretty in Pink and She's All That. Viewers should definitely be at least vaguely familiar with those two. Other semi-important study material include: Varsity Blues, 10 Things..., Never Been Kissed, Bring It On, Breakfast Club, American Beauty, American Pie, She's all that, Can't Hardly Wait, Cruel Intentions.   If you haven't seen all those, don't sweat it;  you'll just miss a few gags here and there.There is a horde of other references.  The movie actually tries to touch base with a bit too many movies.  A few of the gags and references are almost so obscure as to be useless(Almost Famous??).  And some of the target movies were actually spoofs themselves.Another flaw is that occasionally, NATM became a bit too self-conscious, and the ending really began to drag.  Overall, it ran a bit longer than necessary.I give Not Another Teen Movie a 6 out of 10.  Go with a bunch of friends and just have a good time.

Gross, stupid, and yawn like humor.  Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Poorly written, directed, and acted.  Material was crude, degrading, and pathetic.Avoid this movie at all costs. 1 out of 10 (because there isn't a zero)

I believe that perhaps a lot of the criticisms of this film come from 90's-00 teens because THEY JUST DON'T GET IT! Most of the comedy in this film spoofs 1980's movies, with a few current barbs thrown in from more recent films. I am an 80's child, and I laughed so hard during this movie! I saw it with younger kids from the mid-to-late 90's, and they didn't get half of the jokes. The school cafeteria is named "The Anthony Michael Dining Hall." The school is "John Hughes High School." There are send-ups of "Risky Business," "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," "Pretty In Pink," "Sixteen Candles," and an absolutely priceless scene that spoofs "The Breakfast Club," along with the original "Breakfast Club" principal, Richard Vernon, spouting almost exactly the same dialogue. Sure, there are much more recent films that are skewered, such as "Varsity Blues," (which was HORRIBLE) and "She's All That," (Which was EVEN WORSE.) There's an hilarious running gag spoofing "Cruel Intentions," in which the slutty sister will stop at nothing to bed her brother, high school football hero Jake Wyler, who makes a bet with his team members that he can turn plain-jain, boy-hating Janie Griggs into the prom queen. Sex jokes and excrement jokes run rampant, all hilarious. Jamie Pressly, who you might remember from Jerry Springer's movie "Ringmaster," is a total riot as head cheerleader Priscilla, who schemes to copy cheers from a rival school's all-black cheerleading squad, spoofing "Bring It On." And the siamese twins who win Homecoming Queen(s) is an absolute riot, especially when homecoming king Jake has to share a dance with them and the band sings "Put your heads on my shoulder...." TOO FUNNY! A hilarious movie, especially if you're high or drunk, and you KNOW what they are spoofing.

NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE will not please all viewers, and it shouldn't. If one were to like every single movie ever made, then there wouldn't be movie critics. By the way, that quote in the summary is one of the funniest lines in the movie. This movie has plenty of fun spoofing THE BREAKFAST CLUB, PRETTY IN PINK, American PIE and, the one that probably gets spoofed the most in this movie, SHE'S ALL THAT (which, by the way, wasn't all that). The party scene where the girl is walking through the house naked prompting another naked party going girl to say to her friend, "Oh my god, I can't believe she's wearing the same outfit as me." to which her friend replies, "It looks much better on you." I laugh all the time on that part. NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE is pure, no thinking involved, stupid comedy. But, like with SCARY MOVIE 3, I like this brainless stuff. If I was expecting to use my head while viewing this film, well, I must of been on something. If you haven't seen this movie, watch it!!!

The jokes in this film are so forced its sad, the movies they try to spoof are such classics that its just not really funny...maybe they get a chuckle out of most, but no belly laughs...and the nudity is the only thing keeping guys in the theatre.....this film would have been funny if it had come out back in 1987..but,I dont think even then they would have made people laugh with this trash.. most of the films they spoof, breakfast club,16 candles,ferris bueller etcc, arent easy to spoof.....and arent done well here either..in short this movie sucks! and it sucks hard!!! watching this film is about as much fun as watching paint dry, and its as painful to watch as passing a kidney stone.....pass on this turd..Airplane,or even Scary Movie this isnt..

We have all seen american pie 1 and 2, road trip, can't hardly wait, election, 10 things, cruel intensions, varsity blues and so on.But the general population of the audience would not have seen she's all that, pretty in pink, and the other movies in the 70's to 80's. Besides from that this new brand of teen movie, provides laughs around every corner, and the more you watch it the more funny it is.This film completely pokes holes in classic teen movies, for example "billy bob with bacon the pig from varsity blues" is "reggie ray and sausage the pig" you get what i mean.very strong acting from Chris evans and Jaime Pressly.the reason why some people are over critical is because that these people would not of got the jokes because the lack of knowledge of teen movies.And like it says in the trailer "if you have seen scary movie, who gives a...." that is exactly right, this movie far outbeats the latest installments of teen movies by far.A definate must see for fans of teen flicks.i will give it a 8.5/10

This movie is exactly not another teen movie, in fact it's worse.  When you take all the worse teen movies, cut some scences from them, your going to get the horriblest teen movie possible.  And this movie is that.  There was a bunch of characters, all with pointless roles.  This movie is just terrible, I believe the worst of it's year.  It was a bunch of cluttered stupidity.  I was embassased just to be in the movie theater, I can't imagine how all of the actors felt.  It's bad when you'd rather keep going to the food court and buy over priced snack foods just to avoid watching the movie.

I have to say, I didn't expect much from this film. Basically "Scary Movie" spoofing teen classics instead of horror films. I watched it and actually liked it. Yes, this film could possibly be qualified as one of the silliest movies of the decade, but that's sort of the point. This movie had laughing so hard I was gasping for breath. The humor is juvenile, but FUNNY. The plot is stupid, but HILARIOUS. It's really fun to stop and say "Hey, that 10 Things About You!" or "Oh, they're doing Can't Hardly Wait". This film is probably one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, it's not for everybody, but it's a good movie.

Not Another Teen Movie is a, uh, it might just be another teen movie, except this one is directed by Joel Gallen, one of the guys at MTV, so it is a teen movie except with that MTV humor edge to it (plus R rating).  It spoofs movie that in their own way are already funny on their own, so parodying them is not only difficult but lame.  That's why a good chunk of this movie doesn't work.  However, when Not Another Teen Movie does work its laughs, it is actually funny (the Randy Quaid scenes, Breakfast Club spoof, certain parts of the party sequence are the funniest parts.  Overall, it's OK, but it would've been funnier if it was made 5 years ago, or if I was 5 years younger.  Mr.T, Melissa Joan Hart, Molly Ringwald and Paul Gleason appear in cameos (Mr. T would've been funnier if he had better dialogue). B

Completely without value, "Not Another Teen Movie" attempts to lampoon a dozen teen-themed movies and fails miserably.  When you get more gross-out and sexual-innuendo jokes than anything, you can tell that the moviemakers are just too infantile to make a smart, clever movie.  Its not the actors fault that the movie is so horrible, its what they were asked to do in the name of cinema.  Molly Ringwald was last spotted running from the set, laughing and clutching her paycheck. I honestly laughed ONCE.  1/10.

It's gross, stupid, and raunchy and I love it! And you can tell that everyone involved had a great time, and that just adds to the experience. It also helps that I am a fan of a few of the movies that they make fun of like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. And even the stuff that isn't exactly funny gets a laugh out of me because it's all over-the-top in the best way.

By and large I'm not a big fan of spoof movies  they tend to get silly and stupid and usually have one really good laugh that is spoiled by being in the trailer (which they sort of have to do or you wouldn't go, but that's the point). I missed this one when it came out, though I really should have seen it because I'm still a sucker for a well-done teen flick. But I caught it last week on TV, when it was heavily abridged; while I thought it was funny, I wanted to see it in the way it was intended it, so I rented it and took a look.Not Another Teen Movie is absurdly funny in spots. It pokes fun of movies from the John Hughes 'classics' of the eighties up through movies like Bring It On, She's all That, Cruel Intentions, and so on. The premise is mostly stolen from She's All That: witchy cheerleader Priscilla (Jamie Pressly) dumps jock Jake (Chris Evans) and his callous (and especially stupid) friends make him a bet that he can't turn an ugly duckling into a swan. Enter Janey (Chyler Leigh), who like every girl in these movies is actually very pretty but here hides it behind glasses and a ponytail. Jake has to transform Janey into prom queen material, which he attempts to do with the help of his extremely disturbed sister Catherine (a skilled parody of Sarah Michelle Gellar from Cruel Intentions, handled well by Mia Kirshner) Along the way they encounter every stereotype from every teen film, from the horny younger brother (Bring It On's Cody McMains) to the bitchy pretty girls, to parties, the prom, the big finale, the pining best friend, and so on. Just about every cliché is touched on, some with more wit than others.The movie is also exceedingly raunchy. There's gratuitous nudity (one foreign exchange student never actually wears anything at all), a lot of swearing, and an awful lot of bathroom humor (some of it literal). There are also a number of fun cameos from a few of the actors who starred in the eighties film (the teacher from The Breakfast Club, for example), including a surprise at the end that's incredibly funny. Not Another Teen Film isn't brilliant comedy, and sometimes it tries too hard (or like in the parody of the kissing scene between Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair from Cruel Intentions, it goes way too far), but there are some really good laughs sandwiched between the raunch. The movie manages to consistently elicit chuckles, and it's certainly worth a look for those of us who grew up on these films twenty years ago or still enjoy the new crop being churned out.

sad simply sad....who ever liked this movie i feel so so sorry for them.I only laughed 3 times in the movie. When you count how many times you laugh in a movie that is meant to be 'funny' then there is something seriously wrong with the movie.Yes certain parts were weird and nearly made me laugh but this movie is so geared up for the American market which has to be told in an obvious manner when to laugh during the movie.thank goodness i never saw this at the movies when it came out. It would of been a waste of my money and a waste of one and a half hours of my life.
