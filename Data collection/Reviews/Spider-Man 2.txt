I was a kid when I watched this in cinema back in 2004
I just want to say after all these years after a few version of Spider-Mans and all the MCU movie.
This one is hands down the best Superhero movie.
It has everything done within 2 hours. Perfectly caught up what it left of from the previous Spider-Man and Toby Maguire will always be my Spider-Man.

This is a movie that surpasses the original one on many different levels! It has a better villain, a better story and, most of all, a better message. The movie is about Peter Parker who loses faith in what he does, so he loses his powers. Tobey Maguire is magnificent in this movie and he plays so well off of all the other actors in the movie. Alfred Molina is great as the villain and, as always, J.K. Simmons steal every single scene in which he is present. This is really one of the best superhero movies that has ever been made.

Spider-man was my favorite comics character. I did not care for the first movie--which missed many opportunities by not staying more faithful to the spirit of the comics from the early 60s,  instead trying to meld with the post-Mary Jane marriage era comics from the late 80s--and adding a soap opera 'forever love" aspect that was far hokier than anything I had ever read in the comics. Unfortunately, Spider-man 2 continues to display the same problems.Maguire and Dunst are still ill-suited for their roles. It was more obvious this time around. Parker should not be so whiney--and Spider-man should be more witty--taunting villains at every turn. Where's the fun? Yes, Parker has a bad personal life--but that should at least have been balanced by the joy he has being Spider-man, swinging through the city and catching bad guys. All this is still absent in chapter 2. Maybe if Maguire had better dialogue to work with--but I am not so sure. He has this buggy eyed look that makes it difficult to buy into his plight. I fear its a charisma issue--and he--but especially Dunst, don't have it--especially for this type of story.Perhaps the filmmakers were concerned that they needed to make the film appeal to every demographic--every generation of spider-fan, but focusing so much on Mary Jane--her career, her love life, was, I thought,  a great misuse of time. Perhaps they should have called the movie Mary-Jane. And for the middle section of the movie he wasn't Spider-man at all--and when he dons the costume again--he keeps taking his mask off(this was a particularly bad decision during the train sequence). Mild spoiler***The idea of him having second thoughts about being Spider-man wasn't bad--I could even tolerate the "Raindrops" song though I had to keep from thinking I was watching a 1970s coming of age movie--but it was sloppily handled. A similar thing occurred in the early comics--where Parker,  out of illness, frustration and worry loses his powers--but when he comes back--the excitment and energy is palpable. In  a movie--it should have been even more so. Alas no.
**end of spoiler
Molina's Doc Ock. Never a favorite Spider-man villain for me. I imagined a European-accented voice, menacing and stern. The scene where he advises Parker to use poetry to woo...Mary Jane--really dulled the edge. The whole energy weapon subplot was lost amid the soap opera, and rather boring to begin with. X-men 2 was a far better sequel and blending of drama and action within a comic book framework.

This movie it's not just a good superhero movie, but a great film. The source material has been analyzed, and overall studied so It would make the fans happy, but a great superhero movie understands that this is not just for the fans, It's for the whole public, so the screenplay and the dialogue that sometimes sounds a little corny is very well writen. The CGI effects still looking good at this point, watching Spider-Man swinging around it's just amazing. Peter Parker's story arc it's perfect, for the people he interacts with he is just another nerdy guy who doesn't understands the meaning of puntcuality, but for us (the audience) he is the perfect protagonist. This movie is made by someone who understands the character and undertsands about cinema, and that man is Sam Raimi.

This by far one of Sony's best work om the character of Spider-Man alongside Spider-Verse. A great interpretation of Spider-Man. It is a film that focuses on what matters. The character. Sam Raimi took everything that worked about the first Spider-Man movie and made it so much better. We see a Peter Parker with relatable problems. We see a man that never loses his will and never gives up ACTUALLY give up. He literally can't catch a break. And when he does catch a break and has his confidence boosted it feels so satisfying. This Peter Parker is probably one of the best if not the best character in the whole CB Genre. Doctor Octavius is man which Peter idolizes not only on his work in making the world a better place but also in his love life. Think about it Otto and his wife are a shadow reflection of what Peter wants. When Otto's wife dies and Otto goes insane all he wants is to rebuild the machine that made him proud, that made his wife proud. Harry's development in this movie is completely amazing he goes from being a best friend to absolutely hating Peter and being completely broken from the loss of his father who he so much wanted to impress. Bravo Sony. Bravo Sam. Thank you for giving us this masterpiece. Thank you for giving your soul into making this movie amazing. Thank you for making our childhood and adulthood amazing with this classic.

I have to be honest and state I'm not a fan of the super-hero type of movie but I did enjoy reading the Spiderman comics as a kid and if I had to state " favourite super-hero ?" Spiderman would get my vote . You know what to expect with this type of cinema adaptation , lots of set pieces , noise and special FX but Sam Raimi is a very talented director and his A SIMPLE PLAN is one of the most underrated thrillers ever made so in theory he should be able to make an entertaining big budget movie Is SPIDERMAN 2 entertaining ? Certainly yes . It's a film trying to mix budget FX work with quieter human moments . In truth the director isn't entirely successful by mixing the two elements . When the story concentrates on Peter Parker you're often reminded of Clark Kent losing his super powers in SUPERMAN 2 as heroic super dooper hero becomes a sappy wimpy mere mortal . These attempts at human elements are somewhat insipid and boring you wish you're seeing more of Doctor Octopus And this is where the film works tremendously . Alfred Molina as Dr Otto Octavuis / Doc Ock sets the screen alight . He's more than just a comic book villain he does strive to make his super-villain more than just a comic book baddie and the scenes where he realises the tentacles are controlling the man rather than the other way round are both touching and haunting . Some die hard fans will complain that Molina doesn't have the physique to be playing this type of bad guy or isn't wearing a wearing a green suit but such anorakish complaints don't deserve to heard . Not even Danny Elfman's intrusive score can spoil Molina's screen time as Doctor Octopus

The first and third 'Spider-Man' movies were simply fantastic.But it gets even better with 'Spider-Man 2'. It's full of action, has plenty of adventure, and is full of award winning special effects.Like any other super hero sequel, there's always a new villain.The villains name in 'Spider-Man 2' is Dr. Octopus.AKA Doc Ock.He has 4 mechanical tentacles that can flip cars and throw people at great distances.Does he remind you of anything? Of course he does.What does he remind you of? An Octopus... Duh.It may sound kind of stupid, but Doc Ock's character actually helps the movie become a 2 hour roller-coaster ride of a movie.Just remember that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can.

Most of the time when a film is hugely popular, I end up agreeing with the majority, especially when it's an action/scifi flick. With both "Spiderman" movies, I've disagreed. Perhaps I'm simply too much of a nerd to appreciate the very human spin Spiderman has been given by Maguire, though I should venture to say I've never collected comic books, and my familiarity with this particular series is limited to the old Fox Saturday morning cartoons (remember the days when those were something to look forward to?). I'm sorry, but I don't sympathize with the saintlike, penniless genius who's going through a major crisis and responds in a manner that suggests he's quite in touch with his feminine side. Not to imply anything about his sexuality, of course, but I'm an adherent to old-school macho stoicism, and Peter Parker does not display it, despite pursuing a "great power brings great responsibility" lifestyle. How about the responsibility not to become an emotional wreck? I guess being a superhero is hard on the wallet, but I'm sure there's a way he could make things work without breaking any laws. I don't recall his financial situation being quite so dire in the cartoon, and if it is indeed an affectation of this particular rendering, it is an unnecessary one.Maguire's attempts were somehow more acceptable in Spiderman (1) when he was a full-scale high school geek. Now that he's a superhero, I have trouble forgiving the unterminable stupid look on his face. Additionally, Kirsten Dunst doesn't make me think of MJ Watson, or a community heartthrob.The comic book story of the movie takes up half its total showing time at most, and is fairly simple and formulaic. Scientist loses sight of his original philanthropic intentions and commits dire offenses in the name of progress. The film fails to explain why Octavian's AI tentacles have so much stock in the success of his project. I realize they think, but why should they *care*?The quality of the film, ignoring the genre it's in, is certainly less than most give it. Iffy CGI, an inability to decide exactly what sort of movie it is, comedy/romance/action/drama? leads to unbalanced distribution of time for its scenes. It has a poor ending, as well, suffering from the more forgivable LOTR 3's multiple fades as all the loose ends are tied up. Still, let me be positive for a moment, after all, I rated it a 6. The acting is good, the action well-choreographed, and the drama occasionally moving, and it scores on most of its comic notes, even if Spiderman hits the bottom of an alley a few too many times.

Sequels are very tricky. They're very hard to crack open, but every so often we do get a sequel that is better than the original like Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, and others. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. The common thing among mostly all sequels is that bigger is better, that's not always the case, and that's where director Sam Raimi comes in, he does the opposite. He makes it smaller, more personal, but with big impactful moments. Here we see a damaged Peter Parker, still full of guilt with the death of Uncle Ben, he's getting fired all the time and late to school because he's busy protecting New York as Spider-Man. His relationship between Harry and Mary Jane are deteriorating as he keeps disappointing them. In the end, he gives up his duties as Spider-Man, only to return to action when Doctor Octopus is threatening the city. This movie in many ways is a coming of age story for Peter Parker. With a moving romantic subplot, Peter learns to accept his responsibilities as Spider-Man in the long run, and puts that first above all his desires including Mary Jane, and he also finds closure by telling Aunt May the truth about what happened on the night of Uncle Ben's murder. Tobey Maguire brings much depth and complexity to Peter Parker. A very fine performance by him showcasing the right amount of emotion in every single scene. Alfred Molina is excellent here as Dr. Otto Octavius, also known as Doctor Octopus, whom Peter deems as his idol in the beginning of the film. What makes him such as awesome and likable villain, is that film allows you to like him from the beginning, and to see his downfall to villainy, then to a redeemable hero at the end makes an engaging story. Give credit to Raimi and his writing team, as they provide Doc Ock much needed flare. Kirsten Dunst here is pretty good as Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane also get a lot time bickering at each other here. It's a very complicated and complex romance as she wants Peter and Peter wants her, but he can't cause of his duties as a crime-fighter. James Franco is great playing the a-hole friend. As an audience member it's very sad to see their friendship deteriorate as Harry questions Peter's loyalty to him or to Spider-Man. The action serves the story here, it seamlessly transitions to action set pieces while still serving the narrative. Not to mention they are awesome. All the fights between Spidey and Doc Ock are an adrenaline rush, particularly the subway train fight. But with that being said, if you took out all the action sequences in this movie, you still have a very intriguing and moving story to watch. That's how good this film is. Raimi and his crew of filmmakers did a tremendous job with Spider-Man 2. There are real human moments in this film, one of them involves Spidey and a group of civilians in the train. A real nice, tender, and human scene. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May even has a substantial role in the film as Peter's moral compass and she also has an action sequence in the middle of the film. J.K. Simmons is even better as J. Jonah Jameson this time around and has the film's funniest moments. Everything in this film clicks on all cylinders. The music by Danny Elfman is better than ever, and also provides the film with lots of tender scores. The visual effects are better, Spidey's web-swinging abilities are better, the romance is better, the action is better, the sound mixing and editing is better, the story, the acting, just everything. It's pretty much a perfect film. I for one thought it deserved just a little bit more from the Academy Awards other than winning the well deserved special effects award. 10/10

Spider-Man was almost the perfect comic book movie and perhaps released at the best time. When audiences get bored with what genres normally cook up (mostly horror) we the viewers always look for the next best thing. For a while, horror movies were all the fad, but these movies can become boring extremely fast and Hollywood must find something completely opposite from horror to try and keep our attention. So, what might be completely opposite from horror? Well first, lets make a list of what is opposite from horror. Happy is one, action is another; good guys always winning might be another. So, what might be a good opposite for horror is a comic book movie. Now, a lot of money comes from what Hollywood had to offer for comic book movies. Some are failures (Electra) and others are hits. For the most part, most of them are hits. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. We begin with Peter Parker continuing his job as Spider-Man, but all is not well. Peter's friend, Harry Osborn, hates Spider-Man and wants him dead. Because of Peter's relation with taking photographs of Spider-Man, Harry has problems with Peter that only continue to grow worse as the movie goes on. The main villain of this movie is Dr. Otto Octavius who later becomes Dr. Ock. In a freak accident, he is connected to his invention of arms that are suppose to help him with an even bigger invention. His wife is killed in the process and the arms attached to him seem to have complete control of what he does. Deeply grieved, Dr. Ock runs away and hides, but not for long. He comes to terms with what he has become and starts his life as super villain. As usual, it is up to Spider-Man to save the day, but something is not right. Spider-Man seems to be losing his powers and has no control of what is happening to him. It is true that this film is better than the first entry, but only by a little bit. It seems though, that scene were Peter saves the people a train was little over it when everyone on the train discovers he is Spider-Man. Overall: A- -Ben Russell

Inspired by the recent news about Tobey's likely return to playing the web-slinger in the MCU's Spider-Man 3, I rewatched this film. An IMDb score of 7.3 for this film is one of the biggest injustices I've seen on this website. In my opinion this is THE definitive and THE best superhero film of all time.This trilogy of films is my childhood. I've loved Spider-Man as long as I can remember and he has always been my favourite superhero. These films came out at just the right time when I was growing up so watching this films just brings it all back. And that's not to say my judgement of this film is blinded by nostalgia- this is genuinely an amazing film that holds up in the present day.The story is an interesting one, with Peter grappling with the personal consequences of being Spider-Man and feeling the subsequent effects, all whilst he fights the best Spider-Man villain ever to be put on screen, Alfred Molina's brilliantly menacing Doc Ock. The sequence in which Spider-Man returns and fights Doc Ock on the train is for me, the best superhero fight scene of all time and my favourite cinematic sequence ever. You can feel every punch, every wince and every scream- something that unfortunately, today's comic book flicks are devoid of.And it's not just all action and no heart- when it wants to tug on the heart strings it yanks them. The scene with Uncle Ben is so painful, raw and acted to perfection. It makes me tear up every time. There's also the usual Raimi campiness, with quips and funny moments giving the film a real charm about it. All of this is underlined by Danny Elfman's brilliant, bombastic and booming score that really does sound like the audio equivalent of a comic book.This film is a 120 minute thrill ride with heart-stopping action and heart-wrenching drama. The best superhero film ever made and my favourite film of all time.

Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 outstrips its predecessor and has a perversity and quick-wittedness that hardly seem to belong in a comic-book movie. Tobey Maguire is a good choice for the title role, since his faraway look and sleepy voice seem rather more l'uomo vague than dynamic crimebuster. Alfred Molina makes for a much better supervillain than the first movie's Green Goblin. There is something weightless and flimsy in the spectacle of Spider-Man swinging between scrapers. The cinematographer, Bill Pope, finesse a crisply shot New York with comic-book overlay.

Seems everybody LOVES this movie.  Even those I know who have good taste in movies say the LOVE it.Me?  I LIKED it.  I certainly didn't LOVE it.Naturally, the effects and much of the acting were outstanding.  This was to be expected in a movie with this budget and which had the impressive start which it did.Where it fell short was the STORY.  "WHAT", you say?  You thought the story was great?  Well, I will give it the fact that the story THEMES were in place.  The overall elements and directions of the story were worthwhile. However I felt when this story went from outline to a draft, it lost something.Everything, especially the characters, was 2-D.  Flat.  Unbelievable.  There were a number of points where it LOOKED like high drama; where one WISHED one could empathize with the characters.  However I could not, because these characters never came to life for me any more than wooden automatons.  It's as if the characters were thought of in terms of the coarse, archetypal way in which they would behave as opposed to with the refinement for the realism of human thought and behaviour.True, most movies are like this.  But this movie took some of these elements and overdramatized them.  They went over the top and thus out of the realm of believability.  Also part of why I noticed it so much in this movie is the POTENTIAL it had for being better.  Many of the actors, especially Tobey, were quite strong and capable of more.  Their own strengths made it more evident how shallowly the characters were developed.Peter Parker was entirely to "sappy" in this movie.  Not because of Tobey's portrayal, but because much of the movie focused upon him as a sympathetic character.  The problem here is that a few "hard knocks" can make for a sympathetic character.  Too many becomes surrealistic and downright comedic. Yet this movie was not meant to be padodic!What happend with Spidey's powers in this movie was nonsensical.  'Nuff said.Still, this movie had the visual effects and good action you would expect. It would be worth seeing just for the action scenes between Spidey and Doc Oc.  There were some funny moments (in fact, I wish there were MORE of them; this movie would have been more effective with a more comedic feel and less serious drama).All in all, I'm looking forward to the next installment of Spidey.  I only hope the writers can treat their characters more as living beings and less as 2-D archetypes.

I guess I expected more.  This is a film for kids, I guess.  Given all the destruction and violence they encounter on TV and in video games, CGIs are just part of kid culture.  They expect it and tolerate it.  The bringing of comics to screen is hardly new and began back in the 30s and 40s.  Back then, the limits were imagination of the goofy directors who were able to patchwork props together to suggest the special effects.  Then, there were the old superman films with George Reeves which combined both...and they were pretty cheesey.  But, underlying all of this was the comic book heroes themselves.  Comic books were the epitome of the mythic journey where clear lines stood between the bad guys and the good guys.  You always knew who the villains were, just like in the cowboy movies.  They were invariably decked out in some symbolic feature like a tight-fitting costume, with the genitalia tastefully tucked away, which displayed the sleek, muscle-rippled bodies, all of which spelled out H-E-R-O.So, why does this film fall so flat?  It's got all the gimmicks, costumes, tension, unfairness, bad-guys who are basically good but taken over by some force they could not anticipate.  The brilliant scientist turned evil by his lack of foresight...the underlying message being, there are some secrets of nature, thou shalt not mess with.  Alas, the message is an anti-intellectual one and one that detracts from the power of the mythic struggle between good and evil.  It seemed to work well in the first film but the message in this is worn thin in this rehash.  There is a lack of continuity and the struggle of Peter Parker, which should be the struggle of every one, becomes a parody.  He gets knocked down, he gets stepped on, he gets slapped, he begins to lose his powers and descends into hell and is reborn. 
Those are powerful metaphors but they come across like a tune played on an old coffee can.  All we're left with is Peter Parker's confusion, growing self-doubts and final commitment, undermined by the girl he loves.  The sacrifice is made by the villain, Al Molina who refuses to "die a monster." We're left with the feeling there's still some good in the worst of us misguided souls.So, what's the lesson here?  Is Peter Parker willing to make that supreme sacrifice of love, career and normalcy, only to have it undermined by a now-understanding, woman who comes to him in the wedding dress she was wearing for another man, whom she ungenerously left at the altar?Stay tuned, as the James Dean-lookalike is waiting in the wings to don his father's garb for the next big money maker...while the suits like up to sell lots and oodles of Spidey goodies, games and treats.Could be, but maybe I'll pass the next one...I get the feeling I've seen it all before.

I recently delved into a spree of superhero movies, but amidst the modern glitz, I felt it was time to revisit a true classic - Spider-Man 2. The movie presents a timeless story with solid tent poles and a strong focus on character development.Upon rewatching, I found myself enthralled once again, appreciating its ability to be repeatedly enjoyed. The visuals, though impressive in their time, might not stand up as strongly in the year 2023. Nonetheless, they still manage to convey the essence of the narrative effectively.While the antagonist could have been portrayed with greater strength, the character's development and writing were commendable, adding depth to the plot. However, it is the protagonist, Peter Parker, who steals the show with his compelling performance, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.In conclusion, Spider-Man 2 remains an awesome classic that stands the test of time. Despite minor visual limitations, the film's engaging story and well-crafted characters ensure you won't be bored, making it a worthy watch for both fans of the superhero genre and newcomers alike.

It only happens very rarely that a sequel surpasses the original (Terminator 2, Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) and after the relative disappointment that was the original my expectations for the second film in the series had decreased. When I finally did sit down in the cinema to see this film I was a bit anxious. But my anxiety was quickly put to rest because Spider-Man 2 took the premises from the first film and improved upon them all. The first Spider-Man film a well meaning picture but quite as good as it could have been the second film is a good film for both hardcore fans like myself and the broader audience.First off, the acting in the second film has improved tremendously. Tobey Maguire feels more right in the second film. I found him quite shallow in the first film but in the second one he seems to have developed more depth. More nuances have found their way into his acting in the second film making the character more believable and less of a square. Kirsten Dunst is never a good actress but I found her a little less annoying in this film than in the first and therefore I felt I could tolerate her presence. James Franco is decent but still has a problem with portraying nuances which basically means that in order for his performance to work he has exaggerate every emotion his character feels. As it is with most superhero movies the villain is the most interesting character and Sam Raimi couldn't have picked a better actor than Alfred Molina to play Otto Octavius aka Doc Ock. I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe but I didn't like his performance in the first Spider-Man film very much and therefore I was delighted when Alfred Molina turned out to be a far better villain than Willem was. His performance was both menacing and nuanced and even though the character isn't always directly in control of his actions (making him somewhat misinterpreted) Molina's performance makes the character highly credible and undoubtedly the most interesting character in the film.The effects have improved which is logical considering that it has been 2 years since the first film hit the cinemas. Also I found that Doc Ock was much better suited for flashy moves and cool fights than Green Goblin ever was so in that aspect the film is far superior to the first film as well. Especially the train fight will, I think, go into history as one of the best hero/villain showdowns in history if not the best. The computer effects have become slightly more subtle making the film seem more polished. There were still a few unfortunate scenes were the CGI was pretty obvious but overall the effects have improved dramatically and received a well earned Oscar.The musical score continues in the same epic fashion from the first and Danny Elfman does an exceptional job as usual. The score is both thrilling and epic but it is also subtle when it has to be and that aspect of the score works wonderfully as well. Elfman has some experience in super hero scoring (having done both Batman and Hulk aside from Spider-Man) and it shows as the score is very appropriate and fitting. Two thumbs up on the music.In terms of story telling the second film is also far better than the first. I found the first film to be very unoriginal in terms of its story. Anyone who has just an ounce of knowledge into the myth of Spider-Man knows the story beforehand and thus the film becomes very predictable and boring quite frankly. The second film did not have this problem. It was a breath of fresh air. The story seems to flow more from the heart this time around. Raimi proved in the first film that he could take a situation from the comics and translate it reasonably to the screen. In the second film he proves that he can make a highly original story as well and make it entertaining. It should also be added that Spider-Man 2 has a lot more of the humor like the kind that appears in the comics. J.K. Simmons who was one of the elements in the first film returns in his role and he is absolutely hilarious. He truly embodies the spirit of J. Jonah Jameson. There is also a very funny elevator scene which should be mentioned.Some people complained that Raimi has turned mainstream with the Spider-Man films. That is a load of rubbish and Raimi proves it by adding some elements from his cult films, the Evil Dead series. He even lets Bruce Campbell tell Spider-Man off as if to symbolize that he hasn't forgotten where he came from.All in all Spider-Man 2 surpasses the first film in the franchise in almost every way imaginable Spider-Man 2 is twice as engaging, entertaining and heartfelt than the first film in the series.9/10

Sam Raimi greatly improves on his previous ­SPIDER-MAN flick, investing this one with twice the excitement, drama, and character tension. It feels like he was playing by the rules with the first movie – following the studio's plans, never stepping out of line. Here we see the artist at work, delivering some great moments of cinema. There's even reference to Raimi's earlier horror career with buzzing chainsaws and severed limbs in the tense, quirky hospital showdown.The film retains the look, feel and sound of the first, and there's a strong sense of continuity with the return of literally ALL the characters (even Willem Dafoe makes a welcome cameo appearance as the Green Goblin). The love story, which felt a bit false in the first, is rampant here, with runaway emotion and non-stop romantic interludes, and also there is plenty of comedy to savour, dealing with Peter Parker's real-life chores being Spider-Man; i.e. his costume running in the wash and ruining the other clothes, etc. etc. It's very funny and is helped by loads of cool cameos – Bruce Campbell is back and better than before as the 'Snooty Usher', Ted Raimi is present, and of course there's J. K. Simmons, whose overbearing newspaper editor nearly steals the film.Maguire and Dunst seem more assured and in touch with their characters here, and Alfred Molina is an imposing but surprisingly human baddie. Every major character is fleshed out and concentrated on, no cardboard cut-outs or stereotypes to be seen. There are many twists and surprises before the end and although this is a lengthy film, it never outstays its welcome. The best parts are undoubtedly the action sequences, which take CGI effects to new heights (literally).The shots of Spider-Man swinging through the air are, as many have said, much more convincing and realistic than before, and the various battles with Doc Ock are outrageously exciting and crowd-pleasing. My favourite moment is undoubtedly the clash on the speeding train at the end of the movie, which is flawless cinema, original and artistic, perfectly conceived, and the winning element at this film's heart is Raimi's confidence at the helm this time. Things never become boring and this seems to be a film you can watch over and over. I'm left eagerly awaiting the third in the series.

7.3/10? Seriously? Most mediocre MCU films get a better rating than that. This movie is up there with The Dark Knight as one of the best superhero movies. This movie was loved when it came out, now it's cool to hate on the trilogy. Spider-Man 2 improved on all aspects of Spider-Man 1. Peter is struggling to be Spider-Man, and the movie illustrates that very well. The action is better than lots of movies today, most notably the train fight scene. Danny Elfman provides an unforgettable soundtrack. This movie and the trilogy shouldn't be overlooked as some cheesy 2000s movies, because they paved the way for the MCU as we know it today.

I was a kid when I watched this in cinema back in 2004
I just want to say after all these years after a few version of Spider-Mans and all the MCU movie.
This one is hands down the best Superhero movie.
It has everything done within 2 hours. Perfectly caught up what it left of from the previous Spider-Man and Toby Maguire will always be my Spider-Man.

This is a movie that surpasses the original one on many different levels! It has a better villain, a better story and, most of all, a better message. The movie is about Peter Parker who loses faith in what he does, so he loses his powers. Tobey Maguire is magnificent in this movie and he plays so well off of all the other actors in the movie. Alfred Molina is great as the villain and, as always, J.K. Simmons steal every single scene in which he is present. This is really one of the best superhero movies that has ever been made.

This movie it's not just a good superhero movie, but a great film. The source material has been analyzed, and overall studied so It would make the fans happy, but a great superhero movie understands that this is not just for the fans, It's for the whole public, so the screenplay and the dialogue that sometimes sounds a little corny is very well writen. The CGI effects still looking good at this point, watching Spider-Man swinging around it's just amazing. Peter Parker's story arc it's perfect, for the people he interacts with he is just another nerdy guy who doesn't understands the meaning of puntcuality, but for us (the audience) he is the perfect protagonist. This movie is made by someone who understands the character and undertsands about cinema, and that man is Sam Raimi.

Most of the time when a film is hugely popular, I end up agreeing with the majority, especially when it's an action/scifi flick. With both "Spiderman" movies, I've disagreed. Perhaps I'm simply too much of a nerd to appreciate the very human spin Spiderman has been given by Maguire, though I should venture to say I've never collected comic books, and my familiarity with this particular series is limited to the old Fox Saturday morning cartoons (remember the days when those were something to look forward to?). I'm sorry, but I don't sympathize with the saintlike, penniless genius who's going through a major crisis and responds in a manner that suggests he's quite in touch with his feminine side. Not to imply anything about his sexuality, of course, but I'm an adherent to old-school macho stoicism, and Peter Parker does not display it, despite pursuing a "great power brings great responsibility" lifestyle. How about the responsibility not to become an emotional wreck? I guess being a superhero is hard on the wallet, but I'm sure there's a way he could make things work without breaking any laws. I don't recall his financial situation being quite so dire in the cartoon, and if it is indeed an affectation of this particular rendering, it is an unnecessary one.Maguire's attempts were somehow more acceptable in Spiderman (1) when he was a full-scale high school geek. Now that he's a superhero, I have trouble forgiving the unterminable stupid look on his face. Additionally, Kirsten Dunst doesn't make me think of MJ Watson, or a community heartthrob.The comic book story of the movie takes up half its total showing time at most, and is fairly simple and formulaic. Scientist loses sight of his original philanthropic intentions and commits dire offenses in the name of progress. The film fails to explain why Octavian's AI tentacles have so much stock in the success of his project. I realize they think, but why should they *care*?The quality of the film, ignoring the genre it's in, is certainly less than most give it. Iffy CGI, an inability to decide exactly what sort of movie it is, comedy/romance/action/drama? leads to unbalanced distribution of time for its scenes. It has a poor ending, as well, suffering from the more forgivable LOTR 3's multiple fades as all the loose ends are tied up. Still, let me be positive for a moment, after all, I rated it a 6. The acting is good, the action well-choreographed, and the drama occasionally moving, and it scores on most of its comic notes, even if Spiderman hits the bottom of an alley a few too many times.

This by far one of Sony's best work om the character of Spider-Man alongside Spider-Verse. A great interpretation of Spider-Man. It is a film that focuses on what matters. The character. Sam Raimi took everything that worked about the first Spider-Man movie and made it so much better. We see a Peter Parker with relatable problems. We see a man that never loses his will and never gives up ACTUALLY give up. He literally can't catch a break. And when he does catch a break and has his confidence boosted it feels so satisfying. This Peter Parker is probably one of the best if not the best character in the whole CB Genre. Doctor Octavius is man which Peter idolizes not only on his work in making the world a better place but also in his love life. Think about it Otto and his wife are a shadow reflection of what Peter wants. When Otto's wife dies and Otto goes insane all he wants is to rebuild the machine that made him proud, that made his wife proud. Harry's development in this movie is completely amazing he goes from being a best friend to absolutely hating Peter and being completely broken from the loss of his father who he so much wanted to impress. Bravo Sony. Bravo Sam. Thank you for giving us this masterpiece. Thank you for giving your soul into making this movie amazing. Thank you for making our childhood and adulthood amazing with this classic.

Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 outstrips its predecessor and has a perversity and quick-wittedness that hardly seem to belong in a comic-book movie. Tobey Maguire is a good choice for the title role, since his faraway look and sleepy voice seem rather more l'uomo vague than dynamic crimebuster. Alfred Molina makes for a much better supervillain than the first movie's Green Goblin. There is something weightless and flimsy in the spectacle of Spider-Man swinging between scrapers. The cinematographer, Bill Pope, finesse a crisply shot New York with comic-book overlay.

The first and third 'Spider-Man' movies were simply fantastic.But it gets even better with 'Spider-Man 2'. It's full of action, has plenty of adventure, and is full of award winning special effects.Like any other super hero sequel, there's always a new villain.The villains name in 'Spider-Man 2' is Dr. Octopus.AKA Doc Ock.He has 4 mechanical tentacles that can flip cars and throw people at great distances.Does he remind you of anything? Of course he does.What does he remind you of? An Octopus... Duh.It may sound kind of stupid, but Doc Ock's character actually helps the movie become a 2 hour roller-coaster ride of a movie.Just remember that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can.

This has got to be the most overrated movie of the summer. Not that it's a bad movie, but the critics just seem to be hailing it as the best comic book movie of all time, and quite frankly, it isn't.This movie is like the LA Lakers, and the Shaq and Kobe are Doc Ock and his Arms. The third major force, Phil Jackson, is like J. Jonah Jameson. Without these three, this would be a terrible movie. It brings nothing new to the table, with the exception of Doc Ock. I kept trying to remember awesome scenes from it that DON'T involve Doc Ock, and there aren't any. There isn't enough of him, though. The rest of the movie is a rehash of all the themes touched on in the first one. A movie about the tough decisions of Peter Parker: whether he can exist as both Peter and Spiderman, the pitfalls of being a hero the world underappreciates, and the bitter truth that he can never have Mary Jane, lest his foes harm her. I liked this movie better the first time I saw it, when it was called Spiderman 1. Roger Ebert slammed Shrek 2 for "saying nothing original." Apparently by the time he wrote his 4 star review for Spidey, he lost interest in the importance of novelty.How many times do we have to watch Tobey Maguire gazing into a mirror as if yet another Uncle has died? How many times do we have to watch MJ react to petty accidents as if her life has been destroyed? How many times must we hear the same old sappy Heroes and Virtue monologue from the old woman? I put up with it the first time, but it got too old. With Doc Ock the movie is good. Not great. Not even as good as the first. But you have to have meat, and without Ock, this movie is the most boring rehash comic book movie I've ever seen. 6/10

I honestly feel that I must have seen a different movie than the one critics and audiences are eating up by the spoonful. The flick I saw had horrible dialogue - lows including the Henry needs a hero speech, every time Harry Osbourne spoke to himself about his hatred for Spiderman, Molina's nonsensical fusion speech... the list goes on forever - also the action was largely uninspired and overly CG, the Villain's plot super lame(he's going to destroy the city because he is a incompetent scientist and can't get his experiment right?) and worst of all, the picture was plain boring.I had high hopes for the film as I loved the first one and Raimi appeared to be shrewdly stealing the plot from Superman 2 (a great sequel), but in the end, the movie turned out flat and uninspired. Spiderman, like Superman, should be the fun, light-hearted superhero movie where you jump out of your seat to cheer for the hero. Aside from the "Go get 'em, tiger" line at the end, I never once felt like cheering for our hero.

Spiderman 2 is the best Spiderman movie. To me it feels more like a movie about Peter's struggles of being Spiderman. This was the movie which cemented my love for the character.The cast is great again. Especially Peter and Harry, which are both much better. However MJ is more of the same being a damsel in distress.Throughout the movie Peter sees the consequences of being Spiderman. His life is literally falling apart. Everyone is moving on and he's stuck because he has to be Spiderman. He loses his job, he's failing his classes in University, MJ is getting married, Aunt May is moving out, he's struggling to pay rent, while J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) is dragging SpiderMan's name in the mud. Everything is going wrong for Peter and you can't help but feel bad for him. He's such a nice guy, and he's going above and beyond to help others, but no one is helping back. This is the first CBM to truly show the struggles of being a Hero. This movie shows Peter at his lowest.In this movie we see him tell Aunt May he "caused" Uncle Ben's death, and Aunt May kicks him out. Just WOW, his life just went downhill.Sometimes the movie is a bit goofy the way it shows his misfortune, but it works because it's played out in a surprisingly hilarious way. It uses comedy to lighten up the movie. He even starts to lose his powers.Later in the story we get introduced to Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) who was great. He's creating a sustainable fusion power reactor, and he made 4 bionic arms which are impervious to heat and magnetism and are needed for the reactor. He teams up with Oscorp for funding, and With the help of Harry, Peter is able to write his paper on Otto. Peter and Otto hit it off with both being "brilliant" and we meet his wife. He explains why he is doing this with a great line very similar to "With great power comes great responsibility" line. "Intelligence is not a privilege, it's a gift, to be used for the good of mankind." This instantly shows the parallels between Peter and Otto and shows his motivations. When Otto finally tests out the reactor it unfortunately becomes unstable. Instead of stopping the reactor, Otto believes it will work. However the reactor kills his wife and damages the neural inhibitor chip in his spine, which doesn't let the AI from the arms influence his own brain. He's brought to a hospital while he's knocked out, in a great scene which shows Sam Raimi's horror roots. The arms take over and start brutally murdering the doctors. Oscorp is left bankrupt. Now we have the birth of our villain.After everything going wrong Peter decided to give up being Spider-man. I think this is great. It shows peter is a human and sometimes you just want to give up. So he does, and his life does get back on track. He's getting better grades, he can finally make it to MJ's play, he can possibly pay rent. He's starting to ignore crime, but soon realizes he can't stop. This is where the hero is tested and needs to come back. Crime is up 70%. Very similarly to the first movie there's a fire where Peter decides to be the hero himself, and he saves the baby, but just when he was about to be praised for his bravery he's told that someone was stuck and died. Once again peter realizes that Spiderman is needed. With great power comes great responsibility, so Spiderman comes back!Theres the bank robbery with the bags full of gold coins, which is very comic book like, and we have the iconic train battle. Peter gives it his all to stop the train and saves everyone, but he doesn't have his mask, and everyone sees him as a hero, and understand that they need him, so none of them say anything about his identity. This is hero praise done right. They respect the hero, despite revealing his identity probably getting the person famous or rich, they respect Spiderman for the sacrifice. And then when everyone tries to protect Spiderman it shows how everyone is trying to give back to Spiderman.After this Spiderman is given to Harry where we get a great scene where Harry finds out Peter is Spiderman to further fuel their rivalry.The third act is somewhat weak for me. MJ is of course the damsel in distress again, the reactor is a bit too unrealistic, but I do think
overall it was a pretty good fight with large stakes. Doc Ock sacrifices himself to finally stop the machine and MJ now knows who Spiderman. Peter finally gets his happy ending.This is one of the rare sequels where everything has been improved. I think Spiderman 2 is one of the best CBMs. It really shows the struggles and consequences of being a hero, and I think it was done marvelously.

Sequels are very tricky. They're very hard to crack open, but every so often we do get a sequel that is better than the original like Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, and others. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. The common thing among mostly all sequels is that bigger is better, that's not always the case, and that's where director Sam Raimi comes in, he does the opposite. He makes it smaller, more personal, but with big impactful moments. Here we see a damaged Peter Parker, still full of guilt with the death of Uncle Ben, he's getting fired all the time and late to school because he's busy protecting New York as Spider-Man. His relationship between Harry and Mary Jane are deteriorating as he keeps disappointing them. In the end, he gives up his duties as Spider-Man, only to return to action when Doctor Octopus is threatening the city. This movie in many ways is a coming of age story for Peter Parker. With a moving romantic subplot, Peter learns to accept his responsibilities as Spider-Man in the long run, and puts that first above all his desires including Mary Jane, and he also finds closure by telling Aunt May the truth about what happened on the night of Uncle Ben's murder. Tobey Maguire brings much depth and complexity to Peter Parker. A very fine performance by him showcasing the right amount of emotion in every single scene. Alfred Molina is excellent here as Dr. Otto Octavius, also known as Doctor Octopus, whom Peter deems as his idol in the beginning of the film. What makes him such as awesome and likable villain, is that film allows you to like him from the beginning, and to see his downfall to villainy, then to a redeemable hero at the end makes an engaging story. Give credit to Raimi and his writing team, as they provide Doc Ock much needed flare. Kirsten Dunst here is pretty good as Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane also get a lot time bickering at each other here. It's a very complicated and complex romance as she wants Peter and Peter wants her, but he can't cause of his duties as a crime-fighter. James Franco is great playing the a-hole friend. As an audience member it's very sad to see their friendship deteriorate as Harry questions Peter's loyalty to him or to Spider-Man. The action serves the story here, it seamlessly transitions to action set pieces while still serving the narrative. Not to mention they are awesome. All the fights between Spidey and Doc Ock are an adrenaline rush, particularly the subway train fight. But with that being said, if you took out all the action sequences in this movie, you still have a very intriguing and moving story to watch. That's how good this film is. Raimi and his crew of filmmakers did a tremendous job with Spider-Man 2. There are real human moments in this film, one of them involves Spidey and a group of civilians in the train. A real nice, tender, and human scene. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May even has a substantial role in the film as Peter's moral compass and she also has an action sequence in the middle of the film. J.K. Simmons is even better as J. Jonah Jameson this time around and has the film's funniest moments. Everything in this film clicks on all cylinders. The music by Danny Elfman is better than ever, and also provides the film with lots of tender scores. The visual effects are better, Spidey's web-swinging abilities are better, the romance is better, the action is better, the sound mixing and editing is better, the story, the acting, just everything. It's pretty much a perfect film. I for one thought it deserved just a little bit more from the Academy Awards other than winning the well deserved special effects award. 10/10

Spider-Man was almost the perfect comic book movie and perhaps released at the best time. When audiences get bored with what genres normally cook up (mostly horror) we the viewers always look for the next best thing. For a while, horror movies were all the fad, but these movies can become boring extremely fast and Hollywood must find something completely opposite from horror to try and keep our attention. So, what might be completely opposite from horror? Well first, lets make a list of what is opposite from horror. Happy is one, action is another; good guys always winning might be another. So, what might be a good opposite for horror is a comic book movie. Now, a lot of money comes from what Hollywood had to offer for comic book movies. Some are failures (Electra) and others are hits. For the most part, most of them are hits. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. We begin with Peter Parker continuing his job as Spider-Man, but all is not well. Peter's friend, Harry Osborn, hates Spider-Man and wants him dead. Because of Peter's relation with taking photographs of Spider-Man, Harry has problems with Peter that only continue to grow worse as the movie goes on. The main villain of this movie is Dr. Otto Octavius who later becomes Dr. Ock. In a freak accident, he is connected to his invention of arms that are suppose to help him with an even bigger invention. His wife is killed in the process and the arms attached to him seem to have complete control of what he does. Deeply grieved, Dr. Ock runs away and hides, but not for long. He comes to terms with what he has become and starts his life as super villain. As usual, it is up to Spider-Man to save the day, but something is not right. Spider-Man seems to be losing his powers and has no control of what is happening to him. It is true that this film is better than the first entry, but only by a little bit. It seems though, that scene were Peter saves the people a train was little over it when everyone on the train discovers he is Spider-Man. Overall: A- -Ben Russell

Now this is a super-hero movie, filled with crazy action scenes, great effects, funny moments and a little cheesiness. I can't explain why I like Spider-man movies so much, I even liked the 3rd movie which I admit it wasn't very good, but it was entertaining and it even managed to be very emotional for me.Spider-man has always been my favorite super-hero. There's just something about a super-hero fighting crime, struggling to pay the bills and trying to find time to study. It certainly was a hero that revolutionized the basic concept of the rich hero which has a secret base filled with costumes, weapons, gimmicks, wheels, etc. That AND Spider-man's charisma appealed to me, he is a funny character, he wears a funny costume (not too ninja-like that's for sure) and he has awesome powers! He is not an indestructible mutant nor a green beast with infinite strength... or even a guy who bursts into flames or shoots laser-beams outta his ass! He IS a simple hero and has enough to be cool and interesting, spider powers! After all he is your friendly neighbourhood Spider-man! And by the way, the original Spider-man created a hardening, sticky liquid/glue or whatever it is called, making his own web, because in spite of his initial superhuman powers, Peter Parker was also brilliant teenager and used that great intellect to his advantage. That good analysis and perception of his also saved his ass numerous times (I confess I used to be an avid reader of the comics and follower of its never-ending story).And this movie delivers all that, it shows how great of a super-hero spider-man really is, his crazy-ass awesome villains, his cheesy jokes, his athletic and jumpy fighting style, it's all awesome to be seen! And for action fans, be it chaotic scenes, be it car chases, sword fights or fisticuffs action, there are some scenes in this movie that will for sure please all of you. Starting from the Bank robbery all the way to the train stopping, it's candy for my eyes... Spider-man vs. Dr. Octupus, one of my favorite fights in Cinema history.

Inspired by the recent news about Tobey's likely return to playing the web-slinger in the MCU's Spider-Man 3, I rewatched this film. An IMDb score of 7.3 for this film is one of the biggest injustices I've seen on this website. In my opinion this is THE definitive and THE best superhero film of all time.This trilogy of films is my childhood. I've loved Spider-Man as long as I can remember and he has always been my favourite superhero. These films came out at just the right time when I was growing up so watching this films just brings it all back. And that's not to say my judgement of this film is blinded by nostalgia- this is genuinely an amazing film that holds up in the present day.The story is an interesting one, with Peter grappling with the personal consequences of being Spider-Man and feeling the subsequent effects, all whilst he fights the best Spider-Man villain ever to be put on screen, Alfred Molina's brilliantly menacing Doc Ock. The sequence in which Spider-Man returns and fights Doc Ock on the train is for me, the best superhero fight scene of all time and my favourite cinematic sequence ever. You can feel every punch, every wince and every scream- something that unfortunately, today's comic book flicks are devoid of.And it's not just all action and no heart- when it wants to tug on the heart strings it yanks them. The scene with Uncle Ben is so painful, raw and acted to perfection. It makes me tear up every time. There's also the usual Raimi campiness, with quips and funny moments giving the film a real charm about it. All of this is underlined by Danny Elfman's brilliant, bombastic and booming score that really does sound like the audio equivalent of a comic book.This film is a 120 minute thrill ride with heart-stopping action and heart-wrenching drama. The best superhero film ever made and my favourite film of all time.

Seems everybody LOVES this movie.  Even those I know who have good taste in movies say the LOVE it.Me?  I LIKED it.  I certainly didn't LOVE it.Naturally, the effects and much of the acting were outstanding.  This was to be expected in a movie with this budget and which had the impressive start which it did.Where it fell short was the STORY.  "WHAT", you say?  You thought the story was great?  Well, I will give it the fact that the story THEMES were in place.  The overall elements and directions of the story were worthwhile. However I felt when this story went from outline to a draft, it lost something.Everything, especially the characters, was 2-D.  Flat.  Unbelievable.  There were a number of points where it LOOKED like high drama; where one WISHED one could empathize with the characters.  However I could not, because these characters never came to life for me any more than wooden automatons.  It's as if the characters were thought of in terms of the coarse, archetypal way in which they would behave as opposed to with the refinement for the realism of human thought and behaviour.True, most movies are like this.  But this movie took some of these elements and overdramatized them.  They went over the top and thus out of the realm of believability.  Also part of why I noticed it so much in this movie is the POTENTIAL it had for being better.  Many of the actors, especially Tobey, were quite strong and capable of more.  Their own strengths made it more evident how shallowly the characters were developed.Peter Parker was entirely to "sappy" in this movie.  Not because of Tobey's portrayal, but because much of the movie focused upon him as a sympathetic character.  The problem here is that a few "hard knocks" can make for a sympathetic character.  Too many becomes surrealistic and downright comedic. Yet this movie was not meant to be padodic!What happend with Spidey's powers in this movie was nonsensical.  'Nuff said.Still, this movie had the visual effects and good action you would expect. It would be worth seeing just for the action scenes between Spidey and Doc Oc.  There were some funny moments (in fact, I wish there were MORE of them; this movie would have been more effective with a more comedic feel and less serious drama).All in all, I'm looking forward to the next installment of Spidey.  I only hope the writers can treat their characters more as living beings and less as 2-D archetypes.

I went to the midnight show last night and was completely blown away !! I am 30 years old and had begun reading the Amazing Spider-Man back when I was 11 and leaving the theater last night, I felt like I was a kid again- I was amazed, I was in awe, I really felt... satisfied.Every scene crackled. There was an energy, there was an effort put into every moment of the movie. No scene went on too long, no plot holes fell through. It was the comic, come alive.Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire did a great job of making Peter Parker sympathetic, you feel for him, you wince with him, he is the boy, becoming a man, and you watch it, and you keep watching it.Even as a long-time fan who knew where some of the story lines were going- with MJ, with Harry Osborne- to see HOW the movie chose to play out these stories, provided great surprises for me, I almost wished I didn't know... I can't wait to see the reactions of my friends who haven't followed the Spider-man comics, the twist of the story and the hints at what is to come...A great movie. Great fun. Great story. Great action. A blockbuster movie. You leave the theater, definitely feeling like you got your money's worth !

Uh I just saw spiderman 2 as a team outing. It's not that good.I mean it's OK. But there are times where I thought I was watching a B rated horror movie (in terms of the style of cinematography and cheesy dialog, I was thinking Army Of Darkness, which the main character of that movie happened to play the usher). That aside, I think they were going for a comic book feel on that. So then, 80% of the movie is slow ass crap. Which is either the love story situation, or the whole 'those who have a gift must use it for good' melodrama. There were times were I was borderline about to just walk out and finish it later when it comes out on DVD.Though it woulda been hilarious if when Harry, who was whining about his dad the entire movie, at one point when he see spiderman is Peter and goes "You killed my father! (for the 500th time)" instead of Peter going "there are bigger things going on than you and me..." but rather said "Dude, get over it already."They also coulda delved a bit more into why Peter was losing his powers. I was guessing that it was related to being totally stressed out. But the powers mysteriously come back at peak stress. Oh wait, lemme guess it's because "he believed in himself." (yawn)Spiderman 2 was dumbed down for kids. I don't think action movie goers care for the 2hr chick flick that this movie was, nor do kids. Love stories are always introduced for one primary purpose: it's inexpensive. Not that this movie was low budget, but if you chopped out 30 mins of the "filler", you would have had a better impact.Ah well... All in all 6.5/10.

This movie is by far one of the best movies of all time! The movie had pretty much everything you need for a prefect film: Script: 10/10! OUTSTANDING! Director Sam Raimi did an excellent job giving full attention to the Dilemma of Peter Parker. He balances all the action, comedy, and drama perfectly.Acting: 10/10. Tobey Maguire was very good being a character that doubts himself and has to choose between wanting a normal life and wanting to live as a superhero. Kirsten Dunst is very good in her roll as Mary Jane Watson. James Franco is amazing as the bitter Harry Osborn who is seeking revenge on Spider-Man. And Alfred Molina as Doc Ock is fantastic. He was an excellent choice as one of my favorite characters from the comic.Action Sequences: 10/10. This movie has some amazing action scenes with Doc Ock on the building. But the best effect in the film is the fight between Spidey and Doc Ock on the side of the train.Comedy: 8/10. J.K. Simmons is amazing as J. Jonah Jameson and adds a lot to the film. Ted Raimi is also very funny. The Raindrops sequence in the movie had a lot of laughs when you see Peter Parker as the nerdiest kid in the world.This movie has everything you could ever want out of a summer blockbuster. And as far as staying faithful to the comic book 10/10.PERFECT!!! 10/10

Once again another blockbuster that the media drones sell us, the movie was entertaining but far from the Hype! Can you say Matrix II? I guess with enough publicity anything can be a hit. Ms dunce, can she act? I loved "Dick" but since that, I haven't seen her do anything note worthy. Oh well I guess she doesn't have to act, put her in a wet t-shirt (yet again) and let all the 12-17 year old young men decide if it is a hit. I would also like to know why spidey has the costume if everyone knows who he is? Again entertaining, but not mega over the top. The more I think of the movie the less I think of it.

I guess I expected more.  This is a film for kids, I guess.  Given all the destruction and violence they encounter on TV and in video games, CGIs are just part of kid culture.  They expect it and tolerate it.  The bringing of comics to screen is hardly new and began back in the 30s and 40s.  Back then, the limits were imagination of the goofy directors who were able to patchwork props together to suggest the special effects.  Then, there were the old superman films with George Reeves which combined both...and they were pretty cheesey.  But, underlying all of this was the comic book heroes themselves.  Comic books were the epitome of the mythic journey where clear lines stood between the bad guys and the good guys.  You always knew who the villains were, just like in the cowboy movies.  They were invariably decked out in some symbolic feature like a tight-fitting costume, with the genitalia tastefully tucked away, which displayed the sleek, muscle-rippled bodies, all of which spelled out H-E-R-O.So, why does this film fall so flat?  It's got all the gimmicks, costumes, tension, unfairness, bad-guys who are basically good but taken over by some force they could not anticipate.  The brilliant scientist turned evil by his lack of foresight...the underlying message being, there are some secrets of nature, thou shalt not mess with.  Alas, the message is an anti-intellectual one and one that detracts from the power of the mythic struggle between good and evil.  It seemed to work well in the first film but the message in this is worn thin in this rehash.  There is a lack of continuity and the struggle of Peter Parker, which should be the struggle of every one, becomes a parody.  He gets knocked down, he gets stepped on, he gets slapped, he begins to lose his powers and descends into hell and is reborn. 
Those are powerful metaphors but they come across like a tune played on an old coffee can.  All we're left with is Peter Parker's confusion, growing self-doubts and final commitment, undermined by the girl he loves.  The sacrifice is made by the villain, Al Molina who refuses to "die a monster." We're left with the feeling there's still some good in the worst of us misguided souls.So, what's the lesson here?  Is Peter Parker willing to make that supreme sacrifice of love, career and normalcy, only to have it undermined by a now-understanding, woman who comes to him in the wedding dress she was wearing for another man, whom she ungenerously left at the altar?Stay tuned, as the James Dean-lookalike is waiting in the wings to don his father's garb for the next big money maker...while the suits like up to sell lots and oodles of Spidey goodies, games and treats.Could be, but maybe I'll pass the next one...I get the feeling I've seen it all before.
