This is an excellent movie, I enjoyed every bit of it. It has a cleverish dialogue, a good ascending of events, and a good ending. Long story short, this is a movie that should NOT die. Sure, it has some downs, for example the underwhelming thought-woulda- been-funny scenes (like the penguin's). The hispanic dude was really good though, he had this fine impact on the movie.Anyways, you gotta give this movie a shot, it is hilarious, and fantastic.

Henry Roth is a man afraid of commitment up until he meets the beautiful Lucy. They hit it off and Henry think he's finally found the girl of his dreams, until he discovers she has short-term memory loss and forgets him the very next day.At first, I just liked some of the usual humor: the use of spam to make me believe we were really in Hawaii. And also Rob Schneider, who is often the funniest person in Sandler's films. (He is still good here, though perhaps not at his best.) I was pleasantly surprised that amidst the stupid humor was an actual story about love and the growing bond of two people. There could have been a variety of "Groundhog Day" jokes. And indeed, there were some. But the character Sandler plays is actually quite sweet. Who knew?

This is quite simply a very enjoyable film. It's not, perhaps, a great film, but it is fun and it left me feeling pleasantly content. Basically this is a romantic comedy about a man (Henry) and a woman (Lucy) who meet and fall in love, there is just one problem: Lucy won't remember, tomorrow.It is easy to pick holes in films and yes there are things wrong with this film:- The first 5 to 10 minutes do seem a little out of place: I understand the need to set the scene, but couldn't help feeling that the pace and characterisations didn't quite fit with what was to come.Some of the characters take away from the story: Doug (Sean Astin) is a little over done and comes across as more damaged than his sister. Perhaps the worst, though, is Henry's female (?) assistant: this character was a mistake and did not belong in the film.In the end, these flaws don't matter: the film is enjoyable and that is what counts.The plot, even if somewhat contrived, is clever and in the context of the film believable: there is a good beginning, middle and surprisingly satisfying end. Some of the difficult aspects of the film are not ignored but properly dealt with. Clearly it is easy to read a sordid side into the idea of a man meeting a beautiful woman each day in the knowledge that she will forget everything and they can start again tomorrow. This is covered and Henry is asked some pointed questions; without giving anything away, his answers worked and leave us, the audience, able to enjoy the film, without any unpleasant nagging doubts or feelings of guilt.Don't analyse or pick holes; just watch this film. Chances are very good that you will enjoy it. It is a fantasy a bit of escapism: a first rate piece of entertainment and hopefully it will leave you, as it did me, feeling pleasantly content.

The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: Henry Roth lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment. Then he meets Lucy Whitmore. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn't even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn't overly stupid, but it's not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film's true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to Henry who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with Lucy, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. Henry's character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with Lucy, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn't really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn't even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended.

Not being an Adam Sandler fan, we avoided this film when it was released earlier last year. The premise sounded too much like "Groundhog Day". We took a chance the other night when it was shown on cable, and frankly, we found the movie entertaining. There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, "Punch Drunk Love".Drew Barrymore and Mr. Sandler had worked together before to surprisingly good results. They show an easy chemistry between them that serves the movie well. The idea of making Adam Sandler an aquarium doctor offers a lot of possibilities; his scenes with the walrus are hilarious.The supporting cast plays well together. A surprise was Rob Schneider, not one of my favorite actors, either, but in here, under the direction of Peter Segal, he delivers. Sean Astin, as the lisping brother on steroids is quite effective, as well as Blake Clark, as Lucy's father. Dan Aykroyd puts an appearance as the doctor who treats the young woman who has lost her long term memory.Watch it without any preconceptions, as probably it will surprise you.

50 First Dates is a very funny movie and for Sandler its one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a womanizing marine biologist afraid to commit, who falls for the woman of his dreams, played by Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, she has a brain disorder that makes her forget everything that happened the day before whenever she falls asleep, so every day, he needs to win her over and make her fall in love with him anew. The plot is nothing new as this movie is a cross between Memento and Groundhog Day both very good movies. What makes this movie work is the chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler since they work so great together and make the film fun and also this film is better then Sandler's last effort Anger Management. Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. Drew Barrymore is very good in her role as Lucy and she makes up for the horrible Duplex. The supporting cast is also very good with the best being Sean Austin. Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. The last main part of the cast is Dan Aykroyd and his role isn't very memorable. This movie has good intentions and some sad moments like when Lucy finds out she can never have her memory restored or when she sees pictures of herself from the accident. However, there's also some gross humor so I think this movie can appeal to everyone under the age of 21. Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy.

See, I am a married man. And watching this movie, at home on the sofa with my wife whom I love above anything and hopefully always will, almost brought me to tears and easily did her. This movie, no matter all the overdone/overacted characters and the fact that Adam Sandler is probably the worst person in the world the act crying, is simply the best description of love ever. To have the energy to every day win over the heart of the one you love, is what we all should do, though ever so often don't have the energy to.I believe that movie criticism often nitpicks too much on technical details or other such stuff of -actually- little importance. Show me a person who is not moved by this film and I show you a person who knows zip about real love. Real, I mean. I am not a religious person and this made me feel closer to what people often call God, whatever that is. Maybe I exaggerate, but I want to. And no work of art, of any genre, can be asked to do any more. On scale of 1 to 10, this goes to 11. (Can you see?!)

Okay, so "50 First Dates" is mostly silly, but they do a good job with it. Honolulu veterinarian Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) falls for Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), only to find out that, due to an accident, her memory only lasts one day, so she won't remember him the next day! How will Henry cope with this? The movie gravitates between goofy and sensitive, but never gets mind-numbing; Adam Sandler always has something up his sleeve, and he and Barrymore have a great time with the material. As is often the case in Adam Sandler's movies, one of the characters is an embarrassment to everyone else (in this case, it's Rob Schneider as Henry's whacked-out friend Ula). Great fun.Oh, and one more thing: don't watch "50 First Dates" if you haven't seen "The Sixth Sense" first.

Take a little "Memento," Add a generous helping of "Groundhog Day," and even a little of "Sommersby" and you have "50 First Dates". Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler create a synergy that neither has been able to capture with anyone else. Together, they produce a romantic team comparable to Gere and Roberts, Day and Hudson, Grant and Loren and Tracy and Hepburn. My wife and I watch "The Wedding Singer" at least once a year. While "50 First Dates" is a superior movie, I don't know if I can take the melancholy ending again.
For once I'm grateful for the Khamakazee antics of Sandler's acting ensemble, particulary Sean Astin and Rob Schneider.  If Schneider wasn't playing such a farcial role, he would be a natural for an Oscar. Certainly the animals add a lot to the farce. The goofy humor makes the basically tragic scenario not only bearable but almost pleasant. It's also genuinely funny.Sandler convincingly plays a marine biologist(!!!)in Hawaii who enjoys "entertaining" the "mainlanders." Sandler doesn't date "locals". He wants nothing to interfere with his dream of studying walruses. He discovers Barrymore having breakfast in a local bar and grill. What captures Sandler's attention, even more than her beauty, is Barrymore's creativity. What Sandler doesn't know is that Barrymore has brain damage. The brain cells which move short term memory to long term storage are destroyed. She forgots everything she's learned during the day while she sleeps. So, Sandler, the lothario who forgots his relationships with mainlanders after one week finds himself in love with a woman who forgets hers in 24 hours. That's writing genius, something you don't see very often, and Sandler, Barrymore, and Sandler's acting troupe handle it perfectly.Though my wife is physically handicapped, my mother has severe short term memory loss. So, I really related to the trajedy so expertly portrayed in "50 First Dates". It's not often I give a movie that leaves me this sad a "10". The last time, I believe, was "Sommersby". Nonetheless, "50 First Dates" is a "10," since there is nothing about it I can suggest that make it better. P.S. Looking forward to the NEXT Sandler/Barrymore collaboration.

*****No spoilers yet, safe to read until warning below.*****I hate the makers of this movie, and I will never forgive them. EVER. "50 first dates" as a movie per se was not too bad of a Hollywood romantic drama, sprinkled with a few comedy snippets. As such, I would have rated it 7.5 out of 10; it has plenty of entertainment value, and an adequate amount of originality to its storyline.The big problem for me came approximately 31 minutes into the movie. Let me say this before I begin with the spoiler: if you have not seen the movie "The sixth sense", directed by M. Night Shyamalan, starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, heed my warning: DO NOT WATCH "50 FIRST DATES" BEFORE YOU WATCH "THE SIXTH SENSE". Why? I'll explain immediately below.*****Begin spoiler for "50 first dates"*****31 minutes into this movie, it shows how Lucy (Drew Barrymore) relives her last day before the accident in every detail, while her brother and father set up and clean up after the activities of that day, over and over. One of the activities is to watch a videotape of "The sixth sense". It is a time honored tradition for movie studios to include footage of earlier productions, especially if we are talking about movies that have become classics. In this sense, there is nothing wrong with "50 first dates" showing a few scenes from the opening scenes of "The sixth sense". In fact, showing how Lucy becomes frightened watching TV, while her relatives react in a sad deja-vu manner, is an effective way of depicting how the repetition of this day's activities is taking a toll on them (the relatives).What follows next however, is totally disgusting, unconscionable and uncalled for: upon finishing their videotape, Lucy blurts out the surprise ending of "The sixth sense", with no warning and no useful effect on the plot of "50 first dates". This is called spoiling another film in the worst possible manner!!! I cannot express in words my disgust at this blatant act of chauvinism, as if the script were saying "You should have seen that movie by now; if not, you're screwed".I am of the opinion that "The sixth sense" was a far superior movie than "50 first dates". (The number of awards nominated for and won by the former supports my opinion.) I point out as matter of fact that neither film has ANYTHING to do with each other. The question that begs to be answered is then, what business did the writers of "50 first dates" have in revealing the ending of "The sixth sense"? WHAT THE F*** WERE THEY THINKING?!?!*****Begin spoiler for "The sixth sense"***** It turns out that I bought "The sixth sense" two-DVD set in a nice collector's edition box. As I watched it, I noticed too readily how the character played by Bruce Willis, a child psychologist, never spoke or confronted any person other than the boy played by H. J. Osment. He was never shown to be hired by the boy's mother. He never exchanged a word with his estranged wife. His actions were never shown to have an interactive effect with any other character of the movie. All these subtle details were carefully and meticulously filmed by director Shyamalan, but were intended to be reflected upon only after the viewer reached the final twist of this beautiful movie. For me, it was an agonizing torture to savor the tastelessness of each such detail, knowing all too well the ending that resonated in my head.So, who in the cast and crew of "50 first dates" is responsible for this atrocity? Drew Barrymore, for speaking the unspeakable? Director Peter Segal, for forcing the words into Ms. Barrymore's mouth? Writer George Wing, for the incontinence and flatulence of his pen? Ms. Nancy Karlin, script supervisor, for neglecting to wipe the droppings of the writer? Whoever was responsible for this atrocity, he or she earned my scorn for eternity.

This movie is so much more than what you think! It takes you on an emotional roller coaster. It is both hilarious and touching.I would recommend this to anyone that likes comedies or romantic comedies. I wouldn't recommend it for children, though. Some of the humor is too mature.Even if you're not an Adam Sandler fan, you'll love him in this. Same goes for Drew Barrymore.I love this movie, and I didn't think I would. The movie turned out to be more than what I thought. And it will be more than what you think, too!

6 July 2004. After a rather lame beginning that reflects the old Adam Sandler's more obnoxious character that he was well noted for, the movie eventually settles down to a rather innovative, creative, entertaining movie that captures the lovely and seasoned acting of Drew Barrymore and a maturing comedian Adam Sandler. While not much in the way of character depth nor real substance, this lightweight but clever movie plays on Groundhog Day and other Momento devices that contribute to a rather fun and enjoyable movie.Hopefully Drew will begin to expand on her future roles and Adam will begin to enter into a Tom Hanks, Robin Williams maturity phase that will really demonstrate what Adam is made of.

OK, let's get the obvious comments out of the way: "Groundhog Day" bladibladi "Memento" blablabla "The Misadventures of Death And Phug" blabla. Yes, this movie is about a person with no memory, repeating the same day over and over again. This has been done before, but it's not a cliché - and anyway, the angle of this movie is a lot different than those three, so let's just give all that a rest.In actual fact, I found the concept of this movie interesting - a real twist on the old love story fare. Man With Fear Of Commitment Finds Woman With No Memory - it's a fun little jigsaw. And, for all intents and purposes, the skeleton of this movie works fine. But. BUT! This is where I get annoyed. This movie is crammed full of pointless and annoying cheap gags. I don't know if it's just me, but I am not particularly appreciative of super-intelligent cutesy animals who understand everything said to them in plain English and respond with a suitable adorable sound/flipper gesture. Animals don't act like this. They never have, they never will. It p***es me off. Also, the movie just HAD to tack on some meaningless gross-out moments via the horny and androgynous Slavic assistant and (hold on to your hats and glasses) somebody getting showered from head to foot in walrus puke. Ah, the subtlety. And will somebody shut the old Hawaiian guy up, who has no function in the movie other than saying "hilarious" cuss words? I think the writer of the original screenplay is pretty horrified at how his movie was represented. I would have been.

Let me start this review by admitting that Adam Sandler is at the bottom of my 'funny people'-list. The guy just doesn't do anything for me. I don't think he's funny at all. I think Drew Barrymore is absolutely hilarious though and she carries every single movie she makes.The first ten minutes of the movie are awful. Every cliché in the books passes us and Adam Sandler is simply horrible. After the first ten minutes something changes though. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe I learned to appreciate the humor or maybe the movie got funnier, I don't know, but...what a great movie it is.I won't bore you with the story of the movie, but this is it in a nutshell: Henry (Adam Sandler) meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in a diner and the two really connect. The next day she doesn't remember him though and Henry finds out that due to a car accident, Lucy suffers from short memory loss. Meaning that everyday she wakes up under the impression that it's still the day of the car accident. She does the same thing every day, over and over again, not remembering what she did the day before. Henry believes Lucy is worth fighting for and every single day he manages to make Lucy fall in love with him. He hopes one day she will wake up and remember him. This of course never happens. He stays true to her though and the two get married and have a daughter.What surprised me about the movie is that it's definitely not just a comedy. Sure, it's funny at points and even hilarious sometimes (Like ten-second Tom for example), but...it's just very romantic. There's just something deep behind the whole idea of 'falling in love with someone over and over again'. This movie deals with that in the literal sense and there's just something beautiful about that.Conclusion: Drew Barrymore shines as always in this movie that goes a little deeper than your average romantic comedy. And Adam Sandler? He's not all that bad.I give this movie 8/10 stars. I loved it.

Adam Sandler's movies is mixed bag for me. Some of his works, are really horrible, however, this movie isn't one of those. This movie is one of my favorites from him. I have always been a huge fan of his romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore. Starting it with 1998's 'The Wedding Singer', and follow up with this movie. This movie directed by Peter Segal, has Adam Sandler as Henry Roth, a local veterinarian falling in love with Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) an amnesiac student in Hawaii. Since she has short-term memory loss cause by a car accident, Henry must learn how to recognize the difficulty of building a relationship with someone who will never remember you; and how to overcome that, for the reasons for love. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while, this movie concept seem depressing, I think screenwriter, George Wing and Adam Sandler put enough charming comedy in the film, so you don't have to think, how stressful, it must be, for Lucy to wake up to find out, her entire life has change. While, the memory impairment suffered by Barrymore's character is fictitious, I think the movie gave enough respect to her ailment, that it doesn't seem, just like a running joke. Drew Barrymore plays her illness, very well. The movie really does explore, what struggles, she has to tend with, and if Henry Roth should even continue to love her. Because of that, this movie is a lot more mature and emotional driven than Sandler's earlier works. It's both heart-warming and very heart-breaking at the same time. Both Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore work well with the story. I'm glad, that Sandler's role in this, wasn't of a man-child, with anger issues, and an annoying lisp. He was somewhat charismatic. I can see a woman like Drew Barrymore falling in love with him. Even the supporting characters were strong, they share some good emotional scenes and some really fun laughs. I like Sue (Amy Hill) the Hukilau café manager and friend of Lucy and her late mother. She was so motherly. Pomaika'i Brown as Nick, the Hukilau café chef was a guy, I would love to hang out with. Even Lucy's father, Marlin (Blake Clark) & steroid-dependent brother, Doug (Sean Astin) was watchable. I think the only jokes that didn't go well is with the supporting characters of Ula (Rob Schneider), the native-Hawaiian friend & Alexa (Lusia Strus), Henry's ambiguously gendered assistant. I found the gay jokes to Alexa to be a bit mean-spirited; while Ula felt a bit offensive, with the over-the-top Hawaiian Yellow face racism stereotypes. While, some of the jokes, are offensive, gross, and not call for. Most of them, really works with the script. Very few jokes, fall flat. Even the pop culture shout outs inside jokes like the brain institute is funded by auto parts manufacturer T.B. Callahan of Sandusky, Ohio from 1995's film, 'Tommy Boy" fame & how the characters go to a golf course like 1996's Happy Gilmore' were clever enough that it was fun to see, even if most audience didn't get it. It's even funny, when the movie makes mistakes, like saying the Boston Red Sox didn't win the World Series, when they did that year. Not only was the movie, very funny, but the movie was very beautifully shot. I love the fact that they shot in real Hawaii Island locations. The rural shots really makes this film, seem very unique, compared to the other Adam Sandler's films that mostly take place in an urban New York City like settling with way too much product placement being shown. It's a blessing in disguise. One of the big things about this movie has to be the music. I love the tunes of the Beach Boys, playing in the background. 'Wouldn't it be nice" to have music like this, again. The other song, worth noticing, from the film is the covers song from Hawaiian native artist, Israel "IZ" Kamakawiwoʻole. I love his covers for 'Somewhere over the Rainbow" and 'What a Wonderful World'. His tropical reggae version of 'Somewhere over the Rainbow', is my favorite version of the song from the 1939's 'Wizard of Oz'. It's beats singer, Judy Garland's version, 50 times over. It's so good, I kinda wish, it was the state anthem for Hawaii. That's how much, I like that version. I also love the fact that this movie, help inspire 'real world application treatment for people with early dementia. It's nice for them, to watch a video every morning in which they see comforting messages and reminders from family members that they may still know. If that's not a good reason to love this movie, than I don't know, what is! The movie is also so good, that in 2014, a Malayalam film titled 'Ormayundo Ee Mukham' was created, to capitalize on the premise. Overall: While, '50 First Dates' doesn't have the complexity and depth of something like 1993's 'Groundhog Day', with a similar theme. It was entertaining enough to be stand out. In the end; check it out. You will find yourself, loving this movie as well.

I will admit right now, I am not an Adam Sandler fan. However, I found this film to be surprisingly enjoyable. It is sweet and cute in places, and while certainly not a masterpiece it is above decent. A vast majority of the jokes work here, and that was great to see, and the direction was surprisingly subtle. The camera work was good making good use of the gorgeous scenery, and the soundtrack was lovely. I had little problem with the performances; Adam Sandler gives of his more likable performances, and Drew Barrymore is the persona of sweetness as his love interest. Out of the supporting performances, Rob Schneider guarantees a number of laughs, and Sean Astin comes close to stealing the film in places. But it is the chemistry of Sandler and Barrymore that shines through despite the flaws that mar it from being more than enjoyable.While Dan Aykroyd has a small appearance, it is sadly one that isn't particularly memorable. The plot isn't exactly original, and certainly isn't the most interesting one ever. And the script does have its ups and downs, and is predictable. Overall though, it is a sweet feel good film. It has its flaws, but it is a brave attempt at a romantic comedy, and mainly because of the chemistry of the two leads it mostly succeeds. 7/10 Bethany Cox

I can't think of any romantic comedy team of the past 20 years (other than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan) who perfectly fit each other like Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. They totally charmed me in "The Wedding Singer", so to see them together again in this totally sweet comedy was a treat. This is a film that other than a few sad sequences had me smiling the entire time in addition to laughing. Other than the opening (which seemed out of place, having a dozen or so women talking about their first and last date with Sandler) and a few gag sequences straight out of early Sandler films, this is a complete charmer, filled with romance and humanity, and perhaps, Sandler's most lovable character. As much as I like his early work ("Billy Madison", "Happy Gilmore", and reluctantly "Little Nicky"), those films were filled with an anger missing from this and "The Wedding Singer". Together, Sandler and Barrymore are a perfect match, and I hope they do more films together.The basic storyline has Sandler meeting Barrymore in a Hawaiian restaurant, and not realizing she is brain damaged following a car accident, pursues her romantically. He has no idea that her short-term memory only lasts one day, and like an etch-a-sketch, erases once she goes to sleep. Rather than desert her, however, Sandler decides that he loves her enough to give up his own dreams just to be with her. He wins the trust of her eccentric father and her lisping, steroid taking brother, who once they realize he is sincere, allow him to court her anew on a daily basis. This leads to a situation that creates many entertaining moments and leads to a potential of sadness that it takes a magnificent writer to end in a satisfying conclusion.As usual, there are the typically eccentric supporting characters, familiar to those who know Sandler's work. From the funny (if a bit creepy looking) Hawaiian pothead (and his group of likable kids) to Sandler's androgynous Russian co-worker, as well as the staff of the Hawaiian restaurant, there's a lot of amusing bits with these delightful wackos. Even an amusing gross-out bit with a very funny walrus at the beginning doesn't come off as disgusting since its done so sweetly. If more recent Hollywood comedies could be like this, all would be right in the world of cinema. I can't think of another recent romantic comedy that is written with such love. This is what Hollywood magic is all about.

first i have to say, I'm a guy. give me mindless violence, car chases, and explosions, and i'm going to be happy with any movie. i don't normally go for a "romantic" movie of any kind, even with drew barrymore in it, although she is an impressive talent, and definitely not hard to watch in any movie. but this one is, well, different.what gets me with a lot of romance movies is that, all that happens is romance, and it gets really. really stupid after awhile (geez, you guys, get a room!!). the other thing is that, everyone overcomes the adversity (often what brought them together in the first place) and they live sappily...i mean...happily ever after. if they don't, it's a tragedy, and everyone leaves all weepy eyed over them. 50 first dates does neither of these things. first, the adversity of drew barrymore's character surviving a serious accident, which her father blames himself for, leaving her with brain injuries that, by the diagnosis of the doctor, are not going to be repairable (as opposed to most of the movies "it's possible", and they do recover). this proves mostly that, if the person isn't going to recover and become perfect again in the other movies, the romance is over. this movie, right from the start, tells you she isn't going to recover, a fact that adam sandler's character doesn't seem to be bothered by. he remains by her side, despite the fact that she doesn't know who he is at the start of every day. his handling of this situation is not only insightful, but down right inspirational (and totally comedic in many cases).it has the romance, but doesn't base the entire movie on it. for the guys, it even has the violent scene, as she protects her "unknown" boyfriend from his attacker "ula", beating him with a baseball bat while chasing him across the field. it shows the seriousness of the injury, as she watches a video of newspaper clippings telling her what she's lost, but also gives you rib-cracking comedy when, upon waking up in the morning and finding a "stanger" in bed with her, she proceeds to knock him unconscious, prompting her brother's comment of "maybe i can't kick your *** but my sister can".if more romantic movies were like this, i'd like more romantic movies. it doesn't end as a tragedy, because it isn't. but she doesn't end as perfect either, showing that, in his eyes, she is perfect, and that's what mattered. telling us that it's okay to see the one we care for, and overlook the imperfections. a message movie that doesn't harp on it, or make you feel sorry for her. i can handle that.all in all, a movie i could watch again and again.

This movie goes beyond any other expectation of love.I never would have imagined a story so well portrayed.It's funny and shows how love takes us to greater strengths to show those we love most.Definitely recommend this movie.It has it's off moments that makes me say "what in the world were they thinking?", but overall I give it a 10. Made me cry like a baby in the end no matter the times I've seen it.If we all went the extra mile for a love one as in here, more marriages would last.

Adam Sandler plays a ladies man who falls for adorable Drew Barrymore, only to discover she suffers from a short term memory disorder that causes her to forget everything that happens today. So the next day she relives today over again. Sweet, endearing, funny romantic comedy. Sandler and Barrymore are both great and continue to display the wonderful chemistry they had in The Wedding Singer. Guys, it's not all sappy romantic stuff. Although I personally don't mind that. There's plenty of comedy here, too, with a fine supporting cast that helps bring the laughs. Rob Schneider sucks but everybody else is fun. Love Joe Nakashima's small part. It's a great movie that should put a smile on the face of anyone but the grouchiest among us.

I have to admit I did not see the entire movie.I managed to sit through 20 minutes of this movie that was not at all funny and insulted my sense of humor.This is only the second movie I have ever walked out of the theatre before it was over.High point of the movie experience?   Theatre gave us free passes.

When "50 First Dates) came to theaters, I really wasn't interested enough to go see it. When it came out on video, I waited about 2 months to see it until it came down to the $1.99 rental price.Was I surprised! This movie was so entertaining to me, that I wound up buying it. I only buy about 5 or 6 videos a year, so you can see that I really must have enjoyed it. It won't win any Oscars, but it will make you feel good when you watch it.I am familiar with the condition that Lucy has here having a cousin who has a similar problem and has had it for several years. I was really concerned with how a production company can play a condition like that for laughs, but, somehow, they pulled it off. They treated the subject matter with dignity showing that the people who have this terrible condition can (and do) have somewhat normal lives. My cousin does it the diary way. She doesn't lose her memory everyday, but at different times. She has gone as long as 3 months in retaining her memory and has lost it on other occasions after 4 hours. I am not a big Adam Sandler fan, having always thought he was a bit "over the top" in his other films. I thought he was going to do this in this film as well after the first few minutes of the movie. However, when he is shown in the diner with Lucy, he shows that he is really a nice guy who, deep down, wants to find a relationship that is fulfilling with a pretty girl.Drew Berrymore is another actress that I don't particularly care for most of the time, but she is really a sweetheart playing Lucy. She is just so lovable in this role, it's hard to believe that she has the Demons in her past. Rob Schneider is very good in his supporting role as is Sean Astin as Doug, the 'roid raging brother of Lucy.Again, not an Oscar winner, but well worth the $15 or so to purchase it at WalMart.Marty

You know, this movie was actually worth remembering. Sandler does a funny take on an actual syndrome in which a person has extremely limited short term memory. In this movie, Lucy Whitmore's (Drew Barrymore) memory cache is cleared every 24 hours. Her father and brother do all they can to make her life normal, they do a daily routine to set things up as though every day was the day after her last memory. Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) throws a wrinkle in her life when he tries to woo her in spite of knowing of her memory problem.The story made for some very funny situations, and the Sandler/Barrymore duo is a good combination (definitely a whole lot better than the Sandler/Ryder combo). The movie doesn't blow you away, but it provides some good laughs and a heart-felt ending.

Expected to see "Groundhog Day Meets Memento" as a subject of one of the moronic viewers here (although "See It 50 Times!!!" never seemed like a possible refrain so thought I'd try to jump that gun.Taking the former's premise, penultimate bachelor/hound Sandler has to woo brain-damaged Drew every day in a (totally) different way...Why he does this (in that totally different way) is never clear.  Why she doesn't respond exactly the same way every day isn't clear either.Which is okay.My wife and I saw this the day it was released, and we were vacationing in Hawai'i, on Oahu, where some of this is filmed (and where all of it is set).We'd just visited the Sea Life touristy park where Sandler's character is purportedly one of the marine biologists.Side note: there are no walruses on any island of Hawai'i, so the entire opening comedy blitz is lame.  Sea lions yes.  Walruses no.As for the film, it really couldn't be more manipulative.  Some of the comedy yanks a laugh, many of the scenes with Barrymore draw tears.Schneider's fairly good as a native Hawai'ian but his character is as stereotypical as you'll find (see the Honolulu Star-Bulletin for 2/13/04).Oh yeah -- Sean Astin isn't a Hobbit here.  As Barrymore's brother he's a lisping steroid-enhanced freak.Literally not worth writing the rest of this review.Truly a dog among barf jokes.Rent "The Wedding Singer" if you'd like to see this pair go toe to slipper.

The story serves a really rare medical condition as the base of a quirky yet very touching romantic story. To be able to make someone fall in love with you again every single day is a herculean effort if we really think about it. Presenting this concept in a comedy really brings it to a very fun level. I really like the early parts where Henry would do over ad over his mistakes with newer and newer ways. The practical jokes are very much entertaining. I really like how Lucy bludgeons Ula in helping Henry. All the side ingredients also fared well. The things with Alexa and Doug comes in well and funny to the end. The acting job is a very goo overall. Adam Sandler manages to be still funny amidst the story that is more focused on the romantic and touching side. Drew Barrymore acted out great as the girl who gets her memory wiped out clean every single morning. Having additional big names such as Sean Astin and Dan Aykroyd sure didn't hurt this movie.

This is an excellent movie, I enjoyed every bit of it. It has a cleverish dialogue, a good ascending of events, and a good ending. Long story short, this is a movie that should NOT die. Sure, it has some downs, for example the underwhelming thought-woulda- been-funny scenes (like the penguin's). The hispanic dude was really good though, he had this fine impact on the movie.Anyways, you gotta give this movie a shot, it is hilarious, and fantastic.

Henry Roth is a man afraid of commitment up until he meets the beautiful Lucy. They hit it off and Henry think he's finally found the girl of his dreams, until he discovers she has short-term memory loss and forgets him the very next day.At first, I just liked some of the usual humor: the use of spam to make me believe we were really in Hawaii. And also Rob Schneider, who is often the funniest person in Sandler's films. (He is still good here, though perhaps not at his best.) I was pleasantly surprised that amidst the stupid humor was an actual story about love and the growing bond of two people. There could have been a variety of "Groundhog Day" jokes. And indeed, there were some. But the character Sandler plays is actually quite sweet. Who knew?

This is quite simply a very enjoyable film. It's not, perhaps, a great film, but it is fun and it left me feeling pleasantly content. Basically this is a romantic comedy about a man (Henry) and a woman (Lucy) who meet and fall in love, there is just one problem: Lucy won't remember, tomorrow.It is easy to pick holes in films and yes there are things wrong with this film:- The first 5 to 10 minutes do seem a little out of place: I understand the need to set the scene, but couldn't help feeling that the pace and characterisations didn't quite fit with what was to come.Some of the characters take away from the story: Doug (Sean Astin) is a little over done and comes across as more damaged than his sister. Perhaps the worst, though, is Henry's female (?) assistant: this character was a mistake and did not belong in the film.In the end, these flaws don't matter: the film is enjoyable and that is what counts.The plot, even if somewhat contrived, is clever and in the context of the film believable: there is a good beginning, middle and surprisingly satisfying end. Some of the difficult aspects of the film are not ignored but properly dealt with. Clearly it is easy to read a sordid side into the idea of a man meeting a beautiful woman each day in the knowledge that she will forget everything and they can start again tomorrow. This is covered and Henry is asked some pointed questions; without giving anything away, his answers worked and leave us, the audience, able to enjoy the film, without any unpleasant nagging doubts or feelings of guilt.Don't analyse or pick holes; just watch this film. Chances are very good that you will enjoy it. It is a fantasy a bit of escapism: a first rate piece of entertainment and hopefully it will leave you, as it did me, feeling pleasantly content.

The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: Henry Roth lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment. Then he meets Lucy Whitmore. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn't even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn't overly stupid, but it's not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film's true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to Henry who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with Lucy, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. Henry's character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with Lucy, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn't really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn't even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended.

Not being an Adam Sandler fan, we avoided this film when it was released earlier last year. The premise sounded too much like "Groundhog Day". We took a chance the other night when it was shown on cable, and frankly, we found the movie entertaining. There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, "Punch Drunk Love".Drew Barrymore and Mr. Sandler had worked together before to surprisingly good results. They show an easy chemistry between them that serves the movie well. The idea of making Adam Sandler an aquarium doctor offers a lot of possibilities; his scenes with the walrus are hilarious.The supporting cast plays well together. A surprise was Rob Schneider, not one of my favorite actors, either, but in here, under the direction of Peter Segal, he delivers. Sean Astin, as the lisping brother on steroids is quite effective, as well as Blake Clark, as Lucy's father. Dan Aykroyd puts an appearance as the doctor who treats the young woman who has lost her long term memory.Watch it without any preconceptions, as probably it will surprise you.

50 First Dates is a very funny movie and for Sandler its one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a womanizing marine biologist afraid to commit, who falls for the woman of his dreams, played by Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, she has a brain disorder that makes her forget everything that happened the day before whenever she falls asleep, so every day, he needs to win her over and make her fall in love with him anew. The plot is nothing new as this movie is a cross between Memento and Groundhog Day both very good movies. What makes this movie work is the chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler since they work so great together and make the film fun and also this film is better then Sandler's last effort Anger Management. Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. Drew Barrymore is very good in her role as Lucy and she makes up for the horrible Duplex. The supporting cast is also very good with the best being Sean Austin. Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. The last main part of the cast is Dan Aykroyd and his role isn't very memorable. This movie has good intentions and some sad moments like when Lucy finds out she can never have her memory restored or when she sees pictures of herself from the accident. However, there's also some gross humor so I think this movie can appeal to everyone under the age of 21. Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy.

See, I am a married man. And watching this movie, at home on the sofa with my wife whom I love above anything and hopefully always will, almost brought me to tears and easily did her. This movie, no matter all the overdone/overacted characters and the fact that Adam Sandler is probably the worst person in the world the act crying, is simply the best description of love ever. To have the energy to every day win over the heart of the one you love, is what we all should do, though ever so often don't have the energy to.I believe that movie criticism often nitpicks too much on technical details or other such stuff of -actually- little importance. Show me a person who is not moved by this film and I show you a person who knows zip about real love. Real, I mean. I am not a religious person and this made me feel closer to what people often call God, whatever that is. Maybe I exaggerate, but I want to. And no work of art, of any genre, can be asked to do any more. On scale of 1 to 10, this goes to 11. (Can you see?!)

Okay, so "50 First Dates" is mostly silly, but they do a good job with it. Honolulu veterinarian Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) falls for Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), only to find out that, due to an accident, her memory only lasts one day, so she won't remember him the next day! How will Henry cope with this? The movie gravitates between goofy and sensitive, but never gets mind-numbing; Adam Sandler always has something up his sleeve, and he and Barrymore have a great time with the material. As is often the case in Adam Sandler's movies, one of the characters is an embarrassment to everyone else (in this case, it's Rob Schneider as Henry's whacked-out friend Ula). Great fun.Oh, and one more thing: don't watch "50 First Dates" if you haven't seen "The Sixth Sense" first.

Take a little "Memento," Add a generous helping of "Groundhog Day," and even a little of "Sommersby" and you have "50 First Dates". Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler create a synergy that neither has been able to capture with anyone else. Together, they produce a romantic team comparable to Gere and Roberts, Day and Hudson, Grant and Loren and Tracy and Hepburn. My wife and I watch "The Wedding Singer" at least once a year. While "50 First Dates" is a superior movie, I don't know if I can take the melancholy ending again.
For once I'm grateful for the Khamakazee antics of Sandler's acting ensemble, particulary Sean Astin and Rob Schneider.  If Schneider wasn't playing such a farcial role, he would be a natural for an Oscar. Certainly the animals add a lot to the farce. The goofy humor makes the basically tragic scenario not only bearable but almost pleasant. It's also genuinely funny.Sandler convincingly plays a marine biologist(!!!)in Hawaii who enjoys "entertaining" the "mainlanders." Sandler doesn't date "locals". He wants nothing to interfere with his dream of studying walruses. He discovers Barrymore having breakfast in a local bar and grill. What captures Sandler's attention, even more than her beauty, is Barrymore's creativity. What Sandler doesn't know is that Barrymore has brain damage. The brain cells which move short term memory to long term storage are destroyed. She forgots everything she's learned during the day while she sleeps. So, Sandler, the lothario who forgots his relationships with mainlanders after one week finds himself in love with a woman who forgets hers in 24 hours. That's writing genius, something you don't see very often, and Sandler, Barrymore, and Sandler's acting troupe handle it perfectly.Though my wife is physically handicapped, my mother has severe short term memory loss. So, I really related to the trajedy so expertly portrayed in "50 First Dates". It's not often I give a movie that leaves me this sad a "10". The last time, I believe, was "Sommersby". Nonetheless, "50 First Dates" is a "10," since there is nothing about it I can suggest that make it better. P.S. Looking forward to the NEXT Sandler/Barrymore collaboration.

*****No spoilers yet, safe to read until warning below.*****I hate the makers of this movie, and I will never forgive them. EVER. "50 first dates" as a movie per se was not too bad of a Hollywood romantic drama, sprinkled with a few comedy snippets. As such, I would have rated it 7.5 out of 10; it has plenty of entertainment value, and an adequate amount of originality to its storyline.The big problem for me came approximately 31 minutes into the movie. Let me say this before I begin with the spoiler: if you have not seen the movie "The sixth sense", directed by M. Night Shyamalan, starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, heed my warning: DO NOT WATCH "50 FIRST DATES" BEFORE YOU WATCH "THE SIXTH SENSE". Why? I'll explain immediately below.*****Begin spoiler for "50 first dates"*****31 minutes into this movie, it shows how Lucy (Drew Barrymore) relives her last day before the accident in every detail, while her brother and father set up and clean up after the activities of that day, over and over. One of the activities is to watch a videotape of "The sixth sense". It is a time honored tradition for movie studios to include footage of earlier productions, especially if we are talking about movies that have become classics. In this sense, there is nothing wrong with "50 first dates" showing a few scenes from the opening scenes of "The sixth sense". In fact, showing how Lucy becomes frightened watching TV, while her relatives react in a sad deja-vu manner, is an effective way of depicting how the repetition of this day's activities is taking a toll on them (the relatives).What follows next however, is totally disgusting, unconscionable and uncalled for: upon finishing their videotape, Lucy blurts out the surprise ending of "The sixth sense", with no warning and no useful effect on the plot of "50 first dates". This is called spoiling another film in the worst possible manner!!! I cannot express in words my disgust at this blatant act of chauvinism, as if the script were saying "You should have seen that movie by now; if not, you're screwed".I am of the opinion that "The sixth sense" was a far superior movie than "50 first dates". (The number of awards nominated for and won by the former supports my opinion.) I point out as matter of fact that neither film has ANYTHING to do with each other. The question that begs to be answered is then, what business did the writers of "50 first dates" have in revealing the ending of "The sixth sense"? WHAT THE F*** WERE THEY THINKING?!?!*****Begin spoiler for "The sixth sense"***** It turns out that I bought "The sixth sense" two-DVD set in a nice collector's edition box. As I watched it, I noticed too readily how the character played by Bruce Willis, a child psychologist, never spoke or confronted any person other than the boy played by H. J. Osment. He was never shown to be hired by the boy's mother. He never exchanged a word with his estranged wife. His actions were never shown to have an interactive effect with any other character of the movie. All these subtle details were carefully and meticulously filmed by director Shyamalan, but were intended to be reflected upon only after the viewer reached the final twist of this beautiful movie. For me, it was an agonizing torture to savor the tastelessness of each such detail, knowing all too well the ending that resonated in my head.So, who in the cast and crew of "50 first dates" is responsible for this atrocity? Drew Barrymore, for speaking the unspeakable? Director Peter Segal, for forcing the words into Ms. Barrymore's mouth? Writer George Wing, for the incontinence and flatulence of his pen? Ms. Nancy Karlin, script supervisor, for neglecting to wipe the droppings of the writer? Whoever was responsible for this atrocity, he or she earned my scorn for eternity.

This movie is so much more than what you think! It takes you on an emotional roller coaster. It is both hilarious and touching.I would recommend this to anyone that likes comedies or romantic comedies. I wouldn't recommend it for children, though. Some of the humor is too mature.Even if you're not an Adam Sandler fan, you'll love him in this. Same goes for Drew Barrymore.I love this movie, and I didn't think I would. The movie turned out to be more than what I thought. And it will be more than what you think, too!

6 July 2004. After a rather lame beginning that reflects the old Adam Sandler's more obnoxious character that he was well noted for, the movie eventually settles down to a rather innovative, creative, entertaining movie that captures the lovely and seasoned acting of Drew Barrymore and a maturing comedian Adam Sandler. While not much in the way of character depth nor real substance, this lightweight but clever movie plays on Groundhog Day and other Momento devices that contribute to a rather fun and enjoyable movie.Hopefully Drew will begin to expand on her future roles and Adam will begin to enter into a Tom Hanks, Robin Williams maturity phase that will really demonstrate what Adam is made of.

OK, let's get the obvious comments out of the way: "Groundhog Day" bladibladi "Memento" blablabla "The Misadventures of Death And Phug" blabla. Yes, this movie is about a person with no memory, repeating the same day over and over again. This has been done before, but it's not a cliché - and anyway, the angle of this movie is a lot different than those three, so let's just give all that a rest.In actual fact, I found the concept of this movie interesting - a real twist on the old love story fare. Man With Fear Of Commitment Finds Woman With No Memory - it's a fun little jigsaw. And, for all intents and purposes, the skeleton of this movie works fine. But. BUT! This is where I get annoyed. This movie is crammed full of pointless and annoying cheap gags. I don't know if it's just me, but I am not particularly appreciative of super-intelligent cutesy animals who understand everything said to them in plain English and respond with a suitable adorable sound/flipper gesture. Animals don't act like this. They never have, they never will. It p***es me off. Also, the movie just HAD to tack on some meaningless gross-out moments via the horny and androgynous Slavic assistant and (hold on to your hats and glasses) somebody getting showered from head to foot in walrus puke. Ah, the subtlety. And will somebody shut the old Hawaiian guy up, who has no function in the movie other than saying "hilarious" cuss words? I think the writer of the original screenplay is pretty horrified at how his movie was represented. I would have been.

Let me start this review by admitting that Adam Sandler is at the bottom of my 'funny people'-list. The guy just doesn't do anything for me. I don't think he's funny at all. I think Drew Barrymore is absolutely hilarious though and she carries every single movie she makes.The first ten minutes of the movie are awful. Every cliché in the books passes us and Adam Sandler is simply horrible. After the first ten minutes something changes though. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe I learned to appreciate the humor or maybe the movie got funnier, I don't know, but...what a great movie it is.I won't bore you with the story of the movie, but this is it in a nutshell: Henry (Adam Sandler) meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in a diner and the two really connect. The next day she doesn't remember him though and Henry finds out that due to a car accident, Lucy suffers from short memory loss. Meaning that everyday she wakes up under the impression that it's still the day of the car accident. She does the same thing every day, over and over again, not remembering what she did the day before. Henry believes Lucy is worth fighting for and every single day he manages to make Lucy fall in love with him. He hopes one day she will wake up and remember him. This of course never happens. He stays true to her though and the two get married and have a daughter.What surprised me about the movie is that it's definitely not just a comedy. Sure, it's funny at points and even hilarious sometimes (Like ten-second Tom for example), but...it's just very romantic. There's just something deep behind the whole idea of 'falling in love with someone over and over again'. This movie deals with that in the literal sense and there's just something beautiful about that.Conclusion: Drew Barrymore shines as always in this movie that goes a little deeper than your average romantic comedy. And Adam Sandler? He's not all that bad.I give this movie 8/10 stars. I loved it.

Adam Sandler's movies is mixed bag for me. Some of his works, are really horrible, however, this movie isn't one of those. This movie is one of my favorites from him. I have always been a huge fan of his romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore. Starting it with 1998's 'The Wedding Singer', and follow up with this movie. This movie directed by Peter Segal, has Adam Sandler as Henry Roth, a local veterinarian falling in love with Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) an amnesiac student in Hawaii. Since she has short-term memory loss cause by a car accident, Henry must learn how to recognize the difficulty of building a relationship with someone who will never remember you; and how to overcome that, for the reasons for love. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while, this movie concept seem depressing, I think screenwriter, George Wing and Adam Sandler put enough charming comedy in the film, so you don't have to think, how stressful, it must be, for Lucy to wake up to find out, her entire life has change. While, the memory impairment suffered by Barrymore's character is fictitious, I think the movie gave enough respect to her ailment, that it doesn't seem, just like a running joke. Drew Barrymore plays her illness, very well. The movie really does explore, what struggles, she has to tend with, and if Henry Roth should even continue to love her. Because of that, this movie is a lot more mature and emotional driven than Sandler's earlier works. It's both heart-warming and very heart-breaking at the same time. Both Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore work well with the story. I'm glad, that Sandler's role in this, wasn't of a man-child, with anger issues, and an annoying lisp. He was somewhat charismatic. I can see a woman like Drew Barrymore falling in love with him. Even the supporting characters were strong, they share some good emotional scenes and some really fun laughs. I like Sue (Amy Hill) the Hukilau café manager and friend of Lucy and her late mother. She was so motherly. Pomaika'i Brown as Nick, the Hukilau café chef was a guy, I would love to hang out with. Even Lucy's father, Marlin (Blake Clark) & steroid-dependent brother, Doug (Sean Astin) was watchable. I think the only jokes that didn't go well is with the supporting characters of Ula (Rob Schneider), the native-Hawaiian friend & Alexa (Lusia Strus), Henry's ambiguously gendered assistant. I found the gay jokes to Alexa to be a bit mean-spirited; while Ula felt a bit offensive, with the over-the-top Hawaiian Yellow face racism stereotypes. While, some of the jokes, are offensive, gross, and not call for. Most of them, really works with the script. Very few jokes, fall flat. Even the pop culture shout outs inside jokes like the brain institute is funded by auto parts manufacturer T.B. Callahan of Sandusky, Ohio from 1995's film, 'Tommy Boy" fame & how the characters go to a golf course like 1996's Happy Gilmore' were clever enough that it was fun to see, even if most audience didn't get it. It's even funny, when the movie makes mistakes, like saying the Boston Red Sox didn't win the World Series, when they did that year. Not only was the movie, very funny, but the movie was very beautifully shot. I love the fact that they shot in real Hawaii Island locations. The rural shots really makes this film, seem very unique, compared to the other Adam Sandler's films that mostly take place in an urban New York City like settling with way too much product placement being shown. It's a blessing in disguise. One of the big things about this movie has to be the music. I love the tunes of the Beach Boys, playing in the background. 'Wouldn't it be nice" to have music like this, again. The other song, worth noticing, from the film is the covers song from Hawaiian native artist, Israel "IZ" Kamakawiwoʻole. I love his covers for 'Somewhere over the Rainbow" and 'What a Wonderful World'. His tropical reggae version of 'Somewhere over the Rainbow', is my favorite version of the song from the 1939's 'Wizard of Oz'. It's beats singer, Judy Garland's version, 50 times over. It's so good, I kinda wish, it was the state anthem for Hawaii. That's how much, I like that version. I also love the fact that this movie, help inspire 'real world application treatment for people with early dementia. It's nice for them, to watch a video every morning in which they see comforting messages and reminders from family members that they may still know. If that's not a good reason to love this movie, than I don't know, what is! The movie is also so good, that in 2014, a Malayalam film titled 'Ormayundo Ee Mukham' was created, to capitalize on the premise. Overall: While, '50 First Dates' doesn't have the complexity and depth of something like 1993's 'Groundhog Day', with a similar theme. It was entertaining enough to be stand out. In the end; check it out. You will find yourself, loving this movie as well.

I will admit right now, I am not an Adam Sandler fan. However, I found this film to be surprisingly enjoyable. It is sweet and cute in places, and while certainly not a masterpiece it is above decent. A vast majority of the jokes work here, and that was great to see, and the direction was surprisingly subtle. The camera work was good making good use of the gorgeous scenery, and the soundtrack was lovely. I had little problem with the performances; Adam Sandler gives of his more likable performances, and Drew Barrymore is the persona of sweetness as his love interest. Out of the supporting performances, Rob Schneider guarantees a number of laughs, and Sean Astin comes close to stealing the film in places. But it is the chemistry of Sandler and Barrymore that shines through despite the flaws that mar it from being more than enjoyable.While Dan Aykroyd has a small appearance, it is sadly one that isn't particularly memorable. The plot isn't exactly original, and certainly isn't the most interesting one ever. And the script does have its ups and downs, and is predictable. Overall though, it is a sweet feel good film. It has its flaws, but it is a brave attempt at a romantic comedy, and mainly because of the chemistry of the two leads it mostly succeeds. 7/10 Bethany Cox

I can't think of any romantic comedy team of the past 20 years (other than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan) who perfectly fit each other like Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. They totally charmed me in "The Wedding Singer", so to see them together again in this totally sweet comedy was a treat. This is a film that other than a few sad sequences had me smiling the entire time in addition to laughing. Other than the opening (which seemed out of place, having a dozen or so women talking about their first and last date with Sandler) and a few gag sequences straight out of early Sandler films, this is a complete charmer, filled with romance and humanity, and perhaps, Sandler's most lovable character. As much as I like his early work ("Billy Madison", "Happy Gilmore", and reluctantly "Little Nicky"), those films were filled with an anger missing from this and "The Wedding Singer". Together, Sandler and Barrymore are a perfect match, and I hope they do more films together.The basic storyline has Sandler meeting Barrymore in a Hawaiian restaurant, and not realizing she is brain damaged following a car accident, pursues her romantically. He has no idea that her short-term memory only lasts one day, and like an etch-a-sketch, erases once she goes to sleep. Rather than desert her, however, Sandler decides that he loves her enough to give up his own dreams just to be with her. He wins the trust of her eccentric father and her lisping, steroid taking brother, who once they realize he is sincere, allow him to court her anew on a daily basis. This leads to a situation that creates many entertaining moments and leads to a potential of sadness that it takes a magnificent writer to end in a satisfying conclusion.As usual, there are the typically eccentric supporting characters, familiar to those who know Sandler's work. From the funny (if a bit creepy looking) Hawaiian pothead (and his group of likable kids) to Sandler's androgynous Russian co-worker, as well as the staff of the Hawaiian restaurant, there's a lot of amusing bits with these delightful wackos. Even an amusing gross-out bit with a very funny walrus at the beginning doesn't come off as disgusting since its done so sweetly. If more recent Hollywood comedies could be like this, all would be right in the world of cinema. I can't think of another recent romantic comedy that is written with such love. This is what Hollywood magic is all about.

first i have to say, I'm a guy. give me mindless violence, car chases, and explosions, and i'm going to be happy with any movie. i don't normally go for a "romantic" movie of any kind, even with drew barrymore in it, although she is an impressive talent, and definitely not hard to watch in any movie. but this one is, well, different.what gets me with a lot of romance movies is that, all that happens is romance, and it gets really. really stupid after awhile (geez, you guys, get a room!!). the other thing is that, everyone overcomes the adversity (often what brought them together in the first place) and they live sappily...i mean...happily ever after. if they don't, it's a tragedy, and everyone leaves all weepy eyed over them. 50 first dates does neither of these things. first, the adversity of drew barrymore's character surviving a serious accident, which her father blames himself for, leaving her with brain injuries that, by the diagnosis of the doctor, are not going to be repairable (as opposed to most of the movies "it's possible", and they do recover). this proves mostly that, if the person isn't going to recover and become perfect again in the other movies, the romance is over. this movie, right from the start, tells you she isn't going to recover, a fact that adam sandler's character doesn't seem to be bothered by. he remains by her side, despite the fact that she doesn't know who he is at the start of every day. his handling of this situation is not only insightful, but down right inspirational (and totally comedic in many cases).it has the romance, but doesn't base the entire movie on it. for the guys, it even has the violent scene, as she protects her "unknown" boyfriend from his attacker "ula", beating him with a baseball bat while chasing him across the field. it shows the seriousness of the injury, as she watches a video of newspaper clippings telling her what she's lost, but also gives you rib-cracking comedy when, upon waking up in the morning and finding a "stanger" in bed with her, she proceeds to knock him unconscious, prompting her brother's comment of "maybe i can't kick your *** but my sister can".if more romantic movies were like this, i'd like more romantic movies. it doesn't end as a tragedy, because it isn't. but she doesn't end as perfect either, showing that, in his eyes, she is perfect, and that's what mattered. telling us that it's okay to see the one we care for, and overlook the imperfections. a message movie that doesn't harp on it, or make you feel sorry for her. i can handle that.all in all, a movie i could watch again and again.

This movie goes beyond any other expectation of love.I never would have imagined a story so well portrayed.It's funny and shows how love takes us to greater strengths to show those we love most.Definitely recommend this movie.It has it's off moments that makes me say "what in the world were they thinking?", but overall I give it a 10. Made me cry like a baby in the end no matter the times I've seen it.If we all went the extra mile for a love one as in here, more marriages would last.

Adam Sandler plays a ladies man who falls for adorable Drew Barrymore, only to discover she suffers from a short term memory disorder that causes her to forget everything that happens today. So the next day she relives today over again. Sweet, endearing, funny romantic comedy. Sandler and Barrymore are both great and continue to display the wonderful chemistry they had in The Wedding Singer. Guys, it's not all sappy romantic stuff. Although I personally don't mind that. There's plenty of comedy here, too, with a fine supporting cast that helps bring the laughs. Rob Schneider sucks but everybody else is fun. Love Joe Nakashima's small part. It's a great movie that should put a smile on the face of anyone but the grouchiest among us.

I have to admit I did not see the entire movie.I managed to sit through 20 minutes of this movie that was not at all funny and insulted my sense of humor.This is only the second movie I have ever walked out of the theatre before it was over.High point of the movie experience?   Theatre gave us free passes.

When "50 First Dates) came to theaters, I really wasn't interested enough to go see it. When it came out on video, I waited about 2 months to see it until it came down to the $1.99 rental price.Was I surprised! This movie was so entertaining to me, that I wound up buying it. I only buy about 5 or 6 videos a year, so you can see that I really must have enjoyed it. It won't win any Oscars, but it will make you feel good when you watch it.I am familiar with the condition that Lucy has here having a cousin who has a similar problem and has had it for several years. I was really concerned with how a production company can play a condition like that for laughs, but, somehow, they pulled it off. They treated the subject matter with dignity showing that the people who have this terrible condition can (and do) have somewhat normal lives. My cousin does it the diary way. She doesn't lose her memory everyday, but at different times. She has gone as long as 3 months in retaining her memory and has lost it on other occasions after 4 hours. I am not a big Adam Sandler fan, having always thought he was a bit "over the top" in his other films. I thought he was going to do this in this film as well after the first few minutes of the movie. However, when he is shown in the diner with Lucy, he shows that he is really a nice guy who, deep down, wants to find a relationship that is fulfilling with a pretty girl.Drew Berrymore is another actress that I don't particularly care for most of the time, but she is really a sweetheart playing Lucy. She is just so lovable in this role, it's hard to believe that she has the Demons in her past. Rob Schneider is very good in his supporting role as is Sean Astin as Doug, the 'roid raging brother of Lucy.Again, not an Oscar winner, but well worth the $15 or so to purchase it at WalMart.Marty

You know, this movie was actually worth remembering. Sandler does a funny take on an actual syndrome in which a person has extremely limited short term memory. In this movie, Lucy Whitmore's (Drew Barrymore) memory cache is cleared every 24 hours. Her father and brother do all they can to make her life normal, they do a daily routine to set things up as though every day was the day after her last memory. Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) throws a wrinkle in her life when he tries to woo her in spite of knowing of her memory problem.The story made for some very funny situations, and the Sandler/Barrymore duo is a good combination (definitely a whole lot better than the Sandler/Ryder combo). The movie doesn't blow you away, but it provides some good laughs and a heart-felt ending.

Expected to see "Groundhog Day Meets Memento" as a subject of one of the moronic viewers here (although "See It 50 Times!!!" never seemed like a possible refrain so thought I'd try to jump that gun.Taking the former's premise, penultimate bachelor/hound Sandler has to woo brain-damaged Drew every day in a (totally) different way...Why he does this (in that totally different way) is never clear.  Why she doesn't respond exactly the same way every day isn't clear either.Which is okay.My wife and I saw this the day it was released, and we were vacationing in Hawai'i, on Oahu, where some of this is filmed (and where all of it is set).We'd just visited the Sea Life touristy park where Sandler's character is purportedly one of the marine biologists.Side note: there are no walruses on any island of Hawai'i, so the entire opening comedy blitz is lame.  Sea lions yes.  Walruses no.As for the film, it really couldn't be more manipulative.  Some of the comedy yanks a laugh, many of the scenes with Barrymore draw tears.Schneider's fairly good as a native Hawai'ian but his character is as stereotypical as you'll find (see the Honolulu Star-Bulletin for 2/13/04).Oh yeah -- Sean Astin isn't a Hobbit here.  As Barrymore's brother he's a lisping steroid-enhanced freak.Literally not worth writing the rest of this review.Truly a dog among barf jokes.Rent "The Wedding Singer" if you'd like to see this pair go toe to slipper.

The story serves a really rare medical condition as the base of a quirky yet very touching romantic story. To be able to make someone fall in love with you again every single day is a herculean effort if we really think about it. Presenting this concept in a comedy really brings it to a very fun level. I really like the early parts where Henry would do over ad over his mistakes with newer and newer ways. The practical jokes are very much entertaining. I really like how Lucy bludgeons Ula in helping Henry. All the side ingredients also fared well. The things with Alexa and Doug comes in well and funny to the end. The acting job is a very goo overall. Adam Sandler manages to be still funny amidst the story that is more focused on the romantic and touching side. Drew Barrymore acted out great as the girl who gets her memory wiped out clean every single morning. Having additional big names such as Sean Astin and Dan Aykroyd sure didn't hurt this movie.
