This is the third installment in the life of Jim Levenstein and his friends. "American Wedding" seems to point out there will be follow up movies perhaps. Why not? This formula has produced three films and could "American Children", "American Divorce", "American Single Dad", etc. will be too far behind? Jesse Dylan directs this one.The film is typical of the gross movie genre. The only excuse to watch this one is Seann William Scott, who as the obnoxious Steve Stifler, is at his nastiest self in the film. Stifler has great moments, such as in the sequence involving the rescue of the ring that one of the dogs has have swallowed! Jason Biggs, the groom of the film, seems to be playing second fiddle as Seann William Scott's part was made more important to his own, which in a way is what keeps the film alive because the nerdy Jim doesn't elicit much fun when he shows on screen. Eugene Levy, Fred Willard and Deborah Rush have good moments in the film.Let's just hope the people behind these installments will see the light and put all these characters to rest and give us more of Mr. Scott in his own vehicles.

Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are getting married. We get introduced to Michelle's family (Fred Willard, Deborah Rush, January Jones). The gang is back. Sadly for Jim and Michelle, so is Stifler (Seann William Scott). He insists on butting in on their lives. If only Jim doesn't need Stifler to teach him how to dance.It's one outrageous setup after another. Certainly the humor level is the expected level we've come to love from the previous two movies. There are some missing actors like Chris Klein and the girls. The franchise is resting on much fewer hands. It is mostly Stifler going crazy and embarrassing Jim at every turn. Without the rest of the cast, this is too much Stifler. It becomes a slapstick sitcom with much of the heart missing.

It was lacking some ingrediants, or cast members, but only an AMERICAN PIE movie could make good of that issue.Its had a great soundtrack, like the others It is hard to say which AMERICAN PIE installment is the best cause there all just one outrageous saga. This is a great (supposed) finish to the AMERICAN PIE series. Id say AMERICAN WEDDING had more laughs that both its predeccesors, even though i never thought that would be possible. It also was a little sweeter. Id consider it more of a Wedding cake. if you liked the first one and second, or at least one of those two, u like this one equally or better. AMERICAN WEDDING delivers  a super slice of guilty, raunchy pleasure. You laugh and laugh, and still laugh even the 20th time u watch it...

There's one thing you have to say for `American Wedding': like the two `American Pie' films that came before it, it is unapologetically unashamed of its shamelessness.  Here's a film that doesn't try to hide its gleeful perverseness under a bushel of coy double entendres; instead the film revels in its frank and openhearted treatment of sexuality and lust.  `American Wedding' is clearly a comedy about sex and it doesn't pretend to be anything but.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad will, I suppose, depend on your own affinity and tolerance for jokes and images that routinely push the boundaries of common decency and good taste.  In fact, the film wears its tastelessness almost as a badge of honor.  And just in case you're unfamiliar with this series and its brand of humor, subtlety and wit are not considered virtues in an `American Pie' world.In `American Wedding,' Jim and Michelle - he a self-described pervert and she a self-described nympho - have finally agreed to tie the knot.  The film centers around Jim's attempts to convince Michelle's square, uptight, sexually repressed parents that he is indeed husband material for their less-than-innocent daughter.  The problem is that his efforts are consistently being undermined by the inane, out-of-control antics of Steve Stifler, the foulest-mouthed, dirtiest-minded professional adolescent this side of Bluto Blutarsky.  Seann William Scott, in fact, steals the show as Stifler, providing an over-the-top manic energy that is both endearing and infectious.Indeed, without Stifler, there would be precious little to recommend this particular `American' outing.  The jokes and setups, for the most part, are crude and graphic without being very imaginative, and writer Adam Herz and director Jesse Dylan, even when they hit on an inspired piece of silliness (as when Stiffler winds up dancing mano a mano with a guy in a gay bar), end up diluting the humor by letting the scenes drag on well past the point where they're truly funny anymore.   This is not to say that there aren't a few good laughs in `American Wedding,' just that they don't come often enough to really lift the film much above the ordinary.  Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie.  In the film's defense, I would also add that, like its two predecessors and unlike many sexually charged teen comedies, `American Wedding' conveys a certain affection for its characters.  In addition to Stifler, Jason Biggs as Jim and Eugene Levy as Jim's befuddled but strangely tolerant and supportive father come across as decent, well-meaning and likable individuals.The film itself may be uneven, but as a character actor who makes an indelible impression on the material at hand, Scott is the genuine article. He transforms what is essentially cinematic rotgut into sweet-tasting vintage wine.  All hail the Stifman!

Although it was a bad movie, it was fun to watch.I wouldn't recommend it, but I would also recommend it, if you want to have fun.

The gangs back together, and now there having to cope with life after college (sadly Oz, Heather, Nadia, Jessica and Vicki have all moved on, oh! and the shermanator 'but He'll Be Back! in Band Camp; but that's another story) So with a new environment and only half the original cast, how does the third in the series shape up? I'm glad to say that it still carry's on the Pie tradition, Jim still finds himself in the most embarrassing of situations, Stiffler's still hell bent on one thing and Jim's dad is still offering his own unique brand of advice to anyone who'll listen.Overall the gags are lacking the freshness they once had, but with some new characters and some great comedy scenes the American Pie hasn't quite crumbled yet.7/10

While it has it's share of terrific scenes and Seann William Scott is a comic genius - American Pie - The Wedding (which it's known as here in Australia) isn't quite as good as the first two. The reason seems to be that things seem much more contrived this time out, and not as spontaneous as the original was. The highlight is obviously the bachelor party scene which has some great moments for Finch, Stifler and Jim, but there aren't as many laughs as in the first two, which is a shame. Add to this a dull opening act (things don't get going until Stifler enters the scene) and lots of filler where not much really goes on, American Pie - The Wedding is a good but not great, possible end to a nonetheless fine comedy series. But here's hoping that Stifler and the rest of the team have one more of these in them, because they're such appealing movies even when they're not laugh-out-loud funny.

Let me start by saying that I am passionately in love with Seann William Scott. I think he's one of the finest pieces of man ever to grace the screen, for so many reasons.Secondly, I'm a huge, HUGE fan of both American Pie I and II. I could watch both of them over and over again, and have, as a matter of fact.But American Wedding SUCKED. It felt hollow, empty, and painful. It was like watching a former beauty queen drunkenly struggle into a pair of too-tight pantyhose. There was no dignity about this movie, no joy, no lighter-than-air charm. What happened to all the strong, delightful females? What happened to Oz? Nobody even mentions him. How sad, and what an unforgivable oversight.Even my beloved SWS came across as gimmicky and self-conscious. Stifler isn't endearing anymore; the actor knows he's a hot commodity, and that all eyes are on him. Quite frankly, he buckles under the pressure. (I'm sorry, Seannie, but it's how I feel).I came away from this movie feeling quite forlorn. I'd been expecting so much, but received so little. Even the audio commentary with SWS did nothing to allay my blues, because he ends up sounding like nothing more than a typical San Fernando Valley "like, ya know, oh man, dude, kinda like"...doofus.Sigh. I've heard he's a doll in real life. And maybe he's a pistol in the sack. We can only hope.

I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because for a comedy it made me laugh continuously.  Not a minute was wasted.  Even if the situation was totally absurd, as many were, the conviction of the actors in their roles was enough to keep it going.  Stiffler and Finch's rivalry reached new highs and lows in this one as they compete for the affections of Michelles virgin little sister Cadence.  Fred Willards addition in this third movie was welcome, even if his role was subtle.I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie. The plots were simple but believable.. How complex can a wedding story be anyways.  It made sense, it was funny, it was definately funnier than the second american pie movie.. im not going to say it was funnier than the first but I definately laughed longer and harder in this one.  Well done. Plus Alyson Hannigan is somehow getting hotter as the movies progress.

Not quite at previous heights but more than enough laughs to make this worthwhile!

American Wedding is the weakest of the series but its still very funny and very enjoyable to watch. Jim and Michelle are getting married and Jim wants nothing wrong to happen. Stifler is going to the wedding against the wishes of Jim and Michelle. He is more interested in Cadence who is Michelle's sister and one of her bridesmaids. The wedding is close and there are a lot of things left to do. However, some of the wedding plans go wrong and it looks like this wedding is going to be a disaster, Can Jim pull it together and make it through the wedding? The plot is interesting as one of the guys get married. With this type of film though, the plot is a non issue. People who see this type of movie just want to have a good laugh and they won't be disappointed. The bets thing about this sequel is defiantly Stifler. Sean William Scott gives a really funny performance and pretty much carries this film. He goes over the top sometimes but for the most part he is pretty good. Jason Biggs gives a god performance as Jim. He is pretty much the same as the first two films so if you liked him before then you will like him again. Alyson Hannigan plays Michelle and I find her character really annoying and not funny. Eddie Kaye Thomas does an okay job as Finch, he just isn't as funny as he is in the previous films. Thomas Ian Nicholas plays Kevin and he is sort of just there. He doesn't do anything memorable his character is kind of countless at times. Eugene Levy is back as Jim's dad and he gives a funny performance. Compared to the first two though, its not as strong. January Jones plays Cadence and does a really bad job. If she wasn't pretty then she probably wouldn't be in Hollywood. Fred Willard and Deborah Rush play Michelle's parents. They both are very funny and nice additions to the cast. Missing from the film this time around are Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Natasha Lyonne and Mena Suvari. They are not missed and their characters wouldn't really feel right in this film either. James B. Rogers directs and does a good job. The jokes in the film may be funny but they are not as good as the first two. Its surprising how good this film turned out to be as the second sequel is usually stale and bad. Running time is 106 minutes with the directors cut and it's the version you should see. The movie is also a bit more serious at times then the other two. This isn't a bad thing but its just a little different mood then expected. In the end, this is a very funny sequel that's worth checking out. Rating 7.2/10

American Wedding is the funniest film in the American Pie series. Most of the original gang is back to see Jim and Michelle tie the knot. But, the two characters have to overcome a couple of obstacles. One obstacle is making sure Stifler behaves himself. Does he... not really. Stifler throws a bachelor party when Michelle's parents are supposed to turn up, eats dog crap while saying it's chocolate, losing the ring, and having sex with Jim's grandmother. Stifler is by far the most funniest character in the film, especially when he plays nice boy. Jim and his father are funny, too. I liked the part when Jim shaves his privates and throws the shavings out the window and into people's mouths and wedding cake. The characters are original and hilarious. The acting was great, so was the directing. As with the first two films, there is a great soundtrack. I recommend seeing this grand finale. I rate this film a 10/10.

So, here we are then with the third installment of the American Pie series. The first one was a refreshing take on the teen comedy. I'm not a massive fan of the genre, but thanks to good writing and interesting characters, the film worked. The second one was more of the same, but in spite of that it still managed to be entertaining enough to be considered 'good'. This third part again can be considered 'more of the same', except this time there's a wedding theme and, thankfully, the writers have isolated the dead wood from the other two films and dropped it. The dumb jock, Mena Suvari (good actress, crap character), Kevin's girlfriend...you get the point, have been dropped. This leaves us to concentrate on the more interesting characters - Jim, obviously but more notably Stifler, Finch and Jim's dad; who are the real stars of the series anyway. As usual, they're the ones that are relied on to bring in the laughs, and they do it to the standard that you'd expect. None of them are quite as funny as they have been and Stifler's character seems to have become more outrageous, rather than keeping in with what's gone before...but who cares in a film like this? Character coherency isn't too much of an issue anyway.The central theme of the wedding is how most of the jokes come about, and it creates four big set-pieces; two of which work, and two of which don't. Seeing Stifler dancing in a gay bar is hilarious and sure to delight everyone that sees the film, but even funnier than that is the part where Stifler hires two exotic dancers to 'entertain' the boys...at the same time that Jim has invited Michele's parents round for a 'chat'...oops! The two that don't work are more disgusting than funny...and I'm sure you'll see which parts I mean upon seeing the movie. As you might expect from the conclusion (hopefully!) of a series and one that sees two of it's characters tie the knot, there's a degree of sentiment here; but it does work, and it's even kind of nice to see after watching the characters 'develop' (somewhat, anyway) over the last two films.American Wedding is a decent comedy, and one that I would recommend to anyone that liked the other two films.

First of, let's talk about the 1st 2 movies, they both successfully followed the same continuous rhythm with pretty much the same characters but each had their own uniqueness and addition to the story and characters development.But this one was so confused! first of all, there were too much focus on Stifler's character; which is weird and too much since the previous 2 movies had solid plots for each and every member of the gang, making this element a key factor to why American Pie is so relatable and light-heartedly represents the good old high-school gang with various characters and views but they still stick together.How about Michelle's character? it barely had any presence and pretty much zero character development -which is weird since the whole movie should be about a wedding in which she is the bride-.To sum it all up, it was a movie about Stifler trying to impress parents and to hook up with a confused girl. And it just DRAGGED ON, trying too much to recreate the funny awkwardness that the first 2 movies were characterized by, but it was too heavy and unnatural, it didn't have any flow to it.

Despite an embarrassing scene at a restaurant, Jim proposes to his long-time girlfriend Michelle.  For their wedding Jim enlists the help of Finch and Kevin to make everything smooth  and keep Stifler out of the way.  However a ceremony is hard work and is made harder when things just always seem to go wrong and when Stifler seems to be determined to f**k the bride's sister  even if it means pretending to be mild mannered and polite.Trying to think about this film or the series itself is like trying to argue with mud, basically you just need to accept that this is a silly, stupid gross out comedy that relies on poor taste jokes and unlikely set ups.  If this is a problem for you then don't watch it.  If you have accepted it and are watching it then it all comes down to, is it a GOOD gross out comedy with poor taste jokes?  As much as I know I should be above it, I did laugh at the other 2 films and was happy to go and see this and, for the most part, I laughed at this.  However this was the weakest of the three and the silence in the cinema was quite often uncomfortable  usually silence in a cinema is a good thing, but this was often an uncomfortable `I should be laughing more' type of silence.In my review of part 2 I said `lets not do a 3'.  Watching this I'm sort of glad they managed to do it but I can see the strain despite their best efforts.  The main set up sequences are gross and funny but the gaps between are where the silence comes, there ain't enough comedy to cover the whole film.  I'm not talking about the sweet stuff near the end, I just talking about all the scenes between the banner scenes.  Plus the sequences are very forced at times (many you can see coming for miles), but this isn't too bad as they still manage to be hilariously gross!  For those who like the nudity (and who didn't like the bi-sexual teasing scene from part 2?) there is a long sequence of strippers with large fake breasts, if that's your thing (I'm a man, so yes!) which is funny but also serves up the mandatory t&a. There are also some scenes that are TOO forced  eg the dance in the gay bar is funny but is too long and feels like a good idea with average delivery.The film bravely loses something like half the cast and makes the film better in that regard.  In fact Kevin has so little to do that they could have lost his character all together.  However this is offset by the change to Stifler.  In the first 2 he is obnoxious and rude but he is also the brunt of more jokes than he is the punisher.  In the first half here, he is very rude and annoying and you hate him for how he treats his friends.  That makes all his early antics hard to laugh at because now all you can see is a jerk hurting people.  In the second half this is less of an issue as he changes a little and gets what's coming to him (and how!).  I have a theory that Scott knows he has been pigeon holed in this role and is desperate to get out of it  in fact when I saw Bullet Proof Monk I did think to myself that he is just playing a kung-fu Stifler.  Knowing this I think he played Stifler at full volume so that his next role would be nowhere near this performance.  Thus he has a weird crazed sneer on his face, he is ultra cruel and rude and is a real jerk  hard to laugh with (but luckily still easy to laugh at).The rest of the cast do quite well.  Biggs manages to make more of his role than the victim and is sensitive when he needs to be  I think it will be hard for him to shake off Jim (pardon the pun) but he shows he can do acting when he needs to.  Hannigan's innocent girlie voice is a little grating now and doesn't sit with her image as a woman  it suited her to be a geek. Luckily she doesn't have that much to do after the funny opening scene. Thomas is OK but Nicholas just kind of hangs around with a half smile of his face and nothing to do.  Levy is still brillant as Jim's Dad but misses his `awkward moment' relationship (which they give him with Michelle to repeat it).  Jones is eye candy and the return of Stifler's Mon (forget her name) is pointless and a mistake that is happily kept to a few moments.Overall this is as poor a film as you expect  rude, in poor taste, lacking a strong plot or performances, but none of these things are really fair comments as the film still manages to be funny.  The character of Stifler makes the first half very hard to enjoy and there are too many bits that don't work or where I didn't laugh but I still laughed.  Many viewers will feel that the series has simply fizzled out despite it still being funny.

"American Wedding" is a still good and original comedy but it unfortunately never comes close to the high level of the previous two American Pie movies. There are several explanations to why this is.The first thing is because of the formula that already has been milked out a bit now in the previous two movies. All the freshness is gone and because of that the movie also becomes predictable at times.Second thing are the characters. For some reason the characters don't work out as good as in the previous two movies. They are not in college any more and they're no longer teenagers and are now part of the normal everyday society. The normal world doesn't exactly suit the characters and they work better in a teenage college environment. The characters had been changed a bit too much to fit into this movie with as a result that they are less funny and especially the sidekicks get very little interesting to do in this movie.I'm sounding negative but it still is a good and enjoyable movie that has some well conceived moments in it that are good for some serious laughs. Also what makes this comedy better than the average movie is the Stifler character played by Seann William Scott. He brings real life to the movie and his character is even more prominently present as in the previous two movies. His character truly carries the movie and is the main reason why this movie is a fun one to watch, even though compared to the first two American Pie movies it isn't nearly as good and fresh.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

American Wedding is a decent conclusion to the American Pie trilogy, although several characters from the first two films are sorely missing in this one (including Chris Klein). However, unlike the second film, this one is as original as the first film, with the main focus being the wedding between Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan as Jim and Michelle. Joining the cast again are Seann William Scott as the funny Stifler and a hilarious Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. Jennifer Coolidge also again makes an always hilarious cameo as Stifler's mom. Another thing to point out, all 3 films were either written or co-written by Adam Herz, thereby bringing a cohesive glue between all 3 films (which would otherwise be lacking if different writers handled all 3 films). A still funny 7 out of 10.

I don't know if it is due to the change of director or something else but this sequel to the legendary series morphed into a romantic comedy. The original cast is reduced and most of the characters except Jim and Stifler lost their vibes. The film is overwhelmed with romance, and the raunchiness does not go well. However, it is still watchable for American Pie fans.

If you watch the Unrated DVD of "American Wedding" check out the "writer's commentary." I just assumed this was a new writer who was brought in after the guys who did "American Pie I & II" got tired of this. Not so -- incredibly, the same guy wrote all three! This is a tired movie -- it should be entitled "The Stifler Compromise" because, really, it's all about the writer's obvious love for the Stifler character who grows old and weary after 5 minutes. He's kind of like the funny friend you remember from junior high who never grew up. Do you really want to see 90 minutes of  Stifler jerking around like an idiot, screeching potty mouth language and trying desperately to be funny? For some reason Ebert gave this a good review and I can't figure that out. The scene he cited as hilarious -- Stifler on the gay disco -- was dumb and pathetic. And this is from a guy who thought the first "American Pie" was and is a classic!Pass on this. Save the dough and watch "Napoleon Dynamite" instead!

May be a SPOILER for some:
To me i thought this movie was mostly about stifler, i mean most of the movie showed him screwing up and making the wedding even more difficult although he did manage to fix up some of his mistakes and do some helpful chores:Screwups: Walked into the gay bar trying to find leslie summers, insulted leslie's friends and then started the whole dance competition.set up the bachelor party at Jims house when Jim was about to have the special talk with Michelles parents.accidentally fed the wedding band to the Michelles parents dogsate dog poopKilled all the wedding flowersscrewed Jims grandmaHelpful:motivated the florist to set up more flowersand taught Jim to dance.
Overall Stifler took up most of the movie, it was still great

After the release of "American Pie II", a major milestone came into effect that rarely has ever been done before. It was great to see a sequel actually produced more laughs than the original "American Pie". This is thanks mainly by producer Chris Moore and producer Adam Herz. The sequel provided more sympathy for the characters; you get a better understanding of their personality traits and their behavioural patterns in a clearer picture. In addition to that it was purely comical.Sadly though, the third instalment to the series "American Wedding" failed to live up to the expectations of the previous two films. Partially because a lot of the cast members from the original two movies are nowhere to be found, which is not particularly a bad thing because Oz (Chris Klein), Vicky (Tara Reid) and Heather (Mena Suvari) were never really that appealing to me? But still Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) was greatly missed. What really made this sequel really disappointing was that the characters have been badly demoted to wooden clichés of themselves. Sue the series was saturated with crude, rude and lewd jokes and I guess it's just not right to pull away from that tradition by continuing where they left off as opposed to adding new and original humour. So now we see another situation where Jim finds himself at another disadvantage involving his genitals. In the second instalment, Stifler gets urinated on, so it comes to no surprise that the third instalment feces will come into play here. I guess my rant is that the routines that follow tend to be too tiring and predictable.If the absence of characters from the other two movies wasn't appalling or the tiring routines that follow from the other two instalments, the ultimate letdown in "American Wedding" is the character of Stifler (Sean William Scott). I mean of the series, Stifler was one of the funnier supporting characters in the whole series. Mr. Herz really outdid himself when he created a character like Stifler, person who we may have seen and hated in high school. He not only provided the most laughs of them all, but was never a caricatured cliché. In "American Wedding", Stifler becomes a shell of his former self and seems to act more retarded than funny you end up getting the impression that there are a few screws loose somewhere about him. Seriously, he acts the whole time like he needs a mental health evaluation. Sure he's on quite a lot which is fine because I really enjoyed his character over the years, but in "American Wedding" his comical intentions are not featured here.To conclude, "American Wedding" will appeal to some, but not to this film critic. I'll just have to pass on this. I saw it once and I think to me that's enough.

SPOILER!!!! I don't understand how any film maker could let it slide.  I don't understand how any producer could let it go.  I don't understand how any audience member could accept it.....WHY DID A**HOLE STIFLER GET THE GIRL IN THE END???   That doesn't make any sense!  Poor Finchy gets treated to an ending almost exactly like the one in Pie 2!!  Stifler's mom shows up out of nowhere and gives him a happy(?)cop-out ending??? Am I the only one that wanted Finch to get the girl?What does this teach the horny teenage boys watching?  The bigger prick you are the more likely you'll be to get the girl?  And "apparently" young women are too stupid to see through this!   Insulting all around.Next...why wouldn't Jim use the garbage for his trimmings?  Does he also cross an entire other room to throw other bathroom "refuse" out the window? I get that it wouldn't be a joke without the window...it  was just poorly thought out...   The first American Pie movie was fun.  The second more of the same, but okay....the third was INSULTING CRAP!!

I loved the first american pie, but was so dissapointed with the second. it was too direct, lacked creativity, and got old. (sorry to anyone who loved it). but ii was delightfully surprised with American Wedding. The sexual jokes flowed much better, it was all situational as opposed to 'hahaha look at my wang', and in general just got more laughs. It is a great movie to see in the theater while your in the mood for something like that, and a lot of fun. although half the original cast is now gone, the remaining few are a good mix for the last of the american pie trilogy. stifler is kinda crazy and unbearable in the beginning but bear with it, it eventually works with the story and gets better. This is such a cute movie.. and yes i use the word cute. Its hilarious, but not so over the top that it looses the sweetness of it, being the fact that the main point of this movie is the wedding of jim and michelle. What a great, mindless piece of entertainment!

Yeah, so if you liked the first two as much as I did, you'll probably fin this movie fun and entertaining. Here's the thing though, it's not really an AP movie. The movie isn't about bro-mance, and it's not even REALLY about Jim, Keven, Chris, and Finch, it's about Stiffler. You can say whatever you want about how it's the wedding of Jim and Michele so it's about them but it's not. The majority of screen time is given to Stiffler and his antics which is too bad, because Sean William Scott can't carry a movie very well, and he because old and annoying quickly. This being said the movie has a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, and, yes, bestiality jokes. The main problem is that it is not original, or even really an AP movie. American Wedding is pretty much a slightly raunchier rom-com. I was let down a great deal by this movie, even though I liked it. I'm a huge Alyson Hannigan fan, so I was excited to see her as a lead, and had she have ACTUALLY been the lead, alongside Jason Biggs, the movie would have been much better. It's also not really an AP movie because it's not a bromance, and where the heck is Chris?! So yeah, watch it and enjoy it if you like the first two AP's, but don't expect anything as good as the first two. Basically, it should have been a bromantic comedy not a romantic comedy, and it's American Wedding, not American Stiffler.

American Pie works best as its own entity. It was a tight story in which each character was able to maintain his or her own story arch. Would Jim overcome his fumbling, goofy nature and lack of confidence and rise to the occasion with Nadia? Would Oz be able to pull off his facade as superficial jock to sentimental choir boy? Would Kevin, the only character in an establish relationship, be able to take the relationship to the next level? And just what was Finch up to? In defense of the people behind American Wedding, they simply did not have the necessary tools at their disposal to pull off a fulfilling third slice in the American Pie trilogy. In fact, signs of diminished resources were apparent by the second film-- and I am talking not merely about the absence of some of the key actors to reprise their role (which hurts this film greatly), but more importantly, there simply was not enough for these once central characters to do.The strongest apparent example is Kevin, who, without any side plot whatsoever, is left with nothing to do but stand around and throw around toasts "to the next step." His character could have been completely removed from this film without it having any impact.Of course, the other problem is that the absence of the complete ensemble (or even a mention as to what became of them), strikes at the friends-to-the-end theme of these American Pie movies. Who though, at the conclusion of the original American Pie, that if some day in the not-too-distant future Jim was getting married, Oz would not be in attendance. It rings hollow.

This is the third installment in the life of Jim Levenstein and his friends. "American Wedding" seems to point out there will be follow up movies perhaps. Why not? This formula has produced three films and could "American Children", "American Divorce", "American Single Dad", etc. will be too far behind? Jesse Dylan directs this one.The film is typical of the gross movie genre. The only excuse to watch this one is Seann William Scott, who as the obnoxious Steve Stifler, is at his nastiest self in the film. Stifler has great moments, such as in the sequence involving the rescue of the ring that one of the dogs has have swallowed! Jason Biggs, the groom of the film, seems to be playing second fiddle as Seann William Scott's part was made more important to his own, which in a way is what keeps the film alive because the nerdy Jim doesn't elicit much fun when he shows on screen. Eugene Levy, Fred Willard and Deborah Rush have good moments in the film.Let's just hope the people behind these installments will see the light and put all these characters to rest and give us more of Mr. Scott in his own vehicles.

Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are getting married. We get introduced to Michelle's family (Fred Willard, Deborah Rush, January Jones). The gang is back. Sadly for Jim and Michelle, so is Stifler (Seann William Scott). He insists on butting in on their lives. If only Jim doesn't need Stifler to teach him how to dance.It's one outrageous setup after another. Certainly the humor level is the expected level we've come to love from the previous two movies. There are some missing actors like Chris Klein and the girls. The franchise is resting on much fewer hands. It is mostly Stifler going crazy and embarrassing Jim at every turn. Without the rest of the cast, this is too much Stifler. It becomes a slapstick sitcom with much of the heart missing.

It was lacking some ingrediants, or cast members, but only an AMERICAN PIE movie could make good of that issue.Its had a great soundtrack, like the others It is hard to say which AMERICAN PIE installment is the best cause there all just one outrageous saga. This is a great (supposed) finish to the AMERICAN PIE series. Id say AMERICAN WEDDING had more laughs that both its predeccesors, even though i never thought that would be possible. It also was a little sweeter. Id consider it more of a Wedding cake. if you liked the first one and second, or at least one of those two, u like this one equally or better. AMERICAN WEDDING delivers  a super slice of guilty, raunchy pleasure. You laugh and laugh, and still laugh even the 20th time u watch it...

There's one thing you have to say for `American Wedding': like the two `American Pie' films that came before it, it is unapologetically unashamed of its shamelessness.  Here's a film that doesn't try to hide its gleeful perverseness under a bushel of coy double entendres; instead the film revels in its frank and openhearted treatment of sexuality and lust.  `American Wedding' is clearly a comedy about sex and it doesn't pretend to be anything but.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad will, I suppose, depend on your own affinity and tolerance for jokes and images that routinely push the boundaries of common decency and good taste.  In fact, the film wears its tastelessness almost as a badge of honor.  And just in case you're unfamiliar with this series and its brand of humor, subtlety and wit are not considered virtues in an `American Pie' world.In `American Wedding,' Jim and Michelle - he a self-described pervert and she a self-described nympho - have finally agreed to tie the knot.  The film centers around Jim's attempts to convince Michelle's square, uptight, sexually repressed parents that he is indeed husband material for their less-than-innocent daughter.  The problem is that his efforts are consistently being undermined by the inane, out-of-control antics of Steve Stifler, the foulest-mouthed, dirtiest-minded professional adolescent this side of Bluto Blutarsky.  Seann William Scott, in fact, steals the show as Stifler, providing an over-the-top manic energy that is both endearing and infectious.Indeed, without Stifler, there would be precious little to recommend this particular `American' outing.  The jokes and setups, for the most part, are crude and graphic without being very imaginative, and writer Adam Herz and director Jesse Dylan, even when they hit on an inspired piece of silliness (as when Stiffler winds up dancing mano a mano with a guy in a gay bar), end up diluting the humor by letting the scenes drag on well past the point where they're truly funny anymore.   This is not to say that there aren't a few good laughs in `American Wedding,' just that they don't come often enough to really lift the film much above the ordinary.  Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie.  In the film's defense, I would also add that, like its two predecessors and unlike many sexually charged teen comedies, `American Wedding' conveys a certain affection for its characters.  In addition to Stifler, Jason Biggs as Jim and Eugene Levy as Jim's befuddled but strangely tolerant and supportive father come across as decent, well-meaning and likable individuals.The film itself may be uneven, but as a character actor who makes an indelible impression on the material at hand, Scott is the genuine article. He transforms what is essentially cinematic rotgut into sweet-tasting vintage wine.  All hail the Stifman!

Although it was a bad movie, it was fun to watch.I wouldn't recommend it, but I would also recommend it, if you want to have fun.

The gangs back together, and now there having to cope with life after college (sadly Oz, Heather, Nadia, Jessica and Vicki have all moved on, oh! and the shermanator 'but He'll Be Back! in Band Camp; but that's another story) So with a new environment and only half the original cast, how does the third in the series shape up? I'm glad to say that it still carry's on the Pie tradition, Jim still finds himself in the most embarrassing of situations, Stiffler's still hell bent on one thing and Jim's dad is still offering his own unique brand of advice to anyone who'll listen.Overall the gags are lacking the freshness they once had, but with some new characters and some great comedy scenes the American Pie hasn't quite crumbled yet.7/10

While it has it's share of terrific scenes and Seann William Scott is a comic genius - American Pie - The Wedding (which it's known as here in Australia) isn't quite as good as the first two. The reason seems to be that things seem much more contrived this time out, and not as spontaneous as the original was. The highlight is obviously the bachelor party scene which has some great moments for Finch, Stifler and Jim, but there aren't as many laughs as in the first two, which is a shame. Add to this a dull opening act (things don't get going until Stifler enters the scene) and lots of filler where not much really goes on, American Pie - The Wedding is a good but not great, possible end to a nonetheless fine comedy series. But here's hoping that Stifler and the rest of the team have one more of these in them, because they're such appealing movies even when they're not laugh-out-loud funny.

Let me start by saying that I am passionately in love with Seann William Scott. I think he's one of the finest pieces of man ever to grace the screen, for so many reasons.Secondly, I'm a huge, HUGE fan of both American Pie I and II. I could watch both of them over and over again, and have, as a matter of fact.But American Wedding SUCKED. It felt hollow, empty, and painful. It was like watching a former beauty queen drunkenly struggle into a pair of too-tight pantyhose. There was no dignity about this movie, no joy, no lighter-than-air charm. What happened to all the strong, delightful females? What happened to Oz? Nobody even mentions him. How sad, and what an unforgivable oversight.Even my beloved SWS came across as gimmicky and self-conscious. Stifler isn't endearing anymore; the actor knows he's a hot commodity, and that all eyes are on him. Quite frankly, he buckles under the pressure. (I'm sorry, Seannie, but it's how I feel).I came away from this movie feeling quite forlorn. I'd been expecting so much, but received so little. Even the audio commentary with SWS did nothing to allay my blues, because he ends up sounding like nothing more than a typical San Fernando Valley "like, ya know, oh man, dude, kinda like"...doofus.Sigh. I've heard he's a doll in real life. And maybe he's a pistol in the sack. We can only hope.

I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because for a comedy it made me laugh continuously.  Not a minute was wasted.  Even if the situation was totally absurd, as many were, the conviction of the actors in their roles was enough to keep it going.  Stiffler and Finch's rivalry reached new highs and lows in this one as they compete for the affections of Michelles virgin little sister Cadence.  Fred Willards addition in this third movie was welcome, even if his role was subtle.I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie. The plots were simple but believable.. How complex can a wedding story be anyways.  It made sense, it was funny, it was definately funnier than the second american pie movie.. im not going to say it was funnier than the first but I definately laughed longer and harder in this one.  Well done. Plus Alyson Hannigan is somehow getting hotter as the movies progress.

Not quite at previous heights but more than enough laughs to make this worthwhile!

American Wedding is the weakest of the series but its still very funny and very enjoyable to watch. Jim and Michelle are getting married and Jim wants nothing wrong to happen. Stifler is going to the wedding against the wishes of Jim and Michelle. He is more interested in Cadence who is Michelle's sister and one of her bridesmaids. The wedding is close and there are a lot of things left to do. However, some of the wedding plans go wrong and it looks like this wedding is going to be a disaster, Can Jim pull it together and make it through the wedding? The plot is interesting as one of the guys get married. With this type of film though, the plot is a non issue. People who see this type of movie just want to have a good laugh and they won't be disappointed. The bets thing about this sequel is defiantly Stifler. Sean William Scott gives a really funny performance and pretty much carries this film. He goes over the top sometimes but for the most part he is pretty good. Jason Biggs gives a god performance as Jim. He is pretty much the same as the first two films so if you liked him before then you will like him again. Alyson Hannigan plays Michelle and I find her character really annoying and not funny. Eddie Kaye Thomas does an okay job as Finch, he just isn't as funny as he is in the previous films. Thomas Ian Nicholas plays Kevin and he is sort of just there. He doesn't do anything memorable his character is kind of countless at times. Eugene Levy is back as Jim's dad and he gives a funny performance. Compared to the first two though, its not as strong. January Jones plays Cadence and does a really bad job. If she wasn't pretty then she probably wouldn't be in Hollywood. Fred Willard and Deborah Rush play Michelle's parents. They both are very funny and nice additions to the cast. Missing from the film this time around are Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Natasha Lyonne and Mena Suvari. They are not missed and their characters wouldn't really feel right in this film either. James B. Rogers directs and does a good job. The jokes in the film may be funny but they are not as good as the first two. Its surprising how good this film turned out to be as the second sequel is usually stale and bad. Running time is 106 minutes with the directors cut and it's the version you should see. The movie is also a bit more serious at times then the other two. This isn't a bad thing but its just a little different mood then expected. In the end, this is a very funny sequel that's worth checking out. Rating 7.2/10

American Wedding is the funniest film in the American Pie series. Most of the original gang is back to see Jim and Michelle tie the knot. But, the two characters have to overcome a couple of obstacles. One obstacle is making sure Stifler behaves himself. Does he... not really. Stifler throws a bachelor party when Michelle's parents are supposed to turn up, eats dog crap while saying it's chocolate, losing the ring, and having sex with Jim's grandmother. Stifler is by far the most funniest character in the film, especially when he plays nice boy. Jim and his father are funny, too. I liked the part when Jim shaves his privates and throws the shavings out the window and into people's mouths and wedding cake. The characters are original and hilarious. The acting was great, so was the directing. As with the first two films, there is a great soundtrack. I recommend seeing this grand finale. I rate this film a 10/10.

So, here we are then with the third installment of the American Pie series. The first one was a refreshing take on the teen comedy. I'm not a massive fan of the genre, but thanks to good writing and interesting characters, the film worked. The second one was more of the same, but in spite of that it still managed to be entertaining enough to be considered 'good'. This third part again can be considered 'more of the same', except this time there's a wedding theme and, thankfully, the writers have isolated the dead wood from the other two films and dropped it. The dumb jock, Mena Suvari (good actress, crap character), Kevin's girlfriend...you get the point, have been dropped. This leaves us to concentrate on the more interesting characters - Jim, obviously but more notably Stifler, Finch and Jim's dad; who are the real stars of the series anyway. As usual, they're the ones that are relied on to bring in the laughs, and they do it to the standard that you'd expect. None of them are quite as funny as they have been and Stifler's character seems to have become more outrageous, rather than keeping in with what's gone before...but who cares in a film like this? Character coherency isn't too much of an issue anyway.The central theme of the wedding is how most of the jokes come about, and it creates four big set-pieces; two of which work, and two of which don't. Seeing Stifler dancing in a gay bar is hilarious and sure to delight everyone that sees the film, but even funnier than that is the part where Stifler hires two exotic dancers to 'entertain' the boys...at the same time that Jim has invited Michele's parents round for a 'chat'...oops! The two that don't work are more disgusting than funny...and I'm sure you'll see which parts I mean upon seeing the movie. As you might expect from the conclusion (hopefully!) of a series and one that sees two of it's characters tie the knot, there's a degree of sentiment here; but it does work, and it's even kind of nice to see after watching the characters 'develop' (somewhat, anyway) over the last two films.American Wedding is a decent comedy, and one that I would recommend to anyone that liked the other two films.

First of, let's talk about the 1st 2 movies, they both successfully followed the same continuous rhythm with pretty much the same characters but each had their own uniqueness and addition to the story and characters development.But this one was so confused! first of all, there were too much focus on Stifler's character; which is weird and too much since the previous 2 movies had solid plots for each and every member of the gang, making this element a key factor to why American Pie is so relatable and light-heartedly represents the good old high-school gang with various characters and views but they still stick together.How about Michelle's character? it barely had any presence and pretty much zero character development -which is weird since the whole movie should be about a wedding in which she is the bride-.To sum it all up, it was a movie about Stifler trying to impress parents and to hook up with a confused girl. And it just DRAGGED ON, trying too much to recreate the funny awkwardness that the first 2 movies were characterized by, but it was too heavy and unnatural, it didn't have any flow to it.

Despite an embarrassing scene at a restaurant, Jim proposes to his long-time girlfriend Michelle.  For their wedding Jim enlists the help of Finch and Kevin to make everything smooth  and keep Stifler out of the way.  However a ceremony is hard work and is made harder when things just always seem to go wrong and when Stifler seems to be determined to f**k the bride's sister  even if it means pretending to be mild mannered and polite.Trying to think about this film or the series itself is like trying to argue with mud, basically you just need to accept that this is a silly, stupid gross out comedy that relies on poor taste jokes and unlikely set ups.  If this is a problem for you then don't watch it.  If you have accepted it and are watching it then it all comes down to, is it a GOOD gross out comedy with poor taste jokes?  As much as I know I should be above it, I did laugh at the other 2 films and was happy to go and see this and, for the most part, I laughed at this.  However this was the weakest of the three and the silence in the cinema was quite often uncomfortable  usually silence in a cinema is a good thing, but this was often an uncomfortable `I should be laughing more' type of silence.In my review of part 2 I said `lets not do a 3'.  Watching this I'm sort of glad they managed to do it but I can see the strain despite their best efforts.  The main set up sequences are gross and funny but the gaps between are where the silence comes, there ain't enough comedy to cover the whole film.  I'm not talking about the sweet stuff near the end, I just talking about all the scenes between the banner scenes.  Plus the sequences are very forced at times (many you can see coming for miles), but this isn't too bad as they still manage to be hilariously gross!  For those who like the nudity (and who didn't like the bi-sexual teasing scene from part 2?) there is a long sequence of strippers with large fake breasts, if that's your thing (I'm a man, so yes!) which is funny but also serves up the mandatory t&a. There are also some scenes that are TOO forced  eg the dance in the gay bar is funny but is too long and feels like a good idea with average delivery.The film bravely loses something like half the cast and makes the film better in that regard.  In fact Kevin has so little to do that they could have lost his character all together.  However this is offset by the change to Stifler.  In the first 2 he is obnoxious and rude but he is also the brunt of more jokes than he is the punisher.  In the first half here, he is very rude and annoying and you hate him for how he treats his friends.  That makes all his early antics hard to laugh at because now all you can see is a jerk hurting people.  In the second half this is less of an issue as he changes a little and gets what's coming to him (and how!).  I have a theory that Scott knows he has been pigeon holed in this role and is desperate to get out of it  in fact when I saw Bullet Proof Monk I did think to myself that he is just playing a kung-fu Stifler.  Knowing this I think he played Stifler at full volume so that his next role would be nowhere near this performance.  Thus he has a weird crazed sneer on his face, he is ultra cruel and rude and is a real jerk  hard to laugh with (but luckily still easy to laugh at).The rest of the cast do quite well.  Biggs manages to make more of his role than the victim and is sensitive when he needs to be  I think it will be hard for him to shake off Jim (pardon the pun) but he shows he can do acting when he needs to.  Hannigan's innocent girlie voice is a little grating now and doesn't sit with her image as a woman  it suited her to be a geek. Luckily she doesn't have that much to do after the funny opening scene. Thomas is OK but Nicholas just kind of hangs around with a half smile of his face and nothing to do.  Levy is still brillant as Jim's Dad but misses his `awkward moment' relationship (which they give him with Michelle to repeat it).  Jones is eye candy and the return of Stifler's Mon (forget her name) is pointless and a mistake that is happily kept to a few moments.Overall this is as poor a film as you expect  rude, in poor taste, lacking a strong plot or performances, but none of these things are really fair comments as the film still manages to be funny.  The character of Stifler makes the first half very hard to enjoy and there are too many bits that don't work or where I didn't laugh but I still laughed.  Many viewers will feel that the series has simply fizzled out despite it still being funny.

"American Wedding" is a still good and original comedy but it unfortunately never comes close to the high level of the previous two American Pie movies. There are several explanations to why this is.The first thing is because of the formula that already has been milked out a bit now in the previous two movies. All the freshness is gone and because of that the movie also becomes predictable at times.Second thing are the characters. For some reason the characters don't work out as good as in the previous two movies. They are not in college any more and they're no longer teenagers and are now part of the normal everyday society. The normal world doesn't exactly suit the characters and they work better in a teenage college environment. The characters had been changed a bit too much to fit into this movie with as a result that they are less funny and especially the sidekicks get very little interesting to do in this movie.I'm sounding negative but it still is a good and enjoyable movie that has some well conceived moments in it that are good for some serious laughs. Also what makes this comedy better than the average movie is the Stifler character played by Seann William Scott. He brings real life to the movie and his character is even more prominently present as in the previous two movies. His character truly carries the movie and is the main reason why this movie is a fun one to watch, even though compared to the first two American Pie movies it isn't nearly as good and fresh.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

I don't know if it is due to the change of director or something else but this sequel to the legendary series morphed into a romantic comedy. The original cast is reduced and most of the characters except Jim and Stifler lost their vibes. The film is overwhelmed with romance, and the raunchiness does not go well. However, it is still watchable for American Pie fans.

American Wedding is a decent conclusion to the American Pie trilogy, although several characters from the first two films are sorely missing in this one (including Chris Klein). However, unlike the second film, this one is as original as the first film, with the main focus being the wedding between Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan as Jim and Michelle. Joining the cast again are Seann William Scott as the funny Stifler and a hilarious Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. Jennifer Coolidge also again makes an always hilarious cameo as Stifler's mom. Another thing to point out, all 3 films were either written or co-written by Adam Herz, thereby bringing a cohesive glue between all 3 films (which would otherwise be lacking if different writers handled all 3 films). A still funny 7 out of 10.

SPOILER!!!! I don't understand how any film maker could let it slide.  I don't understand how any producer could let it go.  I don't understand how any audience member could accept it.....WHY DID A**HOLE STIFLER GET THE GIRL IN THE END???   That doesn't make any sense!  Poor Finchy gets treated to an ending almost exactly like the one in Pie 2!!  Stifler's mom shows up out of nowhere and gives him a happy(?)cop-out ending??? Am I the only one that wanted Finch to get the girl?What does this teach the horny teenage boys watching?  The bigger prick you are the more likely you'll be to get the girl?  And "apparently" young women are too stupid to see through this!   Insulting all around.Next...why wouldn't Jim use the garbage for his trimmings?  Does he also cross an entire other room to throw other bathroom "refuse" out the window? I get that it wouldn't be a joke without the window...it  was just poorly thought out...   The first American Pie movie was fun.  The second more of the same, but okay....the third was INSULTING CRAP!!

May be a SPOILER for some:
To me i thought this movie was mostly about stifler, i mean most of the movie showed him screwing up and making the wedding even more difficult although he did manage to fix up some of his mistakes and do some helpful chores:Screwups: Walked into the gay bar trying to find leslie summers, insulted leslie's friends and then started the whole dance competition.set up the bachelor party at Jims house when Jim was about to have the special talk with Michelles parents.accidentally fed the wedding band to the Michelles parents dogsate dog poopKilled all the wedding flowersscrewed Jims grandmaHelpful:motivated the florist to set up more flowersand taught Jim to dance.
Overall Stifler took up most of the movie, it was still great

Yeah, so if you liked the first two as much as I did, you'll probably fin this movie fun and entertaining. Here's the thing though, it's not really an AP movie. The movie isn't about bro-mance, and it's not even REALLY about Jim, Keven, Chris, and Finch, it's about Stiffler. You can say whatever you want about how it's the wedding of Jim and Michele so it's about them but it's not. The majority of screen time is given to Stiffler and his antics which is too bad, because Sean William Scott can't carry a movie very well, and he because old and annoying quickly. This being said the movie has a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, and, yes, bestiality jokes. The main problem is that it is not original, or even really an AP movie. American Wedding is pretty much a slightly raunchier rom-com. I was let down a great deal by this movie, even though I liked it. I'm a huge Alyson Hannigan fan, so I was excited to see her as a lead, and had she have ACTUALLY been the lead, alongside Jason Biggs, the movie would have been much better. It's also not really an AP movie because it's not a bromance, and where the heck is Chris?! So yeah, watch it and enjoy it if you like the first two AP's, but don't expect anything as good as the first two. Basically, it should have been a bromantic comedy not a romantic comedy, and it's American Wedding, not American Stiffler.

American Pie works best as its own entity. It was a tight story in which each character was able to maintain his or her own story arch. Would Jim overcome his fumbling, goofy nature and lack of confidence and rise to the occasion with Nadia? Would Oz be able to pull off his facade as superficial jock to sentimental choir boy? Would Kevin, the only character in an establish relationship, be able to take the relationship to the next level? And just what was Finch up to? In defense of the people behind American Wedding, they simply did not have the necessary tools at their disposal to pull off a fulfilling third slice in the American Pie trilogy. In fact, signs of diminished resources were apparent by the second film-- and I am talking not merely about the absence of some of the key actors to reprise their role (which hurts this film greatly), but more importantly, there simply was not enough for these once central characters to do.The strongest apparent example is Kevin, who, without any side plot whatsoever, is left with nothing to do but stand around and throw around toasts "to the next step." His character could have been completely removed from this film without it having any impact.Of course, the other problem is that the absence of the complete ensemble (or even a mention as to what became of them), strikes at the friends-to-the-end theme of these American Pie movies. Who though, at the conclusion of the original American Pie, that if some day in the not-too-distant future Jim was getting married, Oz would not be in attendance. It rings hollow.

I loved the first american pie, but was so dissapointed with the second. it was too direct, lacked creativity, and got old. (sorry to anyone who loved it). but ii was delightfully surprised with American Wedding. The sexual jokes flowed much better, it was all situational as opposed to 'hahaha look at my wang', and in general just got more laughs. It is a great movie to see in the theater while your in the mood for something like that, and a lot of fun. although half the original cast is now gone, the remaining few are a good mix for the last of the american pie trilogy. stifler is kinda crazy and unbearable in the beginning but bear with it, it eventually works with the story and gets better. This is such a cute movie.. and yes i use the word cute. Its hilarious, but not so over the top that it looses the sweetness of it, being the fact that the main point of this movie is the wedding of jim and michelle. What a great, mindless piece of entertainment!

After the release of "American Pie II", a major milestone came into effect that rarely has ever been done before. It was great to see a sequel actually produced more laughs than the original "American Pie". This is thanks mainly by producer Chris Moore and producer Adam Herz. The sequel provided more sympathy for the characters; you get a better understanding of their personality traits and their behavioural patterns in a clearer picture. In addition to that it was purely comical.Sadly though, the third instalment to the series "American Wedding" failed to live up to the expectations of the previous two films. Partially because a lot of the cast members from the original two movies are nowhere to be found, which is not particularly a bad thing because Oz (Chris Klein), Vicky (Tara Reid) and Heather (Mena Suvari) were never really that appealing to me? But still Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) was greatly missed. What really made this sequel really disappointing was that the characters have been badly demoted to wooden clichés of themselves. Sue the series was saturated with crude, rude and lewd jokes and I guess it's just not right to pull away from that tradition by continuing where they left off as opposed to adding new and original humour. So now we see another situation where Jim finds himself at another disadvantage involving his genitals. In the second instalment, Stifler gets urinated on, so it comes to no surprise that the third instalment feces will come into play here. I guess my rant is that the routines that follow tend to be too tiring and predictable.If the absence of characters from the other two movies wasn't appalling or the tiring routines that follow from the other two instalments, the ultimate letdown in "American Wedding" is the character of Stifler (Sean William Scott). I mean of the series, Stifler was one of the funnier supporting characters in the whole series. Mr. Herz really outdid himself when he created a character like Stifler, person who we may have seen and hated in high school. He not only provided the most laughs of them all, but was never a caricatured cliché. In "American Wedding", Stifler becomes a shell of his former self and seems to act more retarded than funny you end up getting the impression that there are a few screws loose somewhere about him. Seriously, he acts the whole time like he needs a mental health evaluation. Sure he's on quite a lot which is fine because I really enjoyed his character over the years, but in "American Wedding" his comical intentions are not featured here.To conclude, "American Wedding" will appeal to some, but not to this film critic. I'll just have to pass on this. I saw it once and I think to me that's enough.

If you watch the Unrated DVD of "American Wedding" check out the "writer's commentary." I just assumed this was a new writer who was brought in after the guys who did "American Pie I & II" got tired of this. Not so -- incredibly, the same guy wrote all three! This is a tired movie -- it should be entitled "The Stifler Compromise" because, really, it's all about the writer's obvious love for the Stifler character who grows old and weary after 5 minutes. He's kind of like the funny friend you remember from junior high who never grew up. Do you really want to see 90 minutes of  Stifler jerking around like an idiot, screeching potty mouth language and trying desperately to be funny? For some reason Ebert gave this a good review and I can't figure that out. The scene he cited as hilarious -- Stifler on the gay disco -- was dumb and pathetic. And this is from a guy who thought the first "American Pie" was and is a classic!Pass on this. Save the dough and watch "Napoleon Dynamite" instead!
