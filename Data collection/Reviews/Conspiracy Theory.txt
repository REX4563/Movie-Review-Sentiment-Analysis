I found this film really hard to focus on, there was Mel Gibson playing a paranoid crazy guy, being dragged off by government/non-government 'spooks' and having some sort of weird obsession with Julia Roberts.  But as the film unfolded, and the storyline, a complex one, began to unravel it all started to make some kind of sense.  My favorite part has to be the self destruction of his apartment, that was quite imaginative.  Before I saw this i was expecting something along the lines of Lethal Weapon, being the same star, and same director.  But it was so completely different from what I thought it would be and it actually ended up being a better film as a consequence. Mel Gibson played a completely different character than what we usually see, which worked to his benefit and Julia Roberts proved with this film, that she still had star power.  Definitely worth a look.

When I picked up this video for a couple of bucks I'd never heard of it, and Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts don't seem a likely pair. I was therefore pleasantly surprised by the film. It has heart, decent performances, especially by Gibson who plays against type, an interesting story, quite a few surprises, and for anyone who loves a good conspiracy this presents one. I've seen it several times and it always entertains. Definitely worth a look.

Mel Gibson is most sympathetic as conspiracy theorist Jerry Fletcher, who lives in a ultra-secure, booby trapped apartment where he publishes his newsletter critical of the government. Ironically, he loves government employee Alice Sutton(played by Julia Roberts) from afar. One day, their worlds collide when one of Jerry's theories seems to be true, as he becomes the target of assassination, and Alice helps him to go on the run from the unknown government forces. He thinks that Dr. Jonas(Patrick Stewart) will help him, but it turns out that was one conspiracy he didn't anticipate...Entertaining thriller is well directed by Richard Donner, with a good pace and reasonably believable story, though it does go on a bit too long, and becomes a bit too convoluted, but otherwise this film works well, and some of Jerry's theories may not be so nutty anymore...

Richard Donner's 'Conspiracy Theory' isn't without its share of interesting moments & has a solid cast that deliver, but overall, its an uneven!

Unfortunately, in order to save himself, he has to figure out which theory it is.'Conspiracy Theory' begins tepidly, I wasn't engaged in its initial moments at all. However, the film grows on you gradually & maintains a certain pace till the very end.

Julia Roberts is sensational. She shines all through. Sir Patrick Stewart has never been so creepy before. He nails the part of the evil villain. On the whole, 'Conspiracy Theory' ranges from being good to strictly average. At best, A One-Time Watch!

This movie is worth watching to get a good laugh at the kooks that go around believing all this nonsense. You all know one. Maybe you are one. They, like Jerry (Mel Gibson), can find the most outrageous explanations for their beliefs. But, as Jerry says: "A good conspiracy is unprovable. I mean, if you can prove it, it means they screwed up somewhere along the line." How convenient! Julia Roberts, who had not had a hit since The Pelican Beif when she did this, went on to greater fame in Notting Hill and Erin Brocovich. She really played a classy role and kept the lid on Mel, who seemed like he was going to explode at any minute.Patrick Stewart was perfectly cast as the evil Government operative who was out of control.

Now this movie is just brilliant. It is exactly the type of movie that I just love. There so much happening in the background and you are never sure what really is happening. The theme of this movie is "the truth will set you free", but what really is the truth. The movie leads you to believe one thing and then confronts you with something that destroys everything the you had built up, only to knock this down as well.What really is true? You will never know. You follow the main character through out the movie – and this character really knows a lot. On the outside he appears to be a nut with all of these conspiracy theories but then a layer is pealed off to reveal a little more about this character. What does this character really know? Who is he – well the movie may tell you, or it may not.You know who the bad guy is, or is he really the bad guy. The only certainty is Julia Roberts' character. She seems to be legit, or is she. Yes I am being ambiguous for this is the whole aspect of this movie. Ambiguity reigns and as you dig deeper in to look for the truth, the more questions that are raised.As such this movie is brilliant. It is in the similar vein to the Usual Suspects. It creates a story only to tear it down and leaving you wondering what happened. It is the ultimate conspiracy theory. The conspiracies that Mel Gibson's character brings out seem to be ultimately wild – yet they do seem to make sense.Mel Gibson's character is brilliant. He is like a child with huge amounts of knowledge. At first is appears to be a simple cab driver with a tonne of wild ideas; and then the layers of his character begin to be peeled off. What does he really know? The character doesn't know the answer to this question. One thing that is very definite is that he really brings out patterns. He can see a pattern in almost everything and the patterns he pulls out really makes one think – are these really conspiracies.One brilliant aspect of the movie are the little tricks and gadgets that are used. They do not dominate the movie; but they are there to show us how intelligent this character really is. The Firewall and the Beer Bomb are two examples. The beer bomb is where a bottle is balanced on the door knob and when the knob is turn the bottle breaks. The firewall is a much more brilliant thing for it will utterly destroy the apartment without damaging anything else. If it is brilliant and clever tricks that you are looking for then this is a movie to see.Patrick Stewart plays the bad guy – or is he a bad guy. Stewart is a brilliant actor; unfortunately his seven year stint in Star Trek has dulled his edge. When I see Stewart on the screen I immediately think of Captain Picard. This, to me, can really destroy a really good actor. Mel Gibson is seen as Mel Gibson; Julia Roberts is seen as Julia Roberts; but one cannot help seeing Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-luc Picard. There was one gripe I had with the movie, but I cannot tell you because if I did it would spoil it. It is one the really would have made it absolutely brilliant; but in a fallen world nothing is brilliant.Remember the words of the movie – "the truth will set you free."

The thing that stands out for me in this movie is the wonderful (and underrated) performance given by Mel Gibson.  His part calls for an uneasy balance between a paranoid psychotic and romantic leading man and he treds that fine line beautifully.  Despite all his craziness, he is totally likeable and his relationship with the Julia Roberts character is wonderfully complex and believable.  Julia Roberts also gives an excellent performance and the chemistry between the two leads is perfect.All in all, I loved this film and didn't understand why it was so underrated by the critics.

When you consider that Mel Gibson, the chip himself, and Julia Roberts, another classically overrated Hollywood actor, star in this movie, you have to be very wary. They both regularly produce very average movies with very average performances. This was one reason why I was a little surprised by this movie. I quite enjoyed the idea as I think most people do of a conspiracy theory, no matter how far fetched it may be.Mel is a very capable actor, just a bitter individual who lets his emotions take control of the truth. This was one of the few recent movies he's been associated with where he has remained fairly neutral. Julia Roberts was also performing at the higher end of her acting capabilities, and because of this was not a distraction of disappointment which is so commonly a feature of her performances.It's nothing to get excited about, but easy viewing for a quiet night in.

Conspiracy Theory is a fairly good movie, it's entertaining sure but it did tend to drag in parts for me and felt inconsistent as a whole. Mel Gibson's crazy performance waffles between brilliance and just plain over-the-top and I had a hard time believing any part of the romancy thing going on between him and Julia Roberts as he was just a little too certifiable for anyone to fall for. And while the whole conspiracy theory/Manchurian Candidate aspect was super interesting there were also sections explaining this storyline that just went on too long and ended up being really boring. Enjoyed Patrick Stewart as the bad guy 08.13

I've always been a fan of Conspiracy Theories so I figured I would check this one out,, it's above average,, based on the acting between our stars, Mel Gibson, Julia Robert,, and Patrick Stewart,, I was hoping for an actual conspiracy,, instead we get the old,, CIA, mind control stuff, rogue killer programmed to assassinate someone,, which isn't that bad, but some of the theories in the movie like the Oliver Stone --George Bush one,, I was like wow OK.. Mel's character, Jerry Fletcher is majorly paranoid, insanely crazy as one of his theories actually turns out to be true, problem for him is as he has so many now he has to figure out which theory he is right about,, he get's help from a young lady he saved from a mugging 6 months ago,, so he is like her guardian angel so to speak,, very interesting movie,, once you get by all the covert military mind control stuff.

This movie could be classified into different genres - suspense, romance & thriller.  Not many films can say that, or if they can, many do not succeed. Conspiracy Theory, however, did.The first time I saw this, I was on the edge of my seat.  It was very suspensful.  I won't go into details if you haven't seen it, but it's really one of the best suspense films I've seen.This wasn't a completely romantic film, no.  In fact, I wish it would've touched on the romance more than it did.  Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts had great chemistry.  Although nothing really happened between them, the audience could clearly see Jerry's (Mel Gibson)love for Alice (Julia Roberts.)Now, the plot.  Jerry Fletcher has many wild conspiracy theories - including one that NASA is trying to kill the President with earthquakes.  He's a cabbie & tells lots of people his ideas.  But the one person he seems to tell the most to and thinks can help him is Alice Sutton, an attorney.  He saved her months before the movie takes place when she was mugged.  He seems to get on her nerves, but she puts up with him.  He goes to her office all the time.  He's obviously in love with her, but she doesn't feel the same way.  Well, somehow "they" (CIA, FBI, you know "they") find out about Jerry's crazy conspiracies & they go after him.  He and Alice are in danger.The acting in this movie was terrific.  This may be Mel's best.  His portrayal of a crazy cabbie was so good and believable.  It's not really like any other role he has played.  He did it so well & the audience sympathized with him completely.  Julia was good too.  Her role wasn't really difficult to play, but she made it believably nevertheless. Patrick Stewart also stars in this.  He made a great bad guy.Overall, this movie was great.  It was very suspensful & the acting was outstanding.

Conspiracy Theory is a 1997 thriller that centers around Jerry (Mel Gibson), a spaced-out taxi driver, and his relationship with Alice (Julia Roberts), a Justice Dept lawyer. Jerry drives tons of passengers around (pre-Uber) in his cab spouting all sorts of conspiracy theories to them about anything you can imagine. He's whacky - or is he.As the film proceeds, you learn he has been building a relationship with Alice, but you are not quite sure why. Gibson plays his role keenly, not revealing too much, other than that his character likes confined spaces - the cab, and his apartment, which is tiny and well fortified.Events happen that bring in the antagonist, Dr Jonas, played beautifully by Patrick Stewart, who looked amazingly old even 20 years ago - or maybe it was makeup. His character seemed to be lifted right out of the film Marathon Man, with Sir Lawrence Olivier, with one very memorable scene in particular.A cat-and-mouse game leads you on a chase, skullduggery, deception, even life and death. The film reveals pretty early on who the bad guys are - that could have been better handled. Otherwise, this was a pretty decent thriller, with Mel Gibson still young enough to pull this off. Julia Roberts was stunning in her role, which reminds me of how terrific she is as an actor. This role allowed her to be much more than a pretty woman with a cute smile. She had to kick some butt, and she does.The film direction is, by necessity, confusing and often dark. Many of the scenes happen at night or in dark places. It was a bit jarring at times, but that supports the struggles that Jerry is going thru as he tries to figure out his life, and as Alice tries to understand the truth.The ending was pretty predictable, and as Hollywood goes, leaves you with a good feeling. It's a worthwhile film that delivers some terrific acting with a decent plot that is Jason Bourne-like in some ways. Enjoy.

As long as there's been man, there's been conspiracies. For example....-Do aliens really exist? -Did man walk on the moon? -Was JFK really shot in the head? -Is Elvis still alive? -Are Phil Smyth's substitution patterns really a secret code he's sending to the Chinese Government?"Conspiracy Theory", starring Mel Gibson (star of "What Women Want") and Julia Roberts (star of "Mystic Pizza"), join forces to star in this movie about a man who is full of conspiracies...and one day seems to stumble upon one that is real. Before long Jerry(Gibson) is running for his life. Luckily he gets some help from a Justice Dept worker, Alice (Roberts), a long time crush and listener to his crackpot theories. It becomes clear though that there's more to this discovery, and the web of mystery becomes an intricate as a spider's web.Not bad, help my interest and got me through a quiet Fri night. Loses points for the woeful score.

Oddly compelling but ultimately absurd tale of man (Gibson) kidnapped for CIA experiment involving mind control for the purpose of committing covertly sanctioned assassinations. His bizarre experience leads him to justice department attorney (Roberts) whose federal judge father (Bert Remsen in flashback) was slain by a brainwashed assassin. But when CIA mind control project boss (Stewart) discovers the potential for the secret to be revealed, he employs covert tactics to prevent the leak.Gibson is way over the top in his portrayal, a babbling nutcase with obsessive compulsive disorder and an extreme persecution complex. Roberts is suitably stony-faced, but just doesn't look convincing in her characterisation. Patrick Stewart is perhaps the most watchable aspect of this film, as the shady and clinically brutal CIA assassin trainer. Special mention to Cylk Cozart as one of trustworthy agents who manages a couple of mild chuckles when he feigns unconsciousness after misguided attempts to knock him out miss the mark.There's simply too many plot holes and contrivances to suspend disbelief for the mammoth two-hour plus duration. It's one of those movies that compels you to hang on in anticipation of some great revelation or moment, alas, it never eventuates. The climax is rushed and disappointing and the film's sing-a-long conclusion is embarrassing. No great shakes, just an immense waste of time.

If you liked PAYBACK and 12 MONKEYS, you will love this film. I have one thing to say about this film... Mel GIbson.  He plays a paranoid, noble, apparent stalker, who has intelligence and wit,but lacks ability to express himself fully.  Can't say more because it might ruin the movie.  CONSPIRACY THEORY IS A MUST SEE.  It ranks in my top 25 category

Basically a formulaic, uneven, overlong conspiracy thriller, despite the occasional quirkiness and some truly intriguing plot twists. Too many flaws and inconsistencies prevent it from being particularly entertaining; some of Gibson's actions are so far-fetched that we can't take this very seriously as a thriller - and it's never clear if we are supposed to or not. Gibson is very good in a difficult, messily written role, and Patrick Stewart gives a calmly effective performance as the villain; on the other hand, Julia Roberts could hardly be more bland - as a result, very little chemistry between her and Gibson is created.   (**1/2)

Mel Gibson gives a great performance here, as well as Julia Roberts! The story is really good, and the movie has some great plot twists. The only thing I disliked was the fact that Patrick Stewart didn't have a bigger role...The movie also has quite some funny moments and lots of action. This definately is one of Richard Donner's best films to date, due especially to the outstanding performance of Mel Gibson! If you haven't seen it yet and if you're looking for an intelligent, well-acted movie, this is the one!

I found this film really hard to focus on, there was Mel Gibson playing a paranoid crazy guy, being dragged off by government/non-government 'spooks' and having some sort of weird obsession with Julia Roberts.  But as the film unfolded, and the storyline, a complex one, began to unravel it all started to make some kind of sense.

Mel Gibson played a completely different character than what we usually see, which worked to his benefit and Julia Roberts proved with this film, that she still had star power.  Definitely worth a look.

This romantic thriller was made over a decade ago, years before I was old enough to watch R-rated movies, and by the time I rented it just yesterday, I still didn't know much about it. However, I did know that the co-stars were Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, two Hollywood movie stars I had been familiar with for a long time. I also knew that it was directed by Richard Donner, who directed the "Lethal Weapon" quadrilogy, which Gibson also co-starred in. I had seen all four of those films, and thought that overall, it was a good franchise. So, I rented "Conspiracy Theory" because I knew it was another film directed by Donner and starring Gibson and it also looked like a promising thriller. Still, I wanted to like it more than I did.Jerry Fletcher is a New York taxi driver and dedicated conspiracy theorist. He can think of conspiracy theories for anything, and constantly talks to his passengers about them. He even writes his theories in his own newsletter, which is sent to only five different people in the mail. The taxi driver has a crush on Alice Sutton, and woman who works for the Justice Department and whose father was murdered, but she doesn't know about Fletcher's feelings towards her. One day, after he is kicked out of Alice's office, he is soon captured by a group of CIA agents and finds himself in a mysterious place where he is tortured by a CIA doctor named Dr. Jonas! This sends Jerry into a fit of insanity, and after he bites the doctor's nose, severely injuring him, he manages to escape from the building. It turns out that at least one of the New York taxi driver's many conspiracy theories appears to be true, but he can't tell which one it is! The beginning shows the main character ranting to various passengers in his cab about his conspiracy theories, and this is a fairly shaky beginning. Soon after that, there's a flashy sequence showing Jerry's frightening memories, and I found this part to be a little rushed and unfocused. A lot of the film can probably be described that way. That part is followed by a cheesy and overlong scene with the taxi driver watching his love interest through her window, singing on her treadmill. Despite all this, it still looks like it's going to be at least a fairly decent thriller around the beginning and it is at times, but it's not consistent enough. The early torture scene didn't do much for me, and it even features frightening memories of Jerry's flashing before his eyes again, with the same problems as the first time this happens. Another thing that doesn't help is that Jerry's constant conspiracy theories can get tiring. Fortunately, there are definitely some good thrills and action, and Mel Gibson puts on an impressive performance as Jerry Fletcher, though his character here is no match for the likable Martin Riggs in the "Lethal Weapon" series. Julia Roberts as Alice Sutton and Patrick Stewart (another actor I've been familiar with for a long time) as Dr. Jonas are also memorable cast highlights.At 135 minutes, this 1997 thriller is a fairly long movie, and later in the film, it didn't seem as flawed to me as it did for a long time before then. It might improve after a while, and Gibson's character might eventually get easier to sympathize with. I may have been worn out during the second half or so, and get the feeling I could have gotten just a BIT more out of the film (at least closer to the end) if I'd had a bit more energy. For that reason, I feel I could almost give it a 7/10 instead of a 6. On the other hand, I don't think having a high energy level would have hidden this movie's severe flaws from me, flaws which make "Conspiracy Theory" somewhat disappointing. Even if it does improve along the way, I would say it definitely takes quite a while to do so. This movie is by no means horrible, and could be entertaining if you like a good romantic thriller and are old enough to see the violence here, but it still didn't meet my expectations.

When I picked up this video for a couple of bucks I'd never heard of it, and Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts don't seem a likely pair. I was therefore pleasantly surprised by the film. It has heart, decent performances, especially by Gibson who plays against type, an interesting story, quite a few surprises, and for anyone who loves a good conspiracy this presents one. I've seen it several times and it always entertains. Definitely worth a look.

Let me say immediately that I would recommend this film to almost anyone but the most literal-minded.  This film will be different things to different people.  It can be a macho thriller, a subtle romance, an ironic look at ourselves, or a combination of all these things.  The great thing about this movie is not so much the plot, but the individual situations and scenes. What is meant to be portrayed as paranoid behaviour by Mel Gibson's character, Jerry Fletcher, becomes quite funny when the viewer recognizes his or her own self doing similar things, but in a context that is supposedly "normal."  Jerry's having a padlock on his refrigerator and a combination lock on his coffee will bring a smile to the lips of anyone who has to deal with numerous computer "logons" and passwords to gain access to even the most mundane things in our computer-dominated workplaces. Likewise, the writers and director are spot on when they show poor paranoid Jerry going to separate mailboxes to post his various letters, while many of us here in the on-line world will routinely use pseudonyms, proxies, remailers, etc for the very same reason that Jerry takes his seemingly abnormal precautions, i.e., to avoid potentially prying eyes.   So, who's paranoid?  I thought this was very insightful.  As for overt humour, perhaps my guard was down, but I laughed until tears came to my eyes when Jerry tossed off joke about a man who had only three minutes to live.  Mel Gibson's delivery of the punch line was perfect.  As for pathos and those human moments, scenes in which Jerry would gladly die for just a brushing kiss from his worshipped Julia Roberts might bring  back memories of anyone's naive, tender years and momentarily make your heart ache.  And a scene in which Jerry is unable to explain why he compulsively buys copies of the same book over and over again is very poignant, indeed.  Mel Gibson put a lot of energy into what was obviously a demanding role and, as usual, Julia Roberts lights up the screen in every scene she's in.  The film might be a fantasy, but it's the sort of fantasy many of us can appreciate.

Mel Gibson is most sympathetic as conspiracy theorist Jerry Fletcher, who lives in a ultra-secure, booby trapped apartment where he publishes his newsletter critical of the government. Ironically, he loves government employee Alice Sutton(played by Julia Roberts) from afar. One day, their worlds collide when one of Jerry's theories seems to be true, as he becomes the target of assassination, and Alice helps him to go on the run from the unknown government forces.

Quite a very good film. It is a thriller and the main character looks and sounds psychotic at least, if not schizophrenic. He definitely speaks of some kind of persecution and he lives right at the heart of a conspiracy and we discover very fast he is the one who is trying to undo it. The film becomes very complex little by little and we are confronted to various security agencies fighting one against the others to capture that man and the main names are CIA and FBI. What makes the film even more complex is that the man is in love, and we know that from the very first moment he is tom-peeping onto her, with the woman who works for the Justice Department, third official security force in the picture. The point is to understand why these people are after him and why he is after the Justice Department to which he wants to speak. What is the secret in that man's head and mind? The film is a perfect thriller because of the action but also because that action is not for itself, for the sake of itself, for its own sake. That action is treacherous because we do not know whether we have to support those official security services or the woman who is kind of an innocent witness trapped in the middle of a mud pile or the man who seems to be justified in a way to run away because of the violence the security services put on the table. The end will be tricky in many ways but the film will remain one more film on the danger of the industrial military complex and the divided loyalties of the security services in such situations. Some of them are after all maybe not so bad. Maybe we can sleep in full peace and in one piece, trusting the faithfulness of some security agents who will reprieve the bad reputation of their agencies.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID

I've always been a fan of Conspiracy Theories so I figured I would check this one out,, it's above average,, based on the acting between our stars, Mel Gibson, Julia Robert,, and Patrick Stewart,, I was hoping for an actual conspiracy,, instead we get the old,, CIA, mind control stuff, rogue killer programmed to assassinate someone,, which isn't that bad, but some of the theories in the movie like the Oliver Stone --George Bush one,, I was like wow OK.. Mel's character, Jerry Fletcher is majorly paranoid, insanely crazy as one of his theories actually turns out to be true, problem for him is as he has so many now he has to figure out which theory he is right about,, he get's help from a young lady he saved from a mugging 6 months ago,, so he is like her guardian angel so to speak,, very interesting movie,, once you get by all the covert military mind control stuff.

Richard Donner made The Omen and Superman, so I have to cut him some slack sometimes. He also made The Goonies, Scrooged, the Lethal Weapon movies and The Toy. So yeah. I give him plenty of slack.It was written by Brian Helgeland, who started his career with 976-EVIL, which led to A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. He also wrote and directed 42 and Legend, about the Kray twins.The two met when Donner saw Helgeland holding a sign that said, "Will write for work, for money". Donner had decided to give Helgeland a chance, which led to the two of them working on this movie and on Assassins.Mel Gibson plays Jerry Fletcher, the nicest conspiracy-theorist and New York City taxi driver ever created by Hollywood, who is in love with Alice Sutton, a Justice Department lawyer played by Julia Roberts. She humors him because he once saved her from a mugging, but then again, he also stalks her.Soon, they are both in conflict with CIA doctor Dr. Jonas (Patrick Stewart), who coincidentally experimented on Fletcher and killed Sutton's father. You know how it works in these big budget conspiracy affairs.Here's something that also shouldn't surprise you: Gibson ad-libbed all of his lines as a cabbie as he scares his passengers with his ranting theories.

This movie could be classified into different genres - suspense, romance & thriller.  Not many films can say that, or if they can, many do not succeed. Conspiracy Theory, however, did.The first time I saw this, I was on the edge of my seat.  It was very suspensful.  I won't go into details if you haven't seen it, but it's really one of the best suspense films I've seen.This wasn't a completely romantic film, no.  In fact, I wish it would've touched on the romance more than it did.  Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts had great chemistry.  Although nothing really happened between them, the audience could clearly see Jerry's (Mel Gibson)love for Alice (Julia Roberts.)Now, the plot.  Jerry Fletcher has many wild conspiracy theories - including one that NASA is trying to kill the President with earthquakes.  He's a cabbie & tells lots of people his ideas.  But the one person he seems to tell the most to and thinks can help him is Alice Sutton, an attorney.  He saved her months before the movie takes place when she was mugged.  He seems to get on her nerves, but she puts up with him.  He goes to her office all the time.  He's obviously in love with her, but she doesn't feel the same way.  Well, somehow "they" (CIA, FBI, you know "they") find out about Jerry's crazy conspiracies & they go after him.  He and Alice are in danger.The acting in this movie was terrific.  This may be Mel's best.  His portrayal of a crazy cabbie was so good and believable.  It's not really like any other role he has played.  He did it so well & the audience sympathized with him completely.  Julia was good too.  Her role wasn't really difficult to play, but she made it believably nevertheless. Patrick Stewart also stars in this.  He made a great bad guy.Overall, this movie was great.  It was very suspensful & the acting was outstanding.

Conspiracy Theory Jerry Fletcher (Mel Gibson) is a lonely New York City taxi driver who lives a very organised, but paranoid, existence. He spends his spare time pouring over newspapers in his high security apartment, looking for suspicious coincidences between the pages, and forming wild conspiracy theories based on them (which he recounts to his unwilling passengers the next day). He is also infatuated with Alice Sutton (Julia Roberts), a woman who works for the government, whose father has recently been killed under mysterious circumstances, and whom Jerry once saved the life of. One day, Jerry is kidnapped and interrogated by a mysterious man (a good Patrick Stewart). Jerry escapes, but soon realises that one of his conspiracy theories may have come true. But he has trouble convincing Alice of this, who has listened to Jerry's musings far too many times to believe any of them.While his creative output over the years hasn't been specifically worth mentioning, Richard Donner is hardly a filmmaker deserving of much criticism; his movies supply solid, if forgettable, entertainment that is worth the price of admission. And yet, at the same time, it's fairly disappointing to watch him try, and fail, to replicate the artistic success of his 1978 hit 'Superman'. 'Conspiracy Theory' tries to coax Donner away from his traditional formula of flying bullets and jokes (seen badly, minus the jokes, in the 1995 dud 'Assassins'), and is ultimately a more highbrow outing for the director than you might expect. But intricate plotting aside, 'Theory' just doesn't know what to do with itself, and it only half accomplishes what it does know how to do.Despite this all, the film does starts off on the right foot, with a first act that determinedly invites the audience into Jerry's specific, unreal world. At this time, one may think perhaps Donner teaming up again with 'Assassins' scribe Brian Helgeland wasn't a bad idea, as 'Theory' offers truly entertaining moments when it lets the audience see how Jerry's eccentric lifestyle brushes against the people of the city, and inhibits his own daily activities. It's not classic Donner, but it's pleasurable in an unchallenging way.Easily identifiable as the moment where 'Theory' stops holding water is when the film tumbles into a cat-and-mouse thriller, which sees our misunderstood protagonist finding it increasingly hard to stay ahead of his pursuers, or keep an easy grip on his sanity. Jerry's journey into his past alone could have been enough to maintain audience interest, but Helgeland can't decide whether his film is more of a romance or a mystery, and he ends up writing in too much of both, including a slightly too happy denouement, and plot twists and turns that, rather than emerging smoothly as the film progresses, seem to be thrown in interstitially and without proper notice. Surprisingly (or not?), Donner is partly to blame as well, as the film sags badly in the mid-section, all too soon falling back on Helgeland's ineffective comic moments, moments that the film really did not need.Thankfully, Richard Donner has star Mel Gibson (in their sixth collaboration) to fall back on. A veteran of Donner's overrated 'Lethal Weapon' franchise, Gibson doesn't fully succeed in keeping the oddities of the character from overwhelming his performance, but he manages to display Jerry's instability with little trouble. Gibson delivers solid work here, as does Julia Roberts, in perhaps her most intelligent role to date. I had a hard time swallowing the actress's lazy "smile"-acting in the annoying 'My Best Friend's Wedding' last June, but 'Theory' reveals once again her under-appreciated dramatic skills. Together, the two leads muster up an adequately engaging screen spark, and help make the film rousing where Donner and Helgeland couldn't have allowed it to. 'Theory' is another near miss for Donner, but it's worth cracking even so, all thanks to Gibson and Roberts.~ 6/10 ~

Conspiracy Theory is a 1997 thriller that centers around Jerry (Mel Gibson), a spaced-out taxi driver, and his relationship with Alice (Julia Roberts), a Justice Dept lawyer. Jerry drives tons of passengers around (pre-Uber) in his cab spouting all sorts of conspiracy theories to them about anything you can imagine. He's whacky - or is he.As the film proceeds, you learn he has been building a relationship with Alice, but you are not quite sure why. Gibson plays his role keenly, not revealing too much, other than that his character likes confined spaces - the cab, and his apartment, which is tiny and well fortified.Events happen that bring in the antagonist, Dr Jonas, played beautifully by Patrick Stewart, who looked amazingly old even 20 years ago - or maybe it was makeup. His character seemed to be lifted right out of the film Marathon Man, with Sir Lawrence Olivier, with one very memorable scene in particular.A cat-and-mouse game leads you on a chase, skullduggery, deception, even life and death. The film reveals pretty early on who the bad guys are - that could have been better handled. Otherwise, this was a pretty decent thriller, with Mel Gibson still young enough to pull this off. Julia Roberts was stunning in her role, which reminds me of how terrific she is as an actor. This role allowed her to be much more than a pretty woman with a cute smile. She had to kick some butt, and she does.The film direction is, by necessity, confusing and often dark. Many of the scenes happen at night or in dark places. It was a bit jarring at times, but that supports the struggles that Jerry is going thru as he tries to figure out his life, and as Alice tries to understand the truth.The ending was pretty predictable, and as Hollywood goes, leaves you with a good feeling. It's a worthwhile film that delivers some terrific acting with a decent plot that is Jason Bourne-like in some ways. Enjoy.

I had seen this movie in my early teen years and remembered it vaguely but fondly over the years. I watched it again now decades later, and it actually holds up better than I remembered. It clearly does not mean to be a serious story, but it has some great moments of wit and entertainment. While relatively spoofed, the action fares well against the more deliberate productions from not only the years this film was released but also modern counterparts. It truly offers more substance than is apparent, and I think any deficiencies around the plot can easily be forgiven considering all of the above.

This is a steady paced well made, twister of a drama, with sharply laced comedy around the perimeter. I was told by a woman that I worked with when this came out before I saw it, she said, "You're like Jerry Fletcher. That guy Mel Gibson plays in that new movie, Conspiracy Theory." The thing that I didn't tell her was that...I had driven a taxi just the year before I met her. Oh, this is just getting too close here now. Okay shall we...I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about, but I went and saw the movie. I don't think totally so, but maybe some small similarities could be possible...I guess. So I was talking to someone when I drove professionally and realized there was no one in the back...so what!The casting was beautiful, all the players were superb! The plot was right on, the twists, that would occur, here and there kept you guessing and hopeful. The action was brisk and well set, propelling and then slowing to a place of horror for a little while, then back 'on' again moving fast! No matter what the opinion of the average movie-watcher-Joe, Gibson always has a different feel. It doesn't seem like he is a movie star, more rather a real solid guy, it seems that he is who he is portraying. There is a certain style that he has that seems like he could be related, or someone that you would like to hang-out with and enjoy a beer. Julia Roberts shines in this. She cares, she is real and it comes through from the time they meet on to the departure and before the next meeting. Hey, there's a thought, Mel and Julia could take another 'pairing' of roles together.This was a truly wild ride with a very different ending. Worth Gibson fan's or Roberts fan's time. This is a must see if you enjoy a solid story with racy action and a wonderful plot that moves along and then slightly twists toward the end. Recommended excellent (*****)

As long as there's been man, there's been conspiracies. For example....-Do aliens really exist? -Did man walk on the moon? -Was JFK really shot in the head? -Is Elvis still alive? -Are Phil Smyth's substitution patterns really a secret code he's sending to the Chinese Government?"Conspiracy Theory", starring Mel Gibson (star of "What Women Want") and Julia Roberts (star of "Mystic Pizza"), join forces to star in this movie about a man who is full of conspiracies...and one day seems to stumble upon one that is real. Before long Jerry(Gibson) is running for his life. Luckily he gets some help from a Justice Dept worker, Alice (Roberts), a long time crush and listener to his crackpot theories. It becomes clear though that there's more to this discovery, and the web of mystery becomes an intricate as a spider's web.Not bad, help my interest and got me through a quiet Fri night. Loses points for the woeful score.

Oddly compelling but ultimately absurd tale of man (Gibson) kidnapped for CIA experiment involving mind control for the purpose of committing covertly sanctioned assassinations. His bizarre experience leads him to justice department attorney (Roberts) whose federal judge father (Bert Remsen in flashback) was slain by a brainwashed assassin. But when CIA mind control project boss (Stewart) discovers the potential for the secret to be revealed, he employs covert tactics to prevent the leak.Gibson is way over the top in his portrayal, a babbling nutcase with obsessive compulsive disorder and an extreme persecution complex. Roberts is suitably stony-faced, but just doesn't look convincing in her characterisation. Patrick Stewart is perhaps the most watchable aspect of this film, as the shady and clinically brutal CIA assassin trainer. Special mention to Cylk Cozart as one of trustworthy agents who manages a couple of mild chuckles when he feigns unconsciousness after misguided attempts to knock him out miss the mark.There's simply too many plot holes and contrivances to suspend disbelief for the mammoth two-hour plus duration. It's one of those movies that compels you to hang on in anticipation of some great revelation or moment, alas, it never eventuates. The climax is rushed and disappointing and the film's sing-a-long conclusion is embarrassing. No great shakes, just an immense waste of time.

If you liked PAYBACK and 12 MONKEYS, you will love this film. I have one thing to say about this film... Mel GIbson.  He plays a paranoid, noble, apparent stalker, who has intelligence and wit,but lacks ability to express himself fully.  Can't say more because it might ruin the movie.  CONSPIRACY THEORY IS A MUST SEE.  It ranks in my top 25 category

Mel Gibson turns a grade four movie into a seven.  He does this with sheer grit, remarkable intensity, and incredible (especially in a cliche-ridden action flick)consistency.  One goes through this movie with him in the same way one went through a Janis Joplin performance--on a very high wire. Certainly memorable--his madness, his beauty, his human-ness (how can we forget all those very personal apologies for his defensive violence).  And certainly his toughness, not this canned romance stuff, should have marked the final scene

Basically a formulaic, uneven, overlong conspiracy thriller, despite the occasional quirkiness and some truly intriguing plot twists. Too many flaws and inconsistencies prevent it from being particularly entertaining; some of Gibson's actions are so far-fetched that we can't take this very seriously as a thriller - and it's never clear if we are supposed to or not. Gibson is very good in a difficult, messily written role, and Patrick Stewart gives a calmly effective performance as the villain; on the other hand, Julia Roberts could hardly be more bland - as a result, very little chemistry between her and Gibson is created.   (**1/2)

Mel Gibson gives a great performance here, as well as Julia Roberts! The story is really good, and the movie has some great plot twists. The only thing I disliked was the fact that Patrick Stewart didn't have a bigger role...The movie also has quite some funny moments and lots of action. This definately is one of Richard Donner's best films to date, due especially to the outstanding performance of Mel Gibson! If you haven't seen it yet and if you're looking for an intelligent, well-acted movie, this is the one!
