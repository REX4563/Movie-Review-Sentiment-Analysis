Following a failed experiment in space, a group of astronauts gain super powers following exposure to radioactive energy. This exposure gives the astronauts different super powers and doctor Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is attempting to find a way to reverse the effects of the radiation on his team. However, Doctor Von Doom (who has also been exposed to the radiation) has his own agenda and is intent on using his super powers to try to take down the Fantastic Four.Given its rather modest 5.7 average user rating I wasn't expecting much here and was actually fearing the worst. However, whilst watching this film I was surprised by how enjoyable I actually found it. The story has quite a lot of depth to it and most of the focus is on how the team cope with the way that the radiation has caused life-changing alterations to their DNA. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) relishes his new found gift and does everything he can to make sure he's in the limelight - this makes sense as he's painted as a rather arrogant individual right from the start. Evans puts in a good performance and despite the arrogance of his character he does still have some likability about him. On the other end of the spectrum, we've got Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkis) whose DNA has been permanently altered by the radiation due to the fact that he received the most exposure to it. There is a very tender scene with his character at the start of the film where he goes back to see his wife and she can't handle what has happened to him and basically has nothing further to do with him (it seems bizarre that she doesn't even ask what has happened to him and doesn't seem interested in standing by him or helping him out - what a b*tch). Chilkis is also excellent here and gives a nicely balance performance with a character that is ugly and gruff on the outside, but has a real heart of gold on the inside. Alba and Gruffudd make up the other two characters in The Fantastic Four (Sue Storm and Reed Richards respectively) and sadly their characters are not quite as interesting as Ben or Johnny and their performances for me weren't quite as strong. Despite this though, the film provides many funny moments (mostly between Ben and Johnny) and the wonderful camaderie and rather interesting story and exploration of their super powers made this a winner in my book.The only weak link with this film lay with Von Doom (Julian McMahon) as the villain of the piece and his motivations; he seems to lose it and go berserk because he's jealous that something is going on between Sue and Reed. OK, that's fine, but why then decide to try and kill Ben and Johnny when his issue is with Richards and Storm. Despite a good turn from McMahon, I never really took to him as a villain as I felt that jealousy alone was a rather thin and flimsy reason to justify his barbaric behaviour.Taking everything into account this is a good film. It's fun, there are some interesting characters here, the exploration of their super powers are interesting and of course the special effects are incredible. It's definitely worth a look.

Fantastic Four (2005) is a charming movie that has a lot of that early 2000's flair to it, and unlike its 2015 counterpart, the characters actually seemed real and you could believe that giant rock man was walking around. As for plot, it could be a little bit more straightfoward, but it doesn't throw me off. It's more of just an annoyance, and I'd say that all of the characters costume design looks a lot better than 2015 Fantastic Four as well. Also, Doctor Doom is more fitting to the comic book representation. Overall, it was a pretty good movie. Don't see why people have such a problem with it.

As a reader of the comics, I was really excited to finally see a movie about my favourite characters. I've learned that a FF film was in "development hell" for some decades, so when it finally came out, obviously I rushed to the theater. And, I was not disappointed at all. Of course it's not as good as X-Men 2 or Spider-Man (the original, with Tobey Maguire), but it's good for what it aims to be: a sci-fi/action movie about comic book characters. You have to understand that the Fantastic Four are not as popular as other heroes, like Iron Man i.e., besides, their stories always covered the most strange, bizarre, far out things imaginable. And, because they are a family, there are many corny moments in the movie, but the comics too have those moments, then you just have to "let it go", to really enjoy the story. Overall, it's a very decent movie about very decent people. Relax, and enjoy the ride!

During a failed experiment in space, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue and Johnny Storm (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Dr. Victor Von Doom are bombarded by cosmic rays, changing their molecular systems and giving them superpowers. Four of them become the superhero team, the Fantastic Four, while Doom becomes their new enemy. The Fantastic Four is far from fantastic but it does make for decent entertainment. The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. This is good news and bad news. The good part is that the film doesn't take itself so seriously and the movie ends up being mildly enjoyable. On the other hand, it becomes silly and cheesy with laughable acting and events. Also, the movie is actually kind of dull. There are some fun spots (like the bridge scene) but there is really no spark to the film. The blame should go to Tim Story and his lack of imagination. He keeps the film bland and dull but he shouldn't get all the blame. He is working with a cheesy and weak script courtesy of Michael France and Mark Frost. If the writing had been a little better and the direction a little sharper then the film could have been better but it stands as a mediocre one. The acting is a mix bag with some good performances and a couple of bad ones. Chris Evans gives the best performance as Johnny Storm. He seems to be having a blast and his performance is contagious. It's also nice to see something different. Usually in super hero movies, the superheroes are moody and they just want a normal life, which isn't a bad thing. However Johnny Storm actually wants to show off and he considers his new powers to be a blessing and not a curse. On the opposite side of Johnny Storm, you have Ben Grimm played by Michael Chiklis. He is the exact opposite and he wants to give rid of his powers. His situation is pretty sad since his fiancé leaves him and it's hard for him to really live a normal life. Chiklis gives a good performance and it was a little heartwarming. Jessica Alba gives a bad performance as Sue Storm. She is unconvincing as a scientist and her emotions feel fake. Ioan Gruffudd is actually somehow worse and he can't really act. His chemistry with Jessica Alba is almost non existent. The only other person worth mentioning is Julian McMahon and he plays Dr. Victor Von Doom. I think he makes a good bad guy and he gives a decent performance. Despite the lack of quality in the film, Fantastic Four is pretty harmless. There is nothing here that should really offend anyone and it works better with kids than with adults or teenagers. The film has some things going for it though. The special effects are at least above average and the movie provides decent eye candy. As previously noted, there are some performances that stood out so the whole experience isn't a complete waste of time. However, The Fantastic Four is still a disappointment. In the end, the movie is worth a rental at the most, in my opinion. Rating 5/10

Title: Fantastic Four Condensed Storyline: Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, Ben Grimm and Victor Von Doom go up into space to measure comic rays when their ship is struck by them. This leads to them all developing their own individual superpowers. But this leads Reed to work to try and transform them back to normal, but he isn't able to and Dr Doom is able to turn Ben back to normal, but then starts taking them out one by one, mainly because they cost him his company. So the Fantastic Four have to stop him and save the day. Notable Acting: Just putting this out there first, Chris Evans plays Captain America better than he plays Johnny Storm. Ioan Gruffudd plays Mr Fantastic, and feels like that nerd who has to do the science project for his group while trying to stop them from fighting all the time. Michael Chiklis plays a great Ben Grimm as you can get the feeling that his is trying to come to terms with the way he looks I loved Julian McMahon as Dr Doom, he has that suave sense of evil to him which makes him perfect for a villain, but still a believable villain at that. Jessica Alba as Sue Storm. I felt like she really captured the helplessness and general uselessness of Sue Storm perfectly, while acting as the mother type character stopping Johnny and Ben from fighting. Noticeable Camera work: What the movie lacks in creative angles, it makes up in creative frame up jobs for the camera, that is always a good sign to see in a cinematographer and movie. We are given a nice birds eye shot once we are introduced to Johnny on his way to the rocket. When Victor shows Sue the Earth from space station we get what looks to be a panning, tilting 130º crane shot, which was beautifully pull off. We get a POV shot so we see things from the view of Ben, but this is a little trick to the audience as they would think that Ben has transformed, but this is a little joke played by Johnny. Establishing shot of the alps when Johnny goes skiing. The shot the follows to him throwing Reed out of a window has him see his reflection which is mutilated so just as he brakes the glass on the floor, the helmet's class case in his office breaks. That is a nice translation shot.Graphics: The CGI for Johnny's fire was impressive and nicely done at the very least. His fire seemed constant and realistic. Sue's CGI was OK, not really all too impressive as most of that can be done easily with green screen and such. Reed's stretch-armstrong type limbs are decent at worst. Victor's lighting is interesting as it borders on being good and bad at the same time with me. Costume: The costumes looked quite nice and worked better than other renditions of the suits I've seen, they remind me of the comics as they are that similar. Quite a lot of people have said they disliked how Ben looked as the Thing, most of those other people said it should have been done with CGI. The Hulk in the 2008 movie was done with CGI and people didn't like that, this movie was done in 2005. So chances are the CGI wouldn't have been that good for making Ben look like a pile of walking rocks, even for the budget they had for the movie. Incorrect Science: Radiation doesn't give you superpowers. When Reed is testing Johnny's fire in a test chamber constructed of titanium, the temperature shown on screen reaches 4000 Kelvin. Titanium melts at 1941 Kelvin, and boils at 3560 Kelvin. This would incinerate the building where they are working. Along with the added fact of no human being able to set them self on fire and stay like that, mainly because the fire would need a fuel source to stay alight. The sun does this by fusion. A human body isn't hot enough for fusion and doesn't have a fuel source. Sue's invisibility is pointless, mainly because she is bending light around her. This would mean that no light is hitting her eyes so this makes her blind. Don't get me started on how Ben's skin turns to rocks or how Reed's limbs can stretch. If Victor used magic to get his powers in the movie I would not question it, but seeing how he didn't, the question is how is he able to harness electricity? And why is his skin slowly turning into metal? Victor's space station must have developed artificial gravity, because they are casually walking around and not floating, we are at least 10 years off physics wise of creating artificial gravity. Overall Feel: As far as adaptions go, this movie isn't as bad a people are saying it is. Yes, Dr Doom isn't a business man. Yes he got his powers from his mother's witch stuff. Yes his face is suppose to be badly burnt and not metal. Yes Johnny is suppose to have blonde hair and Ben is suppose to have hair in general. Remember the 1994 version? You shouldn't because that was only created so the company could keep the rights to the franchise. That is an example of people not caring or not putting any effort into a movie. This movie is much better than that, sure it messes with the source material, but so did the 2002 movie of Spiderman. That had Mary Jane as the love interest and organic web shooters. But we still love that movie. This movie has its faults and quite a few of them at that, but it is still a great and enjoyable superhero movie which is nicely paced and well written.

In that there are Four of them. But Fantastic? More like "Mediocre", or "Barely Adequate", or "Contractually Sufficient".For once, the reviewers were right. This film is a big, rambling, poorly conceived, sloppily scripted, shoddily acted pile of orange rubble. Avoid it, or suffer the consequences.It's hard to know where to begin, there's so much wrong with it. For a start, the acting "talent" is AWOL. TV performers don't inevitably get lost on the big screen, but this cadre evited it. Alba turns in the exact same performance that she always does, going through her entire range, from "pouty and petulant" to "petulant and pouty". Evans is either a strutting superannuated fratboy poseur, or for some reason is deliberately playing one so well that it's hard to tell the difference - either way, his character is thoroughly irritating and utterly unsympathetic. Chiklis is adequate, but is let down by the plain fact that he's a round little man in a big rubber muscle suit. This was a role for Ron Perlman, not Wimpy. Gruffudd is a huge disappointment; he has no screen presence, and his slightly out-of-his-depth portrayal of Hornblower is apparently the man, not the character. It would have been better if he had been invisible, as he manages to fade into the background with ease in every scene. McMahon is the only actor who appears to be enjoying himself, but as he's barely in the film, he can't rescue it.The script was apparently in development for ten years. I can't see why, as it's one scene, repeated ten times. If this is the refined version, I shudder to imagine what the raw cut would have been like. I find it hard to believe that the lines were written by, or for, adults. There's no real plot to the film, or even a story beyond "Nasty self absorbed un-credible astronauts become nasty self absorbed un-credible 'super' heroes, then argue with each other for a while, take their clothes off for no reason, then beat up some poor disfigured guy apparently because he didn't join their little gang, roll credits." Direction and cinematography was Filmschool #101, the score was instantly forgettable, and the editing was appalling, with the pacing in particular being random and rushed.The effects were only what we've come to expect from a hundred million dollar movie, which brings me to the big question: what on earth did they spend all that money on? It wasn't on the "talent", either on-screen or off, it certainly wasn't on the rubber suit, and the effects couldn't have cost that much - or if they did, they were seriously over-charged.I have an idea where at least some of the budget went. From IMDb's Trivia section: "Contains over 25 cameos from real life employees of Fox television affiliates." And I strongly suspect that the IMDb records for this movie contain about 2,5000 comments and ratings and mutual approvals from about five of those real life employees. Reading the top recommended comments, most of which have 10 ratings, reveals a depressing pattern of almost identically styled raves from the likes of "top10dude" and "BigTenPower" with embarrassingly obvious track records of enthusing about, you guessed it, other shoddy Fox movies. When someone rates Elektra a 10, you have to just snort in disbelief at the audacity of it.I guess it's a pretty good investment for Fox, but this kind of astroturfing drastically reduces the usefulness of IMDb as an early review source. With time, this awful, foul mess of a movie will no doubt settle to its rightful place near the bottom of the ratings pile, but it's likely that the shill reviews will stay stubbornly at the top of the recommended pile for a long time to come. Beware; consider the source.[2013 update] To this day, the top 'recommended' comment is an early 10 rating from a member who signed up to IMDb just to rave about this one film using the minimum allowed size of review, and then never contributed again. What dedication!

It's a nice movie I suppose. Seen through a younger viewers eyes this movie appears to be more awesome,and has good special effects for its time. Seen through an adults eyes this movie was just average, Jessica Alba however was not average, seeing her in tights makes this movie very watchable.... I do think movies like this are fine, not all superhero films have to be overly serious,well acted and violent. The audience for movies like Fantastic 4 are out there.The characters personalities stay true to the comic book and thats very important.I've seen this movie 3 times and I'm not a fan of seeing movies more than once usually.Fun silly movies will do this to me.

The Fantastic Four was a pretty good superhero movie but it lacked something. I do not think it truly lived up to it's endless hype from early this year. Aside from a few scenes that stick out, most are in the trailer, there is not much there other than some slick special effects sprinkled about. It is understandable, however, due to the fact that this film is about the origin of 5 different individuals and how they gained their super powers. I imagine the next one (of course, if there is a next one) will be more action packed.As for a quick rundown of the story, 5 people are sent into a space ship to gather information that would be helpful in curing diseases and other good stuff. The crew consists of Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed Richards, (Ioan Gruffudd), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) & Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). While in the space station, the super cosmic storm hits hours earlier than expected and all 5 are caught in the storm, forever altering their DNA (or something like that). The one that got it the worst was Grimm.The standouts from this movie are The Thing/Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm/Human Torch & Sue Storm/Invisible Girl. The Thing & Torch stand out because of both their characters and personalities & Jessica Alba stands out pretty much just because she is Jessica Alba.I feel that Reed Richards was more of an annoyance in the movie and not as likable a character as, say, the Human Torch. Also, I fear that Dr. Doom will probably forever be compared to the Green Goblin from Spider-Man, due to the hokey masks and all. Also, the voice for Doom did not quite fit for me. I am not sure if his voice is supposed to be that docile or not, but I always pictured a deeper, more menacing voice for him.I do hope this movie is not as criticized as movies such as Hulk or Daredevil. This movie was not that bad, probably not even as bad as I have made it seem. I would rate it somewhere in between X-Men and Daredevil. 7.5/10

It could've been fantastic but unfortunately this movie manages only to pass off as average... As far as comic book licensed movies go, Fantastic Four did get a lot of things right. First of all they got most of the characters' personalities and relationships right. The Thing and Human Torch's exchanges were very faithful to the source material and did provide the most fun parts of the movie... The costumes were also spot-on as well as the Thing's make up. The special effects guys deserve special praise because the Thing didn't look fake at all. The Human Torch looked cool too... But unfortunately, the good elements stop here. The movie has huge problems. Its biggest problem is its story. Its far too simple and devoid of any depth. The only thing that provides some substance in the story are the scenes exploring the Thng's situation since he's the one who was hit the worst by the mutation. The problem with the story is that for a Super-Hero based movie, there's pretty much nothing heroic going on. The only times that the F.F. get to act as heroes are when they help people get out of an accident on a bridge, and when they fight Dr. Doom. Other than that they just have fun with their powers or try to find a way to get rid of them... Dr. Doom, the villain, is one of the most under-developed villains of all time and he only appears as his evil masked persona for about 5 minutes towards the end of the movie... The ending too is really disappointing and anti-climactic to say the least. Another problem was the casting. The actors playing the Thing and the Human Torch were both excellent choices for their parts, unfortunately though pretty much everyone else is a bad choice. The guy playing Mr. Fantastic is way too young to play the part of the genius and the team's voice of reason. Mr. Fantastic in the comics is like in his early 50s and this man wasn't even in his early 30s... The same goes for Jessica Alba, although i can't complaint about seeing her for 120 minutes or so in a skin tight outfit but there's no chance in hell she'd pass for a genius in biology. She doesn't even look old enough to have finished college for Pete's Sake. Finally we have Dr. Doom. The problem with the guy playing him is that he doesn't look evil at all... He has to be the most unconvincing villain i have ever seen.Now i can't say that i wasted two hours of my life watching Fantastic Four. It was quite faun, it was filled with funny scenes and it definitely did have its very good moments and one can't say that it was boring. But after all those excellent comic book movies out there like X-2, Spider-Man and Batman: Begins the bar has been raised high and Fantastic Four certainly didn't have what it takes to go over it. Just your average Super-Hero movie then and to paraphrase Blur's On Your Own: It's not that good but it's not that bad... 5/10

Another unjustly bashed movie. Of course it is not masterpiece of cinematography, but it doesn't try to be. Solid adaptation of comic-book in manner typical for Marvel - expensive, huge, light and very entertaining. Plus, it has Jessica Alba in tight costume. She even gets completely naked several times, but unfortunately she plays role of Invisible Girl, so not much use of it.7,5/10

First let me say that I love the Fantastic Four comic books. I know exactly what works and what doesn't. So I feel well qualified to evaluate this film.Secondly we need to address the issue of: Should a movie be 100% faithful to source material? Well, even if it were possible would you want the movie to be a carbon copy of the source material? Some things don't translate well to the screen. And sometimes (Harry Potter 1 *cough*) trying to be just like the original material is a bad idea! But when a character is fundamentally changed that's usually a bad idea. Fantastic Four takes many liberties with the characters some are worse than others. But a director and writer need to find the right medium that is a balance between the source and making a good movie. In this movie they changed the story around to try to make a better movie and failed! Perhaps they should have hired Goyer (Blade films, Batman Begins) to write the script, somebody who appreciates the original material.Fantastic Four is a film about a group of four people who are changed in a cosmic "accident" and form a Super-Hero team. The film tries to make it a movie about coping with change and family strife, which is in theory a good idea but fails here. We are presented with a film that tries many things and all of them feel half-done. The only things that saved the film and made me give it a 7/10 are the Ben Grimm parts of the story. We have somebody who is transformed into a monster and hates it. Also the movie tries to rush into the transformation, which is a good idea, but slows down right afterwards and just meanders forward.Overall: Not horrible. But if the people at FOX are reading this: You had a chance to make a great movie and blew it with a mediocre script, crappy director and over mediocrity!

FANTASTIC FOUR Now honestly, I knew I couldn't expect much when I rented this movie, but all I wanted was stupid entertainment. But this movie was so terrible and simple that it was confusing.This has to be one of the most god-awful screenplays that Hollywood has ever produced. Being completely honest... I could have written a better screenplay and directed a better film.The Fantastic Four as a comic-book has enormous cinematic potential because it takes a group of super-heroes who are reluctantly thrust into their roles as super-humans... however, their stories are even stronger b/c of the honest and deep family dynamic they hold as a team.Every piece of that is lost in this translation to film. In order to set up a good franchise, they should have taken the time to explore who these people are before and during their mission to space. Reed's mission isn't described to the audience as anything deeper than "if we head into space and get a testing from a space cloud, we can help people live longer". That's honestly the most detailed description of his mission.And the dynamic between Reed and Sue Storm is never actually apparent between the actors... there are only random moments of dialogue that spoon feed the audience the most elementary tension between them.Basicall the film is a giant waste of a source material that could have made a great film. It's filled with implausibilities and unexplained errors... for example: - Why could Reed's every-day, cotton shirts stretch to unbelievable lengths along with his body? However, in order for Jessica Alba to become invisible she must strip off her clothes... yeah, very subtle... hot chick gets naked...What was the point of The Thing (Michael Chiklis) saving the one suicidal man on the bridge? B/C in the process of doing so he destroys about 10 cars and probably kills numerous people on the highway.How did The Thing manage to change himself back into his deformed self without anyone to push the button? - What was with all the BLATANT, BLATANT, BLATANT product placements? Pathetic.If they were in quarantine, how did Chris Evans managed to take that awful actress from ACCESS Hollywood not only out of the building... but in a ****ing helicopter on a huge mountain? Aside from all of this, the performances are awful. The only actor who comes out slightly unscathed is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/"Human Torch"... he obviously got to ad-lib some lines which gave him the best dialogue in the film. Jessica Alba is not only completely wrong for the role of Sue Storm (with a good screenplay this is the kind of role that should be played by Naomi Watts or Charlize Theron... she's supposed to be maternal and wise). Whoever played Mr. Fantastic should never work again. Micheal Chikless as The Thing offers one of the worst performances ever given while wearing such a ridiculous costume (The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were played better). And Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom wasn't scary for a single frame.I can't tell if it's all to blame on Tim Story, the director *cough cough. I can tell you this is about one of the least talented young directors working today... TAXI and FANTASTIC FOUR, greeeeat resume buddy.Honestly, I knew I couldn't expect much... but the universal awfulness of this movie was just ridiculous. Not once was it exciting, funny, or tense. It just wasted two hours of life. And it's extra disappointing b/c I can picture in my head how great of a film could have been made from the source material.Awww well... Hollywood blew a good opportunity and everyone involved made a fool of themselves doing so. Too bad.... F ...

And no I'm not talking about Jessica Alba here (I wonder why someone would think that? ;o) ... but seriously though, the two reasons why this movie worked for me and wasn't as bad as the critics made it sound are: Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans! Their "relationship" is the core or anchor of the movie. Before I go on, I also have to admit, that I don't know the FF comics that well, so any inaccuracy that might be in the movie, I can't point them out to you. One thing is for sure, if someone goes invisible, without clothes, that means you can't see them! (wouldn't have been PG-13 then also, right?) ;o) So while the movie has it's flaws (storyline/some action/characters/and so forth), it is still a nice/good enough movie to watch and it all comes down to two people! (there's also an unrated longer version out now on DVD, but I haven't seen that yet)

Not a fantastic 4 fan so never read the books. But me and my GF caught a closed screening of it and I thought it was a solid movie. Better than I expected. Its a lot like the spiderman movies because of humor but serious at the same time. A lot of laughs and some sad parts also.The movie begin with Reed, Sue, Johnny Storm, Ben and Doom going up into space to look for medical cures in a space cloud called the cosmic storm. The storm hits them and it gives them these strange powers. We seem them getting used to the new powers and using them to help regular people. They become celebrities in the public eye but there are many problems inside the team. Never seen superheroes fight like this but the Fantastic 4 bicker a lot. Ben and Johnny act like 5 yr olds and get into it bad at the x-games. Sue and Reed really love each other but reed is too distracted to pay her attention. And doctor doom turns them against each other and breaks the group up.A lot of romance in this movie more than the hulk or x-men. Ben looks like a monster and the public doesn't identify to him as much as the other 4. But a beautiful blind woman named alicia does and she helps him cope because she knows what its like to be outcast too. The actors who played these two characters were very good because of the touching scenes showing how terrible he felt because he was now a hideous monster while the rest of the 4 still look human. I felt sorry for his rejection and pain like wolverine said when his claws come out every time. The big love story is about Reed and Sue. They cant get on the same page for most of the movie and Doom thinks he owns Sue. But she rejects him for Reed and I wont spoil it all but the end is a very beautiful scene that was almost better than when MJ came back for Peter at the end of Spider-man 2. The actors all do a convincing job. My favourite was the wicked Julian Macmahon. Doom is one scary strange one who reminded me of the emperor in Sith but better looking. Some of his lines were weak but it did not come off cheesy because of the way he said them and acted. He's the villain but you admire him since he is suave and intimidating. Was also impressed with Alba. She has come a long way since dark angel. I liked her in Sin City but this movie showed she is more than a sex symbol. Some don't think shes a good actress but she did a very great job here. She and Iaon Gruffud are really good together.I thought it was good. Story could have been a bit more complex but the actors, direction and effects make up for it, and the Human Torch is impressive to see on the big screen. 9/10.

Because of the overwhelming barrage of unfavorable reviews, I went into "Fantastic Four" with very low expectations. I was still utterly disappointed with what I saw. It is probably the worst movie based on a comic book that I've ever seen (having not yet had the pleasure of sitting through "Elektra" or "Catwoman"). Prior to "Fantastic Four" I would've awarded this "honor" to "Daredevil," but alas (Yes, I'm sorry to say) "Fantastic Four" is even worse.First off, it moves far too quickly. I don't mean that the movie is just a collection of action sequences strung together (although there is little or no plot to connect one scene to the next). In fact, there is very little action in the movie. What I mean is that the pace of the film is too rushed. The line readings, for example, are delivered much too fast. The director should've varied the pace a bit more, particularly in the so-called "dramatic" scenes.I don't think the movie was very well cast either. The performances are embarrassingly bad. They go from flat and dull one second to over-the-top and obnoxious the next (the worst offender being the amazingly stiff and lifeless Jessica Alba). The only actor who seems to bring any degree (no matter how small) of subtlety or depth to his character is Michael Chiklis. Perhaps the actors simply did the best they could with what they had to work with, because the characters are uninteresting, unsympathetic and, at times, flat-out annoying (especially Chris Evans' hotshot thrill-seeking "Human Torch").The only thing worse than the pace, the characterizations and the performances was the writing. The dialogue is incredibly shallow and obvious. Practically every line is a cliché. Here's a small sample:"You're such a dork, Reed." "Which of you is the leader?" "Johnny, say you're sorry." "You two need a time-out." "He started it." "You need to control yourself. Think before you act." "Nothing personal." "Being different isn't always bad." "We're all in this together." "I can't hold it!" "Ya done good, kid."The special effects aren't really that special. At times they work just fine. At other times they look very cartoonish and unbelievable. The score, by the usually reliable John Ottman, is uninspired and, quite frankly, very corny. The choice of songs for the movie were also pretty bad. The direction is sadly lacking in any artistic vision or style. Having previously done comedies like "Taxi" and "Barbershop," Tim Story just doesn't seem to demonstrate the natural grasp for the material that Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer does.Speaking in very broad, generalizing terms, those are just some of the problems I had with the movie. To get more specific, however, I would have to give away a few spoilers. If you haven't yet seen the film, and still plan to, you may want to skip over this next section. *SPOILERS*Despite the fact that throughout the film they continue to search for an explanation, it is never revealed how or why the space storm arrives early.After his transformation, Ben calls his girlfriend from a payphone outside his home. He asks her to come outside, which she does... in her negligee (despite the fact that it's nighttime).When Ben inadvertently causes a pile-up on a bridge, his three friends just happen to arrive on that same bridge at the very moment the accidents begin to occur. On the bridge, Reed Richards tells Sue Storm he and Chris can't get past the police to help Ben, but (because of her invisibility) she can. She immediately turns invisible, removes her undergarments and gets by the police, but then so do Reed and her brother. What was the point then of her turning invisible and stripping (besides the obvious reason of providing the audience with a brief glimpse at Jessica Alba's body)? Ben's girlfriend also goes to the trouble of coming to the bridge and pushing her way through the crowd simply to return a ring to Ben. She takes it off, places it on the street and walks away without saying a word. In the scene that immediately follows, Chris sardonically asks Ben, "Where are your ears?" Considering the man just lost his love, he couldn't show just a bit more understanding?The films establishes that Ben weighs close to 700 pounds (he can stall an elevator and leave footprints in the pavement). Yet, in the climatic fight scene, he slides off the hood of a car without even leaving a scratch, let alone a dent.*END OF SPOILERS*Overall, I'd say the movie was very sloppily and carelessly put together. Things are set up but never paid off. Significant questions are posed but never answered. The movie had potential but never even came close to realizing it. My advice to improve "Fantastic Four" would've been a complete overhaul of the script (probably by some different writers), a different director and, aside from Michael Chiklis, a different cast.

This movie is very enjoyable like it don't need a dark tone and Dr.Doom looks better. I'd wish I watch the 90s one even though it didn't age well but still I want to. At least the characters are likable then Fant4stic because the characters in the movie are lifeless while in this film there not boring. I know the film is not the best but I have a good time with it

I was very upset at hearing that Director Tim Story was helming this project. Knowing his past works (Taxi & barbershop) and the past failed attempts with this title, I was not confident in his ability to tell this story.I WAS WRONG.The story and Character development of this project were tight and the special effects were awesome as well. There are some aspects of the film that I still cal into question (Jessica Alba has neither the age or the depth for the sue storm Character) but I understand certain concessions of making a large budget studio project. (Besides ALBA IS HOT, especially in the skin tight blue suit) All in all, I say "Good work Mr. Story" I'm sorry for doubting you>

This movie is just so BORING! The actors are cheesecake and the whole thing is so predictable. The special effects aren't so special, nothing of interest happens for the first hour and a half. It reminded me of the old joke:"Man goes into the butchers and asks for a pound of bacon, the butcher asks 'Lean back?' so the man leans back and asks for a pound of bacon."Not funny, not clever and wholly predictable Batman. The experience of watching this movie reminded me of watching the Hulk and I only ever wanted to do that once in my lifetime.If you have nothing better to do than watch this movie then do nothing.When is Hollywood going to stop force feeding us these toothpaste advertising "actors"? Someone save us from the shiny happy people.

Following a failed experiment in space, a group of astronauts gain super powers following exposure to radioactive energy. This exposure gives the astronauts different super powers and doctor Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is attempting to find a way to reverse the effects of the radiation on his team. However, Doctor Von Doom (who has also been exposed to the radiation) has his own agenda and is intent on using his super powers to try to take down the Fantastic Four.Given its rather modest 5.7 average user rating I wasn't expecting much here and was actually fearing the worst. However, whilst watching this film I was surprised by how enjoyable I actually found it. The story has quite a lot of depth to it and most of the focus is on how the team cope with the way that the radiation has caused life-changing alterations to their DNA. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) relishes his new found gift and does everything he can to make sure he's in the limelight - this makes sense as he's painted as a rather arrogant individual right from the start. Evans puts in a good performance and despite the arrogance of his character he does still have some likability about him. On the other end of the spectrum, we've got Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkis) whose DNA has been permanently altered by the radiation due to the fact that he received the most exposure to it. There is a very tender scene with his character at the start of the film where he goes back to see his wife and she can't handle what has happened to him and basically has nothing further to do with him (it seems bizarre that she doesn't even ask what has happened to him and doesn't seem interested in standing by him or helping him out - what a b*tch). Chilkis is also excellent here and gives a nicely balance performance with a character that is ugly and gruff on the outside, but has a real heart of gold on the inside. Alba and Gruffudd make up the other two characters in The Fantastic Four (Sue Storm and Reed Richards respectively) and sadly their characters are not quite as interesting as Ben or Johnny and their performances for me weren't quite as strong. Despite this though, the film provides many funny moments (mostly between Ben and Johnny) and the wonderful camaderie and rather interesting story and exploration of their super powers made this a winner in my book.The only weak link with this film lay with Von Doom (Julian McMahon) as the villain of the piece and his motivations; he seems to lose it and go berserk because he's jealous that something is going on between Sue and Reed. OK, that's fine, but why then decide to try and kill Ben and Johnny when his issue is with Richards and Storm. Despite a good turn from McMahon, I never really took to him as a villain as I felt that jealousy alone was a rather thin and flimsy reason to justify his barbaric behaviour.Taking everything into account this is a good film. It's fun, there are some interesting characters here, the exploration of their super powers are interesting and of course the special effects are incredible. It's definitely worth a look.

Fantastic Four (2005) is a charming movie that has a lot of that early 2000's flair to it, and unlike its 2015 counterpart, the characters actually seemed real and you could believe that giant rock man was walking around. As for plot, it could be a little bit more straightfoward, but it doesn't throw me off. It's more of just an annoyance, and I'd say that all of the characters costume design looks a lot better than 2015 Fantastic Four as well. Also, Doctor Doom is more fitting to the comic book representation. Overall, it was a pretty good movie. Don't see why people have such a problem with it.

As a reader of the comics, I was really excited to finally see a movie about my favourite characters. I've learned that a FF film was in "development hell" for some decades, so when it finally came out, obviously I rushed to the theater. And, I was not disappointed at all. Of course it's not as good as X-Men 2 or Spider-Man (the original, with Tobey Maguire), but it's good for what it aims to be: a sci-fi/action movie about comic book characters. You have to understand that the Fantastic Four are not as popular as other heroes, like Iron Man i.e., besides, their stories always covered the most strange, bizarre, far out things imaginable. And, because they are a family, there are many corny moments in the movie, but the comics too have those moments, then you just have to "let it go", to really enjoy the story. Overall, it's a very decent movie about very decent people. Relax, and enjoy the ride!

Fantastic Four is one of the last superhero films, that I can recall, that wasn't insufferably bleak or incredibly serious to a point where any shred of humor was seen as obtuse to the film's narrative. Yes, Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is an indisputable breakthrough in superhero films, but it also made the seriousness of superhero films standard, something that would follow into the late 2000's and early 2010's as Marvel built up The Avengers. Fantastic Four reminds of the quirkiness superhero films were once predicated upon, and while it may get a bit too corny at times, and its focus can never really settle, it's also a very commercial film that satisfies on some level of entertainment when it gives every card in its deck a fair time to shine.We open by looking at a physicist named Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), who is convinced evolution was triggered millions of years ago by stray elements of cosmic energy in space, some of which will pass near Earth very soon. His pal, astronaut Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), works by his side on this potentially revolutionary discovery by helping him convince their old classmate Dr. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), the CEO of Von Doom Industries, to allow both of them access to his private space station to further experiment with the effects of these cosmic energy particles. While Doom agrees, he winds up walking away with most of the profits that this experiment will bring, affirming Reed's desperation to make his project work.Still, he persists on and brings his close friends Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) and her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) along for the ride. However, when a trip to outer space goes awry, exposure with the cosmic energy results in the four receiving deformities and enhanced human abilities that have never before been seen: Reed possesses the ability to stretch every limb of his body, Susan has the ability to disappear and reappear at her leisure, Johnny can have his body engulfed in flame simply by reciting the phrase "Flame on!," and Ben turns into a hideous, orange rock monster.Following the four's mutations, writers Michael France and Mark Frost focus a great deal of their time on the agony that these mutations bring, particularly The Thing, who experiences his wife leaving him shortly after revealing his deformity. While this agony is a solid angle (one I'd argue necessary in most superhero films), too much of the time is spent profiling The Thing and not enough on the remaining characters of the film. Reed and Ben, who are ultimately the film's main focus, wind up monopolizing too much of the picture, and any time we see Johnny is when he's right in the middle of making a smug comment or being his typical, womanizing self.The action in Fantastic Four has a colorful commercial look to it, brilliantly bold and very vibrant in a way that makes many of the scenes pop with life. It manages to achieve a comic book aesthetic without resorting to picture-in-picture editing. One particularly involving scene takes place on a suspension bridge, where The Thing is seen pummeling everything in his sight and the remaining three members of the team must resort to either relaxing him or protecting drivers and innocent bystanders.The goofiness in Fantastic Four, however, in an age of dark superhero films that come with slick aesthetics and brooding characters, is a delightful change of pace. Yes, there is a point when one wishes director Tim Story, France, and Frost would command a tighter grip on the seriousness of the writing, but the pulpy fun of Fantastic Four, in addition to the effects and the neatly choreographed action, keep it a moving, satisfying spectacle that is more than just colors flying around on screen, trying to find their place.Starring: Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Julian McMahon. Directed by: Tim Story.

Watched again and it is awesome that the technique 17 years ago was not that bad. A marvel movie before marvel , and with Alba and young captain! The last fight with big boss was okay , and cannot ask for more.

During a failed experiment in space, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue and Johnny Storm (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Dr. Victor Von Doom are bombarded by cosmic rays, changing their molecular systems and giving them superpowers. Four of them become the superhero team, the Fantastic Four, while Doom becomes their new enemy. The Fantastic Four is far from fantastic but it does make for decent entertainment. The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. This is good news and bad news. The good part is that the film doesn't take itself so seriously and the movie ends up being mildly enjoyable. On the other hand, it becomes silly and cheesy with laughable acting and events. Also, the movie is actually kind of dull. There are some fun spots (like the bridge scene) but there is really no spark to the film. The blame should go to Tim Story and his lack of imagination. He keeps the film bland and dull but he shouldn't get all the blame. He is working with a cheesy and weak script courtesy of Michael France and Mark Frost. If the writing had been a little better and the direction a little sharper then the film could have been better but it stands as a mediocre one. The acting is a mix bag with some good performances and a couple of bad ones. Chris Evans gives the best performance as Johnny Storm. He seems to be having a blast and his performance is contagious. It's also nice to see something different. Usually in super hero movies, the superheroes are moody and they just want a normal life, which isn't a bad thing. However Johnny Storm actually wants to show off and he considers his new powers to be a blessing and not a curse. On the opposite side of Johnny Storm, you have Ben Grimm played by Michael Chiklis. He is the exact opposite and he wants to give rid of his powers. His situation is pretty sad since his fiancé leaves him and it's hard for him to really live a normal life. Chiklis gives a good performance and it was a little heartwarming. Jessica Alba gives a bad performance as Sue Storm. She is unconvincing as a scientist and her emotions feel fake. Ioan Gruffudd is actually somehow worse and he can't really act. His chemistry with Jessica Alba is almost non existent. The only other person worth mentioning is Julian McMahon and he plays Dr. Victor Von Doom. I think he makes a good bad guy and he gives a decent performance. Despite the lack of quality in the film, Fantastic Four is pretty harmless. There is nothing here that should really offend anyone and it works better with kids than with adults or teenagers. The film has some things going for it though. The special effects are at least above average and the movie provides decent eye candy. As previously noted, there are some performances that stood out so the whole experience isn't a complete waste of time. However, The Fantastic Four is still a disappointment. In the end, the movie is worth a rental at the most, in my opinion. Rating 5/10

Title: Fantastic Four Condensed Storyline: Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, Ben Grimm and Victor Von Doom go up into space to measure comic rays when their ship is struck by them. This leads to them all developing their own individual superpowers. But this leads Reed to work to try and transform them back to normal, but he isn't able to and Dr Doom is able to turn Ben back to normal, but then starts taking them out one by one, mainly because they cost him his company. So the Fantastic Four have to stop him and save the day. Notable Acting: Just putting this out there first, Chris Evans plays Captain America better than he plays Johnny Storm. Ioan Gruffudd plays Mr Fantastic, and feels like that nerd who has to do the science project for his group while trying to stop them from fighting all the time. Michael Chiklis plays a great Ben Grimm as you can get the feeling that his is trying to come to terms with the way he looks I loved Julian McMahon as Dr Doom, he has that suave sense of evil to him which makes him perfect for a villain, but still a believable villain at that. Jessica Alba as Sue Storm. I felt like she really captured the helplessness and general uselessness of Sue Storm perfectly, while acting as the mother type character stopping Johnny and Ben from fighting. Noticeable Camera work: What the movie lacks in creative angles, it makes up in creative frame up jobs for the camera, that is always a good sign to see in a cinematographer and movie. We are given a nice birds eye shot once we are introduced to Johnny on his way to the rocket. When Victor shows Sue the Earth from space station we get what looks to be a panning, tilting 130º crane shot, which was beautifully pull off. We get a POV shot so we see things from the view of Ben, but this is a little trick to the audience as they would think that Ben has transformed, but this is a little joke played by Johnny. Establishing shot of the alps when Johnny goes skiing. The shot the follows to him throwing Reed out of a window has him see his reflection which is mutilated so just as he brakes the glass on the floor, the helmet's class case in his office breaks. That is a nice translation shot.Graphics: The CGI for Johnny's fire was impressive and nicely done at the very least. His fire seemed constant and realistic. Sue's CGI was OK, not really all too impressive as most of that can be done easily with green screen and such. Reed's stretch-armstrong type limbs are decent at worst. Victor's lighting is interesting as it borders on being good and bad at the same time with me. Costume: The costumes looked quite nice and worked better than other renditions of the suits I've seen, they remind me of the comics as they are that similar. Quite a lot of people have said they disliked how Ben looked as the Thing, most of those other people said it should have been done with CGI. The Hulk in the 2008 movie was done with CGI and people didn't like that, this movie was done in 2005. So chances are the CGI wouldn't have been that good for making Ben look like a pile of walking rocks, even for the budget they had for the movie. Incorrect Science: Radiation doesn't give you superpowers. When Reed is testing Johnny's fire in a test chamber constructed of titanium, the temperature shown on screen reaches 4000 Kelvin. Titanium melts at 1941 Kelvin, and boils at 3560 Kelvin. This would incinerate the building where they are working. Along with the added fact of no human being able to set them self on fire and stay like that, mainly because the fire would need a fuel source to stay alight. The sun does this by fusion. A human body isn't hot enough for fusion and doesn't have a fuel source. Sue's invisibility is pointless, mainly because she is bending light around her. This would mean that no light is hitting her eyes so this makes her blind. Don't get me started on how Ben's skin turns to rocks or how Reed's limbs can stretch. If Victor used magic to get his powers in the movie I would not question it, but seeing how he didn't, the question is how is he able to harness electricity? And why is his skin slowly turning into metal? Victor's space station must have developed artificial gravity, because they are casually walking around and not floating, we are at least 10 years off physics wise of creating artificial gravity. Overall Feel: As far as adaptions go, this movie isn't as bad a people are saying it is. Yes, Dr Doom isn't a business man. Yes he got his powers from his mother's witch stuff. Yes his face is suppose to be badly burnt and not metal. Yes Johnny is suppose to have blonde hair and Ben is suppose to have hair in general. Remember the 1994 version? You shouldn't because that was only created so the company could keep the rights to the franchise. That is an example of people not caring or not putting any effort into a movie. This movie is much better than that, sure it messes with the source material, but so did the 2002 movie of Spiderman. That had Mary Jane as the love interest and organic web shooters. But we still love that movie. This movie has its faults and quite a few of them at that, but it is still a great and enjoyable superhero movie which is nicely paced and well written.

In that there are Four of them. But Fantastic? More like "Mediocre", or "Barely Adequate", or "Contractually Sufficient".For once, the reviewers were right. This film is a big, rambling, poorly conceived, sloppily scripted, shoddily acted pile of orange rubble. Avoid it, or suffer the consequences.It's hard to know where to begin, there's so much wrong with it. For a start, the acting "talent" is AWOL. TV performers don't inevitably get lost on the big screen, but this cadre evited it. Alba turns in the exact same performance that she always does, going through her entire range, from "pouty and petulant" to "petulant and pouty". Evans is either a strutting superannuated fratboy poseur, or for some reason is deliberately playing one so well that it's hard to tell the difference - either way, his character is thoroughly irritating and utterly unsympathetic. Chiklis is adequate, but is let down by the plain fact that he's a round little man in a big rubber muscle suit. This was a role for Ron Perlman, not Wimpy. Gruffudd is a huge disappointment; he has no screen presence, and his slightly out-of-his-depth portrayal of Hornblower is apparently the man, not the character. It would have been better if he had been invisible, as he manages to fade into the background with ease in every scene. McMahon is the only actor who appears to be enjoying himself, but as he's barely in the film, he can't rescue it.The script was apparently in development for ten years. I can't see why, as it's one scene, repeated ten times. If this is the refined version, I shudder to imagine what the raw cut would have been like. I find it hard to believe that the lines were written by, or for, adults. There's no real plot to the film, or even a story beyond "Nasty self absorbed un-credible astronauts become nasty self absorbed un-credible 'super' heroes, then argue with each other for a while, take their clothes off for no reason, then beat up some poor disfigured guy apparently because he didn't join their little gang, roll credits." Direction and cinematography was Filmschool #101, the score was instantly forgettable, and the editing was appalling, with the pacing in particular being random and rushed.The effects were only what we've come to expect from a hundred million dollar movie, which brings me to the big question: what on earth did they spend all that money on? It wasn't on the "talent", either on-screen or off, it certainly wasn't on the rubber suit, and the effects couldn't have cost that much - or if they did, they were seriously over-charged.I have an idea where at least some of the budget went. From IMDb's Trivia section: "Contains over 25 cameos from real life employees of Fox television affiliates." And I strongly suspect that the IMDb records for this movie contain about 2,5000 comments and ratings and mutual approvals from about five of those real life employees. Reading the top recommended comments, most of which have 10 ratings, reveals a depressing pattern of almost identically styled raves from the likes of "top10dude" and "BigTenPower" with embarrassingly obvious track records of enthusing about, you guessed it, other shoddy Fox movies. When someone rates Elektra a 10, you have to just snort in disbelief at the audacity of it.I guess it's a pretty good investment for Fox, but this kind of astroturfing drastically reduces the usefulness of IMDb as an early review source. With time, this awful, foul mess of a movie will no doubt settle to its rightful place near the bottom of the ratings pile, but it's likely that the shill reviews will stay stubbornly at the top of the recommended pile for a long time to come. Beware; consider the source.[2013 update] To this day, the top 'recommended' comment is an early 10 rating from a member who signed up to IMDb just to rave about this one film using the minimum allowed size of review, and then never contributed again. What dedication!

It's a nice movie I suppose. Seen through a younger viewers eyes this movie appears to be more awesome,and has good special effects for its time. Seen through an adults eyes this movie was just average, Jessica Alba however was not average, seeing her in tights makes this movie very watchable.... I do think movies like this are fine, not all superhero films have to be overly serious,well acted and violent. The audience for movies like Fantastic 4 are out there.The characters personalities stay true to the comic book and thats very important.I've seen this movie 3 times and I'm not a fan of seeing movies more than once usually.Fun silly movies will do this to me.

The Fantastic Four was a pretty good superhero movie but it lacked something. I do not think it truly lived up to it's endless hype from early this year. Aside from a few scenes that stick out, most are in the trailer, there is not much there other than some slick special effects sprinkled about. It is understandable, however, due to the fact that this film is about the origin of 5 different individuals and how they gained their super powers. I imagine the next one (of course, if there is a next one) will be more action packed.As for a quick rundown of the story, 5 people are sent into a space ship to gather information that would be helpful in curing diseases and other good stuff. The crew consists of Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed Richards, (Ioan Gruffudd), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) & Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). While in the space station, the super cosmic storm hits hours earlier than expected and all 5 are caught in the storm, forever altering their DNA (or something like that). The one that got it the worst was Grimm.The standouts from this movie are The Thing/Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm/Human Torch & Sue Storm/Invisible Girl. The Thing & Torch stand out because of both their characters and personalities & Jessica Alba stands out pretty much just because she is Jessica Alba.I feel that Reed Richards was more of an annoyance in the movie and not as likable a character as, say, the Human Torch. Also, I fear that Dr. Doom will probably forever be compared to the Green Goblin from Spider-Man, due to the hokey masks and all. Also, the voice for Doom did not quite fit for me. I am not sure if his voice is supposed to be that docile or not, but I always pictured a deeper, more menacing voice for him.I do hope this movie is not as criticized as movies such as Hulk or Daredevil. This movie was not that bad, probably not even as bad as I have made it seem. I would rate it somewhere in between X-Men and Daredevil. 7.5/10

It could've been fantastic but unfortunately this movie manages only to pass off as average... As far as comic book licensed movies go, Fantastic Four did get a lot of things right. First of all they got most of the characters' personalities and relationships right. The Thing and Human Torch's exchanges were very faithful to the source material and did provide the most fun parts of the movie... The costumes were also spot-on as well as the Thing's make up. The special effects guys deserve special praise because the Thing didn't look fake at all. The Human Torch looked cool too... But unfortunately, the good elements stop here. The movie has huge problems. Its biggest problem is its story. Its far too simple and devoid of any depth. The only thing that provides some substance in the story are the scenes exploring the Thng's situation since he's the one who was hit the worst by the mutation. The problem with the story is that for a Super-Hero based movie, there's pretty much nothing heroic going on. The only times that the F.F. get to act as heroes are when they help people get out of an accident on a bridge, and when they fight Dr. Doom. Other than that they just have fun with their powers or try to find a way to get rid of them... Dr. Doom, the villain, is one of the most under-developed villains of all time and he only appears as his evil masked persona for about 5 minutes towards the end of the movie... The ending too is really disappointing and anti-climactic to say the least. Another problem was the casting. The actors playing the Thing and the Human Torch were both excellent choices for their parts, unfortunately though pretty much everyone else is a bad choice. The guy playing Mr. Fantastic is way too young to play the part of the genius and the team's voice of reason. Mr. Fantastic in the comics is like in his early 50s and this man wasn't even in his early 30s... The same goes for Jessica Alba, although i can't complaint about seeing her for 120 minutes or so in a skin tight outfit but there's no chance in hell she'd pass for a genius in biology. She doesn't even look old enough to have finished college for Pete's Sake. Finally we have Dr. Doom. The problem with the guy playing him is that he doesn't look evil at all... He has to be the most unconvincing villain i have ever seen.Now i can't say that i wasted two hours of my life watching Fantastic Four. It was quite faun, it was filled with funny scenes and it definitely did have its very good moments and one can't say that it was boring. But after all those excellent comic book movies out there like X-2, Spider-Man and Batman: Begins the bar has been raised high and Fantastic Four certainly didn't have what it takes to go over it. Just your average Super-Hero movie then and to paraphrase Blur's On Your Own: It's not that good but it's not that bad... 5/10

I recently watched the 2005 version of "The Fantastic Four" in preparation for the reboot that is in theaters now. This movie and its sequel, "Rise of the Silver Surfer" are 20th Century Fox productions. The Fantastic Four and X-Men franchises were both leased out to Fox prior to Marvel getting its own film production studios, and like other Marvel properties from before the MCU, this film is often bashed by comic book fans.I personally don't see what's not to like here. Indeed, I think that this film does a great job portraying the FF's origin story. Sure, The Thing looks a bit hokey in what is clearly a rubberized suit of some sort, and I think they surely could have found an actor that looked more like Reed Richards from the comics than Ioan Gruffudd (that's quite the name, by the way!). But all in all, this is a.....fantastic....film. lolI give it 8/10 stars. Jessica Alba does great as Sue Storm, and Julian McMahon is a superb Dr. Doom. The plot and the acting are well done, and the pace of the storytelling is good as well. To me, there's much more to like in this movie than to dislike. Language note, though: There is one "GD" in this movie, which I wasn't expecting (it's when Ben Grimm is in the hospital bed after returning from space). I guess it just goes to show that Marvel movies were not always kid-friendly even before the recent trend in the MCU line. So heads up for that.

Another unjustly bashed movie. Of course it is not masterpiece of cinematography, but it doesn't try to be. Solid adaptation of comic-book in manner typical for Marvel - expensive, huge, light and very entertaining. Plus, it has Jessica Alba in tight costume. She even gets completely naked several times, but unfortunately she plays role of Invisible Girl, so not much use of it.7,5/10

This movie was all over the place, the story was stupid, the character development was crap, the action scenes doesn't make sense, the editing of the movie is horrible.The movie failed to make you feel sympathy with the characters, you can't identify with any of them, it felt as if you started watching from the middle of the movie.The action scene on the bridge was amazingly stupid and pointless, the thing causes terrible car wreck on the bridge trying to save someone from killing himself and then the fantastic four all use their powers to save people, that action scene felt all wrong and ridiculous.The scene with the motocross and the human torch was also pointless.The movie suffers this tough criticism because it disappointed so many people so much.

What we really have here is a solidly put together superhero movie of the popcorn variety which will more than likely get the sequel it deserves, which unfortunately suffers from timing issues, having come out a whole three weeks after a movie named Batman Begins, which seems to be considered as one of if not the best superhero movie ever made. Since this is a different movie you can't really compare the two in my opinion. Performances are fair to excellent but this being the first movie of a possible series the various relationships have to be set up, and characters have to make sense within whatever story is presented. Origins of the heroes and villains need to be explained, which when you have 5 major characters plus the supporting people takes a whole load of time and you don't want your movie running much more than two hours. Writing seemed to make sense for what was there, but I'd be interested to see what happens in the next one now that the major relationships have been established. What was there was well presented it's just too bad that Batman Begins came out first to deservedly steal whatever thunder this was likely to generate. Again a decent way to fill two hours, just don't expect to be blown away.

First let me say that I love the Fantastic Four comic books. I know exactly what works and what doesn't. So I feel well qualified to evaluate this film.Secondly we need to address the issue of: Should a movie be 100% faithful to source material? Well, even if it were possible would you want the movie to be a carbon copy of the source material? Some things don't translate well to the screen. And sometimes (Harry Potter 1 *cough*) trying to be just like the original material is a bad idea! But when a character is fundamentally changed that's usually a bad idea. Fantastic Four takes many liberties with the characters some are worse than others. But a director and writer need to find the right medium that is a balance between the source and making a good movie. In this movie they changed the story around to try to make a better movie and failed! Perhaps they should have hired Goyer (Blade films, Batman Begins) to write the script, somebody who appreciates the original material.Fantastic Four is a film about a group of four people who are changed in a cosmic "accident" and form a Super-Hero team. The film tries to make it a movie about coping with change and family strife, which is in theory a good idea but fails here. We are presented with a film that tries many things and all of them feel half-done. The only things that saved the film and made me give it a 7/10 are the Ben Grimm parts of the story. We have somebody who is transformed into a monster and hates it. Also the movie tries to rush into the transformation, which is a good idea, but slows down right afterwards and just meanders forward.Overall: Not horrible. But if the people at FOX are reading this: You had a chance to make a great movie and blew it with a mediocre script, crappy director and over mediocrity!

Well, you weren't expecting greatness, were you? Regardless of what the wider public might be expecting from Fantastic Four, in internet circles it's been earmarked as the potential stinker amidst a promising summer since the first details leaked online. Unlike successful superhero franchises like X-Men and Spider-man, there's no respected director and no attempt to give the film a thematic depth or real world resonance. Where they had acting heavyweights, Fantastic Four has a couple of notable talents from successful TV series and a couple of almost-stars, with broad appeal but little charisma to bring to the mix. So the first question you might want answered is, "Is it awful?" Thankfully, no. Fantastic Four is simple, rather hollow, occasionally boring and then it's over. But it's hard to deny that, in places, it's also fairly entertaining.The story, changed from the source, sees five ludicrously-named scientists venturing into space to investigate a large cloud of special effects that has something to do with DNA. The team manage to get all their character back-stories, exposition-based conversations and marriage proposals out of the way in good time, before turning their attention to some rather vital defence shields. Too late, guys. Now you've been hit by the marauding cloud and you're back on earth (there wasn't much budget, it seems, for showing the there-and-back trips... space is but a quick cut away).The characters quickly discover their powers - team leader Reed Richards can stretch his limbs at will, Sue Storm can disappear and fire force fields, Johnny Storm can burn himself alive and whizz about the skies, and Ben Grimm turns to stone and breaks stuff. Cool? Nearly. There's an rather archaic nature to these superpowers - childhood dreams from a long gone era - but the film neatly modernises them by distracting us with some extreme sports. The kids might love it, but they're really only notable as the one place director Tim Story uses slow motion in the entire film. Rather proud, were we, of what looks like the only real stunt in the film not juiced up with CGI? And then there's the bad guy. Victor Von Doom was probably never born to do good, but now he's lost his money and his wife and turned into metal. So he's mightily annoyed, and while the world welcomes the Fantastic Four with open arms, he sets about doing some violence to people and eventually tries to take down the Four.Pretty slim on plot there, and the only gaps are taken up by scenes of the guys coming to terms with their new powers. Strangely, their initial response to them makes you wonder if they've seen the trailer - there's no sense of surprise. They barely seem to care until they leave the lab and return to New York.Johnny, with the flashiest abilities, is the only one to really embrace them, showing off and being rather endearing with it. The others are oh so desperate to get back to normal, which in the case of Reed and Sue seems rather stupid - they can do some cool stuff, but otherwise, pretty much live as normal Lucky them (although Reed, as the stretchy Mr Fantastic, could really do with the power to look convincingly attached to the rest of his body whenever he's stretching). The only character with real issues is Michael Chiklis' Grimm, clad in stone and called The Thing. Daily life becomes a problem for this rocky beast, but the film clamps him with a ludicrous subplot where his wife turns up at the scene of the gang's first act of heroism, and having seen her hubby save the lives of a fire engine full of FDNY guys, decides to hand back her wedding ring before even asking what's happened to the man she promised to love for ever. It's ludicrous, and makes The Thing's constant grump hard to connect with - sure, it might not be great to look like that, but met with her reaction, you'd expect him to develop a screw you attitude to the world and embrace his power for kicking holes in walls. A shame, really, because Chiklis' is the best performance in the movie by far, even as the film occasionally demeans the man who played Vic Mackey with bird crap jokes and suchlike.The proceedings have a rather slapped together feel (characters appear in the right places by coincidence and fill in plot holes for themselves) until the action kicks in, and almost all of it is crammed into the closing ten minutes. Between the FDNY-saving bridge set-piece (in glorious daytime, showing the limitations of some rather dreadful FX work) and the nighttime city-streets showdown, there's little to get you particularly excited - just super-heroic shoe-gazing. That said, the finale is rather satisfying, with Johnny's flaming acrobatics delivering some of the highs of Spider-man's web-slinging antics across Manhattan. The team join forces to defeat the bad guy and it's home time.Like X-Men, Fantastic Four feels rather like the setup for a sequel, now that the characters are in place. Sadly, where X-Men had a heart and a brain, Fantastic Four has some good-looking young actors showing plenty of flesh (although my highlight was Chiklis' wild forest of a bare chest, not Chris Evans' constantly-on-display gym-toned torso) and a bit of product placement where the emotional attachment should have been (Whopper, anyone?). At least X-Men's build up of characters made me want to know what happened to the mutants next. As for the Fantastic Four, pleasantly though they passed the time, I couldn't give care less about what the future holds for them.

Why people hate this movie this movie is so underrated

FANTASTIC FOUR Now honestly, I knew I couldn't expect much when I rented this movie, but all I wanted was stupid entertainment. But this movie was so terrible and simple that it was confusing.This has to be one of the most god-awful screenplays that Hollywood has ever produced. Being completely honest... I could have written a better screenplay and directed a better film.The Fantastic Four as a comic-book has enormous cinematic potential because it takes a group of super-heroes who are reluctantly thrust into their roles as super-humans... however, their stories are even stronger b/c of the honest and deep family dynamic they hold as a team.Every piece of that is lost in this translation to film. In order to set up a good franchise, they should have taken the time to explore who these people are before and during their mission to space. Reed's mission isn't described to the audience as anything deeper than "if we head into space and get a testing from a space cloud, we can help people live longer". That's honestly the most detailed description of his mission.And the dynamic between Reed and Sue Storm is never actually apparent between the actors... there are only random moments of dialogue that spoon feed the audience the most elementary tension between them.Basicall the film is a giant waste of a source material that could have made a great film. It's filled with implausibilities and unexplained errors... for example: - Why could Reed's every-day, cotton shirts stretch to unbelievable lengths along with his body? However, in order for Jessica Alba to become invisible she must strip off her clothes... yeah, very subtle... hot chick gets naked...What was the point of The Thing (Michael Chiklis) saving the one suicidal man on the bridge? B/C in the process of doing so he destroys about 10 cars and probably kills numerous people on the highway.How did The Thing manage to change himself back into his deformed self without anyone to push the button? - What was with all the BLATANT, BLATANT, BLATANT product placements? Pathetic.If they were in quarantine, how did Chris Evans managed to take that awful actress from ACCESS Hollywood not only out of the building... but in a ****ing helicopter on a huge mountain? Aside from all of this, the performances are awful. The only actor who comes out slightly unscathed is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/"Human Torch"... he obviously got to ad-lib some lines which gave him the best dialogue in the film. Jessica Alba is not only completely wrong for the role of Sue Storm (with a good screenplay this is the kind of role that should be played by Naomi Watts or Charlize Theron... she's supposed to be maternal and wise). Whoever played Mr. Fantastic should never work again. Micheal Chikless as The Thing offers one of the worst performances ever given while wearing such a ridiculous costume (The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were played better). And Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom wasn't scary for a single frame.I can't tell if it's all to blame on Tim Story, the director *cough cough. I can tell you this is about one of the least talented young directors working today... TAXI and FANTASTIC FOUR, greeeeat resume buddy.Honestly, I knew I couldn't expect much... but the universal awfulness of this movie was just ridiculous. Not once was it exciting, funny, or tense. It just wasted two hours of life. And it's extra disappointing b/c I can picture in my head how great of a film could have been made from the source material.Awww well... Hollywood blew a good opportunity and everyone involved made a fool of themselves doing so. Too bad.... F ...

And no I'm not talking about Jessica Alba here (I wonder why someone would think that? ;o) ... but seriously though, the two reasons why this movie worked for me and wasn't as bad as the critics made it sound are: Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans! Their "relationship" is the core or anchor of the movie. Before I go on, I also have to admit, that I don't know the FF comics that well, so any inaccuracy that might be in the movie, I can't point them out to you. One thing is for sure, if someone goes invisible, without clothes, that means you can't see them! (wouldn't have been PG-13 then also, right?) ;o) So while the movie has it's flaws (storyline/some action/characters/and so forth), it is still a nice/good enough movie to watch and it all comes down to two people! (there's also an unrated longer version out now on DVD, but I haven't seen that yet)

Not a fantastic 4 fan so never read the books. But me and my GF caught a closed screening of it and I thought it was a solid movie. Better than I expected. Its a lot like the spiderman movies because of humor but serious at the same time. A lot of laughs and some sad parts also.The movie begin with Reed, Sue, Johnny Storm, Ben and Doom going up into space to look for medical cures in a space cloud called the cosmic storm. The storm hits them and it gives them these strange powers. We seem them getting used to the new powers and using them to help regular people. They become celebrities in the public eye but there are many problems inside the team. Never seen superheroes fight like this but the Fantastic 4 bicker a lot. Ben and Johnny act like 5 yr olds and get into it bad at the x-games. Sue and Reed really love each other but reed is too distracted to pay her attention. And doctor doom turns them against each other and breaks the group up.A lot of romance in this movie more than the hulk or x-men. Ben looks like a monster and the public doesn't identify to him as much as the other 4. But a beautiful blind woman named alicia does and she helps him cope because she knows what its like to be outcast too. The actors who played these two characters were very good because of the touching scenes showing how terrible he felt because he was now a hideous monster while the rest of the 4 still look human. I felt sorry for his rejection and pain like wolverine said when his claws come out every time. The big love story is about Reed and Sue. They cant get on the same page for most of the movie and Doom thinks he owns Sue. But she rejects him for Reed and I wont spoil it all but the end is a very beautiful scene that was almost better than when MJ came back for Peter at the end of Spider-man 2. The actors all do a convincing job. My favourite was the wicked Julian Macmahon. Doom is one scary strange one who reminded me of the emperor in Sith but better looking. Some of his lines were weak but it did not come off cheesy because of the way he said them and acted. He's the villain but you admire him since he is suave and intimidating. Was also impressed with Alba. She has come a long way since dark angel. I liked her in Sin City but this movie showed she is more than a sex symbol. Some don't think shes a good actress but she did a very great job here. She and Iaon Gruffud are really good together.I thought it was good. Story could have been a bit more complex but the actors, direction and effects make up for it, and the Human Torch is impressive to see on the big screen. 9/10.

Because of the overwhelming barrage of unfavorable reviews, I went into "Fantastic Four" with very low expectations. I was still utterly disappointed with what I saw. It is probably the worst movie based on a comic book that I've ever seen (having not yet had the pleasure of sitting through "Elektra" or "Catwoman"). Prior to "Fantastic Four" I would've awarded this "honor" to "Daredevil," but alas (Yes, I'm sorry to say) "Fantastic Four" is even worse.First off, it moves far too quickly. I don't mean that the movie is just a collection of action sequences strung together (although there is little or no plot to connect one scene to the next). In fact, there is very little action in the movie. What I mean is that the pace of the film is too rushed. The line readings, for example, are delivered much too fast. The director should've varied the pace a bit more, particularly in the so-called "dramatic" scenes.I don't think the movie was very well cast either. The performances are embarrassingly bad. They go from flat and dull one second to over-the-top and obnoxious the next (the worst offender being the amazingly stiff and lifeless Jessica Alba). The only actor who seems to bring any degree (no matter how small) of subtlety or depth to his character is Michael Chiklis. Perhaps the actors simply did the best they could with what they had to work with, because the characters are uninteresting, unsympathetic and, at times, flat-out annoying (especially Chris Evans' hotshot thrill-seeking "Human Torch").The only thing worse than the pace, the characterizations and the performances was the writing. The dialogue is incredibly shallow and obvious. Practically every line is a cliché. Here's a small sample:"You're such a dork, Reed." "Which of you is the leader?" "Johnny, say you're sorry." "You two need a time-out." "He started it." "You need to control yourself. Think before you act." "Nothing personal." "Being different isn't always bad." "We're all in this together." "I can't hold it!" "Ya done good, kid."The special effects aren't really that special. At times they work just fine. At other times they look very cartoonish and unbelievable. The score, by the usually reliable John Ottman, is uninspired and, quite frankly, very corny. The choice of songs for the movie were also pretty bad. The direction is sadly lacking in any artistic vision or style. Having previously done comedies like "Taxi" and "Barbershop," Tim Story just doesn't seem to demonstrate the natural grasp for the material that Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer does.Speaking in very broad, generalizing terms, those are just some of the problems I had with the movie. To get more specific, however, I would have to give away a few spoilers. If you haven't yet seen the film, and still plan to, you may want to skip over this next section. *SPOILERS*Despite the fact that throughout the film they continue to search for an explanation, it is never revealed how or why the space storm arrives early.After his transformation, Ben calls his girlfriend from a payphone outside his home. He asks her to come outside, which she does... in her negligee (despite the fact that it's nighttime).When Ben inadvertently causes a pile-up on a bridge, his three friends just happen to arrive on that same bridge at the very moment the accidents begin to occur. On the bridge, Reed Richards tells Sue Storm he and Chris can't get past the police to help Ben, but (because of her invisibility) she can. She immediately turns invisible, removes her undergarments and gets by the police, but then so do Reed and her brother. What was the point then of her turning invisible and stripping (besides the obvious reason of providing the audience with a brief glimpse at Jessica Alba's body)? Ben's girlfriend also goes to the trouble of coming to the bridge and pushing her way through the crowd simply to return a ring to Ben. She takes it off, places it on the street and walks away without saying a word. In the scene that immediately follows, Chris sardonically asks Ben, "Where are your ears?" Considering the man just lost his love, he couldn't show just a bit more understanding?The films establishes that Ben weighs close to 700 pounds (he can stall an elevator and leave footprints in the pavement). Yet, in the climatic fight scene, he slides off the hood of a car without even leaving a scratch, let alone a dent.*END OF SPOILERS*Overall, I'd say the movie was very sloppily and carelessly put together. Things are set up but never paid off. Significant questions are posed but never answered. The movie had potential but never even came close to realizing it. My advice to improve "Fantastic Four" would've been a complete overhaul of the script (probably by some different writers), a different director and, aside from Michael Chiklis, a different cast.

This movie is very enjoyable like it don't need a dark tone and Dr.Doom looks better. I'd wish I watch the 90s one even though it didn't age well but still I want to. At least the characters are likable then Fant4stic because the characters in the movie are lifeless while in this film there not boring. I know the film is not the best but I have a good time with it

I was very upset at hearing that Director Tim Story was helming this project. Knowing his past works (Taxi & barbershop) and the past failed attempts with this title, I was not confident in his ability to tell this story.I WAS WRONG.The story and Character development of this project were tight and the special effects were awesome as well. There are some aspects of the film that I still cal into question (Jessica Alba has neither the age or the depth for the sue storm Character) but I understand certain concessions of making a large budget studio project. (Besides ALBA IS HOT, especially in the skin tight blue suit) All in all, I say "Good work Mr. Story" I'm sorry for doubting you>

This movie is just so BORING! The actors are cheesecake and the whole thing is so predictable. The special effects aren't so special, nothing of interest happens for the first hour and a half. It reminded me of the old joke:"Man goes into the butchers and asks for a pound of bacon, the butcher asks 'Lean back?' so the man leans back and asks for a pound of bacon."Not funny, not clever and wholly predictable Batman. The experience of watching this movie reminded me of watching the Hulk and I only ever wanted to do that once in my lifetime.If you have nothing better to do than watch this movie then do nothing.When is Hollywood going to stop force feeding us these toothpaste advertising "actors"? Someone save us from the shiny happy people.
