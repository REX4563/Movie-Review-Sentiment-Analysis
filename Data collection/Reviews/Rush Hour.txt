When the daughter of the Chinese consul in Los Angeles is kidnapped he wants his old friend Detective Inspector Lee, of the Hong Kong Police, to be part of the investigation. The FBI don't want him anywhere near their investigation so palm him off to the LAPD which in turn partners him with Detective James Carter, who has no current partner because he annoys everybody else in the department. Carter is initially pleased with the assignment but soon learns that he is just expected to babysit Lee and keep him away from the case; Lee is equally unimpressed and is determined that he must help find his friends daughter. Inevitably it isn't that long before the pair are investigating the case and the FBI are thinking they are getting in the way.This film's story is decent enough even if the big reveal about who is ultimately behind the kidnapping is rather spoilt for anybody who reads who is starring in the film at the start anybody appearing third is surely not only going to have one brief scene in the opening minutes! That isn't much of a problem though; this is all about the laughs not the depth of the mystery. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are a lot of fun in the lead roles; they provide lots of laughs and develop a good chemistry as the film progresses. The action is well choreographed, as one would expect from anything featuring Jackie Chan; it might not be as intense as that in his Hong Kong films but that is partly to give room to the fast talking Chris Tucker to provide more verbal laughs. Overall I found this to be a fun mix of action and comedy which manages to avoid the sort of offensive material that might put off many viewers.

This movie is pure comedy from the beginning to the end. You will have a good laugh thanks to Chris Tucker in his role of Carter, a clumsy LA cop. The city of Los Angeles is spectacular and is a great scenario for this entertaining movie. Jackie Chan at its best kicking asses everywhere with an outstanding humble attitude. I think Americans love Jackie Chan because he's so nice and great person.The main reason why I like this movie is the wonderful duo they play, constantly arguing, while walking around exciting California, USA, about everything, but in the meantime they are loyal partners. The great diversity there is in America singles out in a city like Los Angeles when we go through Chinatown. And fortunately, the movie brings us out there. Interesting cultures melt into a huge variety of ethnicities that make anything possible to happen. This is why America is so interesting and wonderful and we from abroad love her as a beautiful land.All in all, this is a worth-seeing Hollywood movie and probably you would like to watch it several times!

Even though this movie might be a bit conventional, it's thoroughly entertaining, with nice action scenes, cool martial arts fighting & a good sense of humor. I didn't find any of it boring. It's a good concept, to combine the humor of Chris Tucker with the martial arts of Jackie Chan. This movie is for anyone who's into action, martial arts & humor. 7/10

I wanted to give it one or two more stars but it just wasn't doing it for me. A solid hour and thirty minute buddy cop genre. It's exactly what you'd expect and nothing more. The fighting scenes were decent enough, the story was predictable but not in a bad way and the comedy aged a little poorly.1998 me would have laughed till I cried. 2022 me didn't care for it as much but that's okay. I've never watched the other Rush Hour films but I may give them a shot since this was a good foundation. I'd even argue that the gag reel at the end was better than the film itself. With that said it's a good little time capsule of what action films were in the late 90s.

Obviously, "Rush Hour" is mostly just another buddy comedy, but there's so much hilarious dialogue between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, that it's all worthwhile. When a consul's daughter gets kidnapped, Tucker gets hired to take the case, but Chan gets brought in from Hong Kong to assist. Naturally, they have a very hard time cooperating.I guess that a major aspect of these movies is that you shouldn't try to take them seriously; just accept them as completely crazy. With Chan doing his martial arts and Tucker being a loudmouth, it's a great time from start to finish. Also starring Elizabeth Pena, Chris Penn, and Tom Wilkinson. I liked the sequel equally.

I have memories of seeing this way back (in the theater no less) and enjoying myself. Guns, stunts, Hong Kong action, it was everything an uncultured teenager needed.Now while Chris Tucker's Eddie-Murphy-on-speed shtick gets old quickly for adult me, there's nothing like a Jackie Chan action scene. I don't care how much rehearsing and safeguards go into his stuntwork, that stuff is still exciting today.How they squeezed a franchise outta this is beyond me, but it's a serviceable buddy cop movie.

Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are a great comedic duo in this exciting buddy cop adventure. Jackie Chan, in particular, has fantastic comedic timing and is a true treasure. The plot is pretty straightforward, but it's more so about the chemistry between Tucker and Chan, which definitely delivers. Rush Hour is a classic entry in the buddy cop genre.

The Chinese consul to America has had his daughter kidnapped and the kidnapper wants $50M. To help find his daughter he requests Detective Lee (Jackie Chan) from Hong Kong. The FBI doesn't want an outside agency sniffing around their active situation, so they request a liaison (babysitter) from the LAPD. For the role of tour guide the LAPD sends them Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker).Carter is a loud mouth, a braggart, and generally annoying to everyone he encounters. If anything has gone wrong then usually he is the culprit. Lee is the straight man. He's by the book and he's highly effective. The two of them are trying to find Juntao, a crimelord from China who has brought his criminal ways to America. If they can find him, then they might just be able to find the consul's daughter.This was a breakout movie for both actors. Chan had been around a lot longer than Tucker doing mostly Hong Kong movies, but he'd never had a hit like this one before. Tucker had "Friday," "Dead Presidents," and "Money Talks" to his credit; good movies, but not blockbusters. Yes this may be another buddy cop movie, but Chris Tucker is hilarious. And that's the difference.

If you want to see a lot of action -- dishes smashed, bullets through walls, falling bodies, bodies crashing through windows without a scratch, hot pursuits in automobiles, buildings exploding -- this is your movie.Jackie Chan is a detective brought from Hong Kong to help recover the snatched daughter of the Chinese Consule in Los Angeles. The FBI are handling the case and they figure Chan will be a nuisance so they assign a devalued cop from the L.A.P.D., Chris Tucker, to nursemaid the visitor and keep him out of the way. It all goes wrong.The plot doesn't need much description because it's of no importance. It only provides an excuse to hang the violent scenes on. But this isn't one of those cop movies that have realistic gore all over the place. For all the action, nobody shows much blood, and after they're finished swinging from fire escapes they're not breathing very hard, let alone panting, let alone dead as you and I would be.It's not a serious picture. It's an attempt at comedy. Chris Tucker is a clone of Eddy Murphy at his loudest and most grotesque. Jackie Chan has trouble with English but he makes up for it by combining the acrobatic ability of Burt Lancaster with the choreographic skills of Gene Kelly. You ought to see the guy roll and twist over furniture or rooftops or vehicles. It's superhuman, literally. He must have used wires.The gags are okay without being as spectacular as the stunts. What it is, is another mismatched cop movie, out of "48 Hours" by "Lethal Weapon" and "Black Rain." A gang bang.

The young daughter of a Chinese diplomat is kidnapped. He insists that the FBI use his trusted Hong Kong detective Lee (Jackie Chan). However the FBI dumps him on LAPD detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) to babysit.Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker form a great team. Their chemistry is evident right away. Brett Ratner brings out all the hilarity with some culture clash humor and loudmouth Tucker.The story is passable. There isn't anything original going on here. It's really just an excuse for Chris Tucker to make an ass of himself, and allow Jackie Chan to do some crazy fighting moves.

One of my all time favorite movies. The dynamic duo of Chan and Tucker is timeless, you can watch over and over and still laugh. The LA laid back vibe of James Carter paired with the by the book badass ninja of Lee makes for an awesome experience. The most quotable movie of all time, "it's not you all, it's y'all"

This film has aged very well and I can even argue it to be Jackie Chan's best role. Chan is probably at his peak in this one. And Chris Tucker! Where the heck is he? We need a million and one films with Chris Tucker in them! How can Tucker not be all over the place by now?

This film is good, entertaining and all round fun. Chris Tucker makes it, without him it would just be another thin action film. But his barrier breaking is great to watch and the chemistry between Chan and him are great.

This is the start of rush hour, and is very funny, have alot of jokes and a good script. So yes, is a classic already.

I had pretty high hopes for Rush Hour, partly because of all the positive reactions it got in the States.  I even heard claims like "the best Jackie Chan ever".  I was suspicious of Tucker, but as long as it was the new Chan movie it ought to be okay.Right ?Wrong !I found myself forced into one of the most annoying fake interracial buddy-buddy action/comedy blockbusters I have ever had the displeasure to had to sit through.Rush Hour is nothing more than a Chris Tucker Star Vehicle with Jackie reduced to a "Chinaman" sidekick.  That's all good and fine if you're under such heavy medication that you think Tucker is actually funny but after two minutes of him doing his little Eddie Murphy rip off routine I was ready to climb on a rooftop with an AK-47 and let justice rain from the sky.Throw in a mentally challenged plot, bad acting, the old "where did all the money from the big budget go ?" complaint and a director who couldn't direct an action scene to save his life and you got this feature length misery.If you're ready to see a real Jackie Chan movie, go to your local video-shop and rent Operation Condor.  Better still, you can rent any Chan title, it'll be better than this bowels loosener.Vote: 1

Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, the best comedic duo since Lethal Weapon bring us Rush Hour. A classic action movie that brings great action as well as awesome comedy that makes you laugh every minute. Chris Tucker has always been one of my favorite comedians, even before I saw Rush Hour, so it was great to see him in Rush Hour. I know a lot of people find him annoying, but I thought he was just so funny. He showed off his talents in Rush Hour. Not only him, but this is the film that is making Jackie Chan into a world wide super star. His stunts are simply incredible. Rush Hour is one of those very fun action/comedy movies that I'm sure you'll enjoy if you love movies like Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours. The story was just pure entertainment and really kept me on the edge.Lee is a body guard to the Chinese ambassador and is also a close friend, he also is a teacher to his daughter, Soo Yong. The ambassador goes to the United States with his daughter, but she is kidnapped by an evil man of the Chinese Consol. They want 50 million dollars in return, but the ambassador thinks that Lee should be involved, so he sends for him, but the F.B.I. doesn't want him near the case. So they hire L.A.P.D. screw up, James Carter, to babysit him. But together, the fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west, they must learn to work together despite their complete opposite personalities and get the girl back.Rush Hour is a guaranteed classic down the lines somewhere, I'm sure. It's already spawned a sequel and it's been a success. Chris and Jackie are such a great team, I was really impressed with their chemistry. My favorite scene is where Lee plays "War" by Edwin Starr in Carter's car, and he doesn't know how to say the lyrics correctly, and Carter shows him some moves, it was such a classic scene that brought me down to the floor laughing. I highly recommend Rush Hour, it's all in good fun and it'll give you more than a few good laughs.8/10

I enjoyed Rush Hour very much, yes it is a little silly, but what it is really is harmless fun. The two leads, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are an inspired double act, though I will say, that sometimes Tucker's mouth runs away with him, so I didn't always understand what he was saying at times. The clever plot, involving an international kidnapping, actually allows Chan to do what he does best, but I did wish there was a little more of it. The script is irreverent, if only let down by what seemed like some improvisation from Tucker, that sometimes got off target. There are some excellent camera work and stunts, making this a hugely enjoyable film, not as good as Shanghai Noon, but a delight for fans of Chan. 8/10 Bethany Cox.

I love a good buddy-cop flick and it'd been quite some time since I'd seen one, so when I saw this floating around on Hulu I knew I needed to rectify passing on it for so many years. Chan and Tucker make for a great pair, and while the story here is pretty generic, it's their chemistry that keeps you glued. Come for the jokes and fun action sequences, not the story.

Obviously, "Rush Hour" is mostly just another buddy comedy, but there's so much hilarious dialogue between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, that it's all worthwhile.

Rush Hour is fast, funny and Fantastic. It is 2 hours of non stop entertainment. I have seen the sequel, No where near the Classic. Jackie Chan is amazing as the martial arts expert cop from Hong Kong. Chris Tucker is Hilarious as the fast talking cop from America. What happens when two people like this meet, Excitement and entertainment. This is Jackie's Best Hollywood Movie. I have seen a few Chris Tucker movie, this is his Best performance. I hope the third in the series will entertain as the First. If you have not seen this movie, then i recommend this movie. A great action comedy movie for all type of audience to enjoy. One of the best cop buddy movies since Lethal Weapon.

And that's the difference.

Hugely disappointing waste of Jackie Chan's talents, this film should be avoided like the plague.  Being an enormous Jackie Chan fan I had very high hopes for this.  It has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever.  Chris Tucker is the most irritating man on the planet bar none and unfortunately Jackie is reduced to the role of amusing little foreign man which is unforgiveable.  The stunts and action sequences are forgettable, coming as secondary to the dreadful interaction between the two main stars.I feel quite gutted that Jackie Chan's bit Western break has come to this and it is sad that most people will be introduced to his vast talents with this truly awful film.

This martial arts movie was action packed and funny. Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan make a great team in this movie. Jackie Chan brings the action and Chris Tucker brings the comedy. The fight scenes are awesome and it has a great story to it. I recommend that people should see this movie if you haven't yet. You'll enjoy it.

Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker gave a great performance playing against each other and then deciding to join forces together and fight the real bad dudes in Los Angeles. Jackie Chan, (Chief Inspector Lee),"San Wa",'05, visits the LAPD and is assigned a so called FBI pal, Chris Tucker,(Detective James Carter),"Jackie Brown",'97, who finds out the job he is assigned to is like a Babysitter for Inspector Lee. There is plenty of action and car chases as Lee is trying to locate a missing little gal who gets into the hands of some very bad dudes and there is plenty of people being killed through out the entire picture. This is a very entertaining film with lots of laughs and drama.

This is the start of rush hour, and is very funny, have alot of jokes and a good script. So yes, is a classic already.

Most of the jokes aren't funny, but Chris Tucker's comedic timing is impeccable, and Jackie Chan's physical comedy is delightful. Overall, besides the charismatic duo, everything else in Rush Hour is passable.

This film has aged very well and I can even argue it to be Jackie Chan's best role. Chan is probably at his peak in this one. And Chris Tucker! Where the heck is he? We need a million and one films with Chris Tucker in them! How can Tucker not be all over the place by now?

This is a fun movie that puts the pairing of two men with great screen presence over the story. Fortunately for the filmmakers it works. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, in a Murphy/Nolte 48 Hours' vibe, are paired to rescue a young kidnap victim from Asia, who is a Consulate's daughter. Chan is a serious and seasoned Police officer from the East and Tucker a wise-cracking LAPD Detective. The pairing sets up the ability to showcase Chan's ignorance of California and his martial arts fight skills. Chan is infinity likable in this attempt to further capitalize on his popularity in the West. Tucker is funny but his delivery and lack of authenticity wore thin for me. This one set the stage for a series of films, but this one is the best.

One of my all time favorite movies. The dynamic duo of Chan and Tucker is timeless, you can watch over and over and still laugh. The LA laid back vibe of James Carter paired with the by the book badass ninja of Lee makes for an awesome experience. The most quotable movie of all time, "it's not you all, it's y'all"

Well, let's just be honest here and say that the 1998 movie "Rush Hour" is definitely a classic action comedy of East meets West.Writers Ross LaManna and Jim Kouf managed to put together a story that incorporated elements of action and comedy in a very entertaining manner. And it was a story that was as entertaining as it was enjoyable as director Brett Ratner brought the story to the screen.Initially, back when the movie was first released, I was a bit skeptical about pitching Jackie Chan opposite of Chris Tucker, but the duo actually worked out well together, as they are quite the opposite of one another and the chemistry between the two just was marvelous on the screen. Whereas Chris Tucker brings the more classic comedy to the movie, in the likes of Eddie Murphy in "Beverly Hills Cop", Jackie Chan brought his usual impressive action feats and stunts while managing to put in his usual charm and comedy elements as well."Rush Hour" definitely has an interesting cast ensemble. Aside from Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, the movie also has the likes of Tom Wilkinson, Chris Penn and Tzi Ma on the cast list.Not only is the storyline and plot entertaining and fun, but the dialogue was also good, especially the banter between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.This is a fast-paced and entertaining action comedy for sure, and it is one that manages to endure the passing of time. I have watched the movie numerous times since it was initially released back in 1998, and it actually still holds up here late in 2020.If you are not familiar with the "Rush Hour" movies, then I can more than warmly and highly recommend that you sit down and strap yourself in as you embark on a fast paced action ride in the company of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.My rating of "Rush Hour" is a seven out of ten stars. This movie provides good and solid entertainment.

I had pretty high hopes for Rush Hour, partly because of all the positive reactions it got in the States.  I even heard claims like "the best Jackie Chan ever".  I was suspicious of Tucker, but as long as it was the new Chan movie it ought to be okay.Right ?Wrong !I found myself forced into one of the most annoying fake interracial buddy-buddy action/comedy blockbusters I have ever had the displeasure to had to sit through.Rush Hour is nothing more than a Chris Tucker Star Vehicle with Jackie reduced to a "Chinaman" sidekick.  That's all good and fine if you're under such heavy medication that you think Tucker is actually funny but after two minutes of him doing his little Eddie Murphy rip off routine I was ready to climb on a rooftop with an AK-47 and let justice rain from the sky.Throw in a mentally challenged plot, bad acting, the old "where did all the money from the big budget go ?" complaint and a director who couldn't direct an action scene to save his life and you got this feature length misery.If you're ready to see a real Jackie Chan movie, go to your local video-shop and rent Operation Condor.
