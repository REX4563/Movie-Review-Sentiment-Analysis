While several portions of this movie were textbook cliché, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. Usually I don't bother with mainstream, commercial movies that are so obviously and unabashedly manufactured to sell to a teenage audience, but I had seen Channing Tatum in She's the Man (another movie that I was hesitant to see, but didn't regret it afterward), and thought he was absolutely gorgeous! Step Up would not have been as good as it was without him. He made even some of the more awkward lines of the script sound original and I really enjoyed watching him bust a move. Several parts were genuinely amusing and heart-warming despite the well-worn story of a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who falls in love with the uptight rich dancer. Overall, it was pure fluffy entertainment, like Save the Last Dirty Dancing. Just don't go in expecting much or analyze it too deeply and you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

"I'm fighting, for something that's real for the first time in my life!"When Anne Fletcher made her directorial debut way back in 2006 no one imagined that this small budget film with a relatively unknown cast would end up grossing over 100 million in the US and inspiring a franchise that currently stands at five movies. It wasn't received warmly by the critics due to its cliché storyline and corny dialogues, but audiences dug it. I never was interested in the franchise and this was my first time actually sitting down and watching one. The main reason was because I knew this was Channing Tatum's break out role. He had done a couple of movies before with smaller roles, but this was the first time he was given a lead role. Tatum has delivered some strong roles recently (Foxcatcher being his most impressive) so I wanted to go back and revisit some of his earlier work. I was surprised I actually ended up enjoying this film as much as I did and I think it is largely due to Tatum's charisma. He didn't deliver a great performance, but he definitely carried the film with his charm making it enjoyable. The dancing was also pretty solid although I am not much of an expert in that area. The main problems with Step Up revolve around the clichéd screenplay and dull subplots that almost derailed the film completely, but the charisma from Tatum and his excellent chemistry with Jenna Dewan make this an entertaining viewing experience. It's been 9 years since Tatum and Dewan met on set for this movie and they are still together in real life. The chemistry was really there. Step Up is one of those films that you know is formulaic, unoriginal, and without any great technical achievements, but you still find it enjoyable due to the charismatic lead performances. You could file Step Up under the romance/dance genre along with other films as Bring it On, Save the Last Dance, and Honey. The screenplays are perhaps the weakest thing about these films, but you still can find them enjoyable when the lead characters deliver charismatic performances and know how to dance. That is the case with Channing Tatum who plays a troubled young teen who lives with his foster parents and spends a lot of time in the streets. One night out with his friends he ends up vandalizing an arts school and gets caught. He is ordered to do 200 hours of community service as payment for the damages he caused. At the school he meets a young student from a wealthy family played by Jenna Dewan who dreams of becoming a dancer. When her dancing partner gets injured, he offers to help, and the plot evolves from there.The story works best when it focuses on the two lead characters rehearsing and dancing together, but when the film shifts its focus on other subplots revolving around their friends the story losses some of its appeal. There is unnecessary conflict introduced in the film that is resolved rather easily and in a predictable way. There is also a tragic scene that takes place near the end of the film that felt out of place (the melodrama is poorly handled by the screenwriters). However, the final dance scene is one of the best in the movie so it does end in a positive note. Despite its predictable storyline and formulaic premise, Step Up is still an enjoyable film. Not good enough however to get me interested in the sequels.

The movie has the cliché's all over it. It is a tried and true formula of a down and out urban kid meeting up with the privileged kid and each learning something from the other. There is awkwardness in the beginning and the story hurdles are conveniently resolved quickly. But, you know, this still is one fun movie. The music is infectious and the leads are both good looking, likable and relate able.The store is one that we have seen before, but there is no real harm done here. It is a movie that can actually be shown to church youth groups without fear of having to edit out swear words or nude scenes. In fact, the film for the most part is free of all that and yet still remains entertaining! Imagine that.As my summary states; this is hardly a step down, it definitely isn't a "step up", but you know, it does a great side step that will entertain you enough not to mind the cost of a matinée ticket. It isn't an after 6pm movie by no means, but still, worth at least one glance in the theater.

Music and choreography in 'Step Up' are one of the best in quality and in entertainment perspective. Not only the senior showcase piece at the ending, but choreography throughout the movie is also well coordinated such as 'Till the Dawn' in the club and 'Show Me the Money' in opening credits.What impresses me the most is that two genres come together to create synergy, so much better than when one stands alone. This perfect coexistence is not only in story but also in music and choreography. Rich girl and poor boy; classic and hip-hop; and ballet/jazz dance and street/freestyle dance. Great harmonization in music and choreography is significant because they resemble, symbolize, and signify the relationship between protagonists.I also want to compliment the chemistry between two actors while I also want to point out the story's resemblance with 'Save the Last Dance' and too many coincidences.

Funny jokes. Handsome actors. Pretty actresses. A good soundtrack. Add dancing, and voilà, another hit teen movie full of romance, tragedy, and drama. Although predictable, Sep Up is a beautifully choreographed movie with an upbeat soundtrack that brings even more fun to the theater.Tyler (Channing Tatum) is not a bad kid. No, he just lives in a foster home in the poor, tough section of the city of Baltimore. Tyler becomes caught up in a bad situation and must complete 200 hours of community service at the scene of the crime, The Maryland School of the Arts. During his time washing windows and cleaning clarinets, Tyler notices Nora. Nora Clark (Jenna Diwam), an accomplished dance from the school, is practicing for her senior showcase. A problem arises when her dance partner breaks his leg and cannot practice with her anymore. Tyler, eyeing up his chance to talk with Nora and not wanting to see his opportunity go out the window he is washing, puts on his shining armor and mounts his white horse. When Nora rejects his proposal to help her at practice, Tyler is hurt (who wouldn't want to leap blindly into the arms of the kid who trashed you school's stage, your temple?). Finally, after realizing that her situation called for desperate measures, and after spying on Tyler and seeing him dance hip-hop outside the school with his friends, Nora decides to employ his help. The romance that sparks between Tyler and Nora during the long hours of practice after school is predictable and stale. However, the amazing dancing and upbeat music makes a predictable ending acceptable.When I sat down to watch this movie, I was prepared for another boring plot and was surprised by the creativeness and genius in the opening scene. The scene alternates between a hip-hop/rap beat and a slower, more classical piece. Both shots include dancers performing at their best. The hip-hop dancers attend a crowded, dark party. They wear sharp, high-heels. In contrast to this picture, ballerinas dance in an open, bright studio with ballet slippers on their feet. This could symbolize the double life Tyler leads. During the day he is a disciplined ballet dancer, but morphs into a car-stealing Mr. Hyde at night. The director's (Anne Flethcer) alternating shots show how living in the city can be sharp like the woman's heel, and how Tyler and his best friend Mac (Damaine Radcliff) think that the rich kids who attend the school (actually most attend on grants or scholarships) lead a softer, easier life, like that of a ballet slipper. Cultural differences may seem to separate these people, but as we learn, forgiveness and love know no boundaries.We root for Tyler and Nora throughout the entire movie. The scenes in which Tyler and Nora dance together are vibrant and fun, inviting the audience to jump out of their seats and join in; there aren't any rules.Although the plot was predictable and the acting regular, Step Up achieved its main propose: to entertain me for an hour and a half. If you are a dancer, musician, underdog, or someone who wants to hear a good story about "stepping up" to the world, Step Up is a film made for you.

In Baltimore, the troublemaker and street dancer Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) lives with his foster parents in an Afro-American lower class neighborhood. His best friends are Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny Carter (De'Shawn Washington) and they use to hang around together, going to parties and stealing cars. After being expelled of a party, the trio breaks in the Maryland School of Arts and commits vandalism, destroying the stage. Tyler is arrested and sentenced to 200 hours of community service in the school and Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) assigns him to help the janitor cleaning the place. One afternoon, the ballet dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) sees Tyler dancing in the parking area and when her partner Andrew (Tim Lacatena) has a strain and Tyler offers to help her in the choreography, she accepts the offer; they rehearsal and become close to each other while Tyler becomes friend of the students Miles Darby (Mario) and Lucy Avila (Drew Sidora). When Andrew returns, Tyler that is known for quitting everything he starts gives up dancing and leaves Nora alone. After an incident, Tyler has to decide to follow his dream or return to his life of rebel loser. "Step Up" was a wonderful and delightful surprise for me. The heartwarming romantic story shows a perfect chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, supported by a magnificent cast and awesome songs and choreographies of dance. There are also drama and tragedy, funny moments and I recalled Alan Parker's "Fame" and "Center Stage" with the students following their dreams in an art school. The characters are nice, the actors and actresses are excellent and I have really loved this movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Ela Dança, Eu Danço" ("She Dances, I Dance")

OK. It wasn't the best made movie in the entire world. But which movies nowadays do? All good possible stories have been thought of, especially dance movies. So why not mix all the movies together to make a good movie? I saw a lot of movies in this film, and all those movies I enjoyed. I found this story funny, romantic, and the dance moves were superb. The only thing I didn't like about it was Tyler Gage's character wasn't fully shown (his personality). I thought that the two of them had chemistry and I wish my boyfriend knew how to dance now. It inspired me to dance, which I used to, and regret that I quit now having watched it. I thought this story was really balanced out with comedy, thrills, romance, and good music also! Definitely going to buy this movie when it is out of theaters.

Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the "drama" scenes more bearable. The leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.All in all, a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences, and this movie is MUCH MUCH MUCH better than "You Got Served" in terms of the plot and drama. Then again, that doesn't say much, does it? =P

people keep talking about how awful "step up" was, or how it was such a waste of money. but now here are my two cents. it was, in fact, a good movie. the dancing was FABULOUS, and even though the acting could have improved, this movie was nothing short of amazing. the music was catchy and hot, and there was just enough romance in it to make it cute but not gross or sleazy. it had literally EVERYTHING you could ask for in a movie: romance, drama, comedy, and it was even slightly scary at some parts, too. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan did a great job. their dancing, along with everyone else's, was phenomenal. when i left the movie, i was actually inspired to be a dancer (even though i never will be.) the main reason people are turning down this movie is because of the acting. sure, the acting could have been better, but this movie was focusing on the DANCING. obviously you have to be a good actor to be in a movie, but the dancing was the main focus of this film. and i personally think the dancing was great. i couldn't ask for it to be better. this movie is definitely worth seeing, whether you're into hip-hop or not.

The movie itself wasn't too bad it was just boring. There was no action, nothing big happens.I went to this movie for the break dancing because i thought i looked cool, but if you want to see a movie about dancing, You Got Served is better. Most of the same stuff happens, but You Got Served is more exciting.Personally, i think Step Up is more of a movie to rent for a night than to see in the theater.step up = chick flickbad things- 1. no action/boring 2. more of a chick flick 3. not that great dancinggood things- 1. good portrayal of modern life (lowerclass, upperclass 2. good story line

Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. The scenery was good and the characters held true to life. It is worth the watch if you like that kind of film.

Tyler Gage is a white kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Helping his friends escape, Tyler is caught red handed smashing up a school of the arts and is sentenced to community service there. While doing janitorial work he sees the ballet students doing their routines and he himself is later observed by one of the students (Nora) doing his street moves with his friends. When Nora's partner goes out with an injury she turns to Tyler to help her, since he has basic skills. Both have their struggles with this working relationship but while Nora opens up Tyler to the possibilities through dance, he brings an unique urban feel to her routine – but as romance blossoms things become harder.I never bothered with this film when it came out but the rising star of Tatum made me step back and take a look at this. What I found was a film that struck me as being a mass produced product rather than being a film that someone created or that the makers really wanted to make. What I mean is that didn't seem to be much in the way of passion or inspiration behind it. The story is a predictable mishmash of other films and you can see so many things from Breakin' through to Save the Last Dance all in the mix here. It is definitely something that knows what it needs to do, does it and doesn't worry too much about making it special, different or anything like that. And so it treads the path you know it will from the first minute and as a story it never rings true so much as just meeting it with a shrug.In fairness though the dance routines are reasonably good and the soundtrack does give it an energy that helps it but both of these things are the type of things that will fade with time as other films supersede it. The cast do the basics as well. Tatum is good in so much as he manages to carry off a white urban caricature without looking ridiculous. In the normal terms he is not "good" but on these terms he does the job. Dewan is attractive but you never feel the heat between them and their relationship (working or romantic) never seems real. The rest of the cast are pretty much doing what one expects as well – and when even Six Feet Under's Griffiths or The Wire's Lovejoy is calling it in, it hardly seems fair to expect Mario to be doing much.Overall this is a product more than it is a film and as such it is one of those things that does what the packaging says it does but doesn't innovate, doesn't excite and doesn't appear to have had much creative input into it apart from the final packaging. It is a solid genre film for the viewers it was made for but it is unlikely to stand the test of time well at all or indeed have much appeal to those that want it to do more than tick boxes.

The story of Step Up is simple and predictable. I just like one particular scene when the leading actor and actress dance over the harbor. Their dancing with the beautiful sunset and the sultry music, is truly impressive. If you like this movie, you may like Center Stage: Turn it Up too. There are resemblances between them. Overall, they are the kind of movies that are good to see when you're bored on a lazy day.

Step Up is more than just a fun movie, it's a real movement! It's right at the heart of the dance revolution flicks premiering towards the turn of the new millennium with Honey (2003) starring Jessica Alba of course then You Got Served (2004) cranked it up a notch then this in 2006 and Stomp the Yard (2007) shook things up the next year and you can even credit Center Stage (2000) way back in the day for starting it all!Step Up plays like a mixtape of some of your favorite hip-hop jams of the 2000s with Petey Pablo, T.I. and Ciara all contributing along the way and a great title track while R&B singers Mario and Drew Sidora actually show up to the party and kill it giving great performances!Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan interlude all of the cool, hot dance action with an inspiring and powerful true life love story that you just don't usually see play out onscreen as the main attraction. Dewan and Tatum fell in love in Step Up and that's definitely what makes this movie so special. They share genuine chemistry and they're so gorgeous together you can easily see why Tatum fell for her Jenna's amazingly beautiful and so sweet! Their love will last forever! Channing and Jenna split last year and they are no longer together, did you hear? I love Step Up! I love Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan too! I love dancing! And music!'ooh ah the way u look at me im feeling u!! ah i just cant help but trying 2 keep it coo-oo-ool!! i can feel it in the beat when u do those things 2 me dont let nothing stop u mooove ring the alarm the club is jumping now so get up!!!'

This is a cute movie with a good story and great dancing. I love the soundtrack too. Who didn't fall in love with Jenna and Channing back in the day?!

Step Up (three stars)Director Anne Fletcher Writers Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg Stars Jenna Dewan, Channing Tatum Certificate PG Running time 103 minutes Country USA Year 2006Nora is training to be a dancer at the fairly exclusive Maryland School of the Arts. Tyler is a rebel from the wrong side of the tracks doing community service at the school after getting caught breaking in and vandalising it for kicks. She is classically trained in ballet and contemporary dance. He can breakdance like there's no tomorrow and throw in body-popping and cool good looks (Tyler is played by ex-model Channing Tatum). She needs a dance partner and there's the usual storyline footsie of boy-gets-girl, breaks up with girl, aspires, is gonna dance, is not gonna dance, they make each other feel good in public together then kiss-kiss finale.This is the same formula used in every modern dance movie and Step Up has no surprises, but for an enjoyable slice of this type of cake it is no worse than average. It doesn't have the glossy editing/directing and punchy acting to make it stand out like a Fame, Dirty Dancing, or Flashdance, but it's fine on its own level, competent, and has some good dance sequences.From a dance point of view, classical ballet is very upright, geometrical, relatively emotionally unexpressive and danced in a precise manner. Breakdance, using different heights, opening and closing in fluid motion to express feeling, and working off the beat more like jazz, is a natural opposite. Mixing the two together gives an interesting and explosive combination. Nora finds that her dance routine is greatly enhanced by Tyler's style and gives him a crash course in ballet (which would be needed for posture and control).A good hip-hop soundtrack boosts these joining of opposites, adding violin to the funkier beats. A forgettable movie, but worth seeing by dance fans or teenagers after easy-viewing.

The storyline is interesting, but no very unique and not as attractive as it could be.
The acting is poor at times and not as emotional for a drama movie, as the story had everything for it but the young and raw actors could have made it so much better.

While several portions of this movie were textbook cliché, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. Usually I don't bother with mainstream, commercial movies that are so obviously and unabashedly manufactured to sell to a teenage audience, but I had seen Channing Tatum in She's the Man (another movie that I was hesitant to see, but didn't regret it afterward), and thought he was absolutely gorgeous! Step Up would not have been as good as it was without him. He made even some of the more awkward lines of the script sound original and I really enjoyed watching him bust a move. Several parts were genuinely amusing and heart-warming despite the well-worn story of a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who falls in love with the uptight rich dancer. Overall, it was pure fluffy entertainment, like Save the Last Dirty Dancing. Just don't go in expecting much or analyze it too deeply and you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

You could file Step Up under the romance/dance genre along with other films as Bring it On, Save the Last Dance, and Honey. The screenplays are perhaps the weakest thing about these films, but you still can find them enjoyable when the lead characters deliver charismatic performances and know how to dance. That is the case with Channing Tatum who plays a troubled young teen who lives with his foster parents and spends a lot of time in the streets. One night out with his friends he ends up vandalizing an arts school and gets caught. He is ordered to do 200 hours of community service as payment for the damages he caused.

Not good enough however to get me interested in the sequels.

My cousin heather wanted to go to this movie, so she took me with her. I thought the movie was going to suck, but it ended up...that it was one of the best movies i seen all year. I really recommend that you watch this movie. The movie was based on two people, both from their own worlds. The world of break dancing, and the world of ballet. Comes together and falls in love. When Tyler is ditching his friends for Nora, they got mad at him. But they grow closer when "skinny" gets shot by a gang. With the loss of skinny behind them both...they go on again...but he doesn't forget his friends. So again...from a guy who is not sensitive..i recommend step up.

You've seen it all  feel-good story of deprived, delinquent kid finding the meaning of life, dedicated effort culminating in an upbeat dance finale, rich-girl-poor-guy routine, and a whole bunch of familiar situations. But, if the dance and music are good, you'll tend to forget the improbable, unlikely, illogical, contrived story and plot. Given the lame script, top choreographer Anne Fletcher's first crack at directing didn't come off too badly, partly because of the wise use of very short scenes. As to the dance routines, with her credentials, you wouldn't expect anything less than good, and the movie does deliver in that department. The stimulating fusion of hip hop and ballet is well synchronized with fusion in the music. While the attention would obviously be on the showcase number that the protagonists are developing, I also like one particular scene at a gig, when the two sidekicks sing on stage while the two leads do their thing on the dance floor. This scene has the beauty of exciting spontaneity not seen elsewhere in the movie.

The movie has the cliché's all over it. It is a tried and true formula of a down and out urban kid meeting up with the privileged kid and each learning something from the other. There is awkwardness in the beginning and the story hurdles are conveniently resolved quickly. But, you know, this still is one fun movie.

In looking over the reviews of Step Up I saw comparisons to Flashdance, Save the Last Dance for Me, and a few others. The pithy review that Step Up got in my hometown free paper Art Voice remarked that the film had some nerve to advertise it had an original screenplay. Personally I like to think of it as Eminem meets Fame. The only thing missing was Debbie Allen doing the choreography.Lead Channing Tatum in this film is a kind of an Eminem light. He's a kid being raised in a foster home in Baltimore and he's been busted for breaking in and trashing the Maryland School of Arts. As punishment he gets to do janitorial service at that same school. Channing's got some moves though and he hooks up with a girl from the right side of the tracks, Jenna Dewan, who needs a rehearsal partner. If you've seen all the films mentioned above you've got a pretty good idea what follows. If the film is hardly original, it doesn't mean that it's bad. Both the leads have some real moves on the dance floor and as Tatum regrettably remarked, he found out that dancing can indeed be like rocket science.

Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the "drama" scenes more bearable. The leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.All in all, a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences, and this movie is MUCH MUCH MUCH better than "You Got Served" in terms of the plot and drama. Then again, that doesn't say much, does it? =P

In Baltimore, the troublemaker and street dancer Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) lives with his foster parents in an Afro-American lower class neighborhood. His best friends are Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny Carter (De'Shawn Washington) and they use to hang around together, going to parties and stealing cars. After being expelled of a party, the trio breaks in the Maryland School of Arts and commits vandalism, destroying the stage. Tyler is arrested and sentenced to 200 hours of community service in the school and Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) assigns him to help the janitor cleaning the place. One afternoon, the ballet dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) sees Tyler dancing in the parking area and when her partner Andrew (Tim Lacatena) has a strain and Tyler offers to help her in the choreography, she accepts the offer; they rehearsal and become close to each other while Tyler becomes friend of the students Miles Darby (Mario) and Lucy Avila (Drew Sidora). When Andrew returns, Tyler that is known for quitting everything he starts gives up dancing and leaves Nora alone. After an incident, Tyler has to decide to follow his dream or return to his life of rebel loser. "Step Up" was a wonderful and delightful surprise for me. The heartwarming romantic story shows a perfect chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, supported by a magnificent cast and awesome songs and choreographies of dance. There are also drama and tragedy, funny moments and I recalled Alan Parker's "Fame" and "Center Stage" with the students following their dreams in an art school. The characters are nice, the actors and actresses are excellent and I have really loved this movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Ela Dança, Eu Danço" ("She Dances, I Dance")

I am not a teenager but I love dance and dance music which is why I went to see this movie. I didn't expect it to be a really deep movie but I love to see dance like Take the Lead. Those who rated it bad must have been expecting either more or something different. This isn't Lord of the Rings or anything that requires analytic skills. It is a dance movie which has some plot to it. The actors aren't academy award winners but they're not bad either. The male start doesn't show a lot of emotion but guys like that (my son is that way too) don't show a lot of outward emotion. He shows compassion for his siblings and his friend. It was a typical story but it's a dance movie. They can't just put a bunch of dancing with no story line. That would be a musical or stage production, not a movie.

The storyline is interesting, but no very unique and not as attractive as it could be.
The acting is poor at times and not as emotional for a drama movie, as the story had everything for it but the young and raw actors could have made it so much better.

Tyler Gage is a white kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Helping his friends escape, Tyler is caught red handed smashing up a school of the arts and is sentenced to community service there. While doing janitorial work he sees the ballet students doing their routines and he himself is later observed by one of the students (Nora) doing his street moves with his friends. When Nora's partner goes out with an injury she turns to Tyler to help her, since he has basic skills. Both have their struggles with this working relationship but while Nora opens up Tyler to the possibilities through dance, he brings an unique urban feel to her routine – but as romance blossoms things become harder.I never bothered with this film when it came out but the rising star of Tatum made me step back and take a look at this. What I found was a film that struck me as being a mass produced product rather than being a film that someone created or that the makers really wanted to make. What I mean is that didn't seem to be much in the way of passion or inspiration behind it. The story is a predictable mishmash of other films and you can see so many things from Breakin' through to Save the Last Dance all in the mix here. It is definitely something that knows what it needs to do, does it and doesn't worry too much about making it special, different or anything like that. And so it treads the path you know it will from the first minute and as a story it never rings true so much as just meeting it with a shrug.In fairness though the dance routines are reasonably good and the soundtrack does give it an energy that helps it but both of these things are the type of things that will fade with time as other films supersede it. The cast do the basics as well. Tatum is good in so much as he manages to carry off a white urban caricature without looking ridiculous. In the normal terms he is not "good" but on these terms he does the job. Dewan is attractive but you never feel the heat between them and their relationship (working or romantic) never seems real. The rest of the cast are pretty much doing what one expects as well – and when even Six Feet Under's Griffiths or The Wire's Lovejoy is calling it in, it hardly seems fair to expect Mario to be doing much.Overall this is a product more than it is a film and as such it is one of those things that does what the packaging says it does but doesn't innovate, doesn't excite and doesn't appear to have had much creative input into it apart from the final packaging. It is a solid genre film for the viewers it was made for but it is unlikely to stand the test of time well at all or indeed have much appeal to those that want it to do more than tick boxes.

The story of Step Up is simple and predictable. I just like one particular scene when the leading actor and actress dance over the harbor. Their dancing with the beautiful sunset and the sultry music, is truly impressive. If you like this movie, you may like Center Stage: Turn it Up too. There are resemblances between them. Overall, they are the kind of movies that are good to see when you're bored on a lazy day.

Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is a foster kid who is stealing cars with his boys. One night, he breaks into an arts school and causes some vandalism. He gets caught and is sentenced to 200 hours of community service at the arts school. Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) runs the school. Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) loses his dance partner with a sprain ankle and she pairs up with Tyler to practice for her big dance.The story is cheesy and simplistic but it has some hokey charm to it. The acting is all about Channing Tatum. He's got the arrogant charm of the lead character. Jeanna Dewan has a bit of vulnerability but not quite as compelling. For a dance movie, it has just enough goodness to embrace.

Step Up is more than just a fun movie, it's a real movement! It's right at the heart of the dance revolution flicks premiering towards the turn of the new millennium with Honey (2003) starring Jessica Alba of course then You Got Served (2004) cranked it up a notch then this in 2006 and Stomp the Yard (2007) shook things up the next year and you can even credit Center Stage (2000) way back in the day for starting it all!Step Up plays like a mixtape of some of your favorite hip-hop jams of the 2000s with Petey Pablo, T.I. and Ciara all contributing along the way and a great title track while R&B singers Mario and Drew Sidora actually show up to the party and kill it giving great performances!Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan interlude all of the cool, hot dance action with an inspiring and powerful true life love story that you just don't usually see play out onscreen as the main attraction. Dewan and Tatum fell in love in Step Up and that's definitely what makes this movie so special. They share genuine chemistry and they're so gorgeous together you can easily see why Tatum fell for her Jenna's amazingly beautiful and so sweet! Their love will last forever! Channing and Jenna split last year and they are no longer together, did you hear? I love Step Up! I love Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan too! I love dancing! And music!'ooh ah the way u look at me im feeling u!! ah i just cant help but trying 2 keep it coo-oo-ool!! i can feel it in the beat when u do those things 2 me dont let nothing stop u mooove ring the alarm the club is jumping now so get up!!!'

Music and choreography in 'Step Up' are one of the best in quality and in entertainment perspective. Not only the senior showcase piece at the ending, but choreography throughout the movie is also well coordinated such as 'Till the Dawn' in the club and 'Show Me the Money' in opening credits.What impresses me the most is that two genres come together to create synergy, so much better than when one stands alone. This perfect coexistence is not only in story but also in music and choreography. Rich girl and poor boy; classic and hip-hop; and ballet/jazz dance and street/freestyle dance. Great harmonization in music and choreography is significant because they resemble, symbolize, and signify the relationship between protagonists.I also want to compliment the chemistry between two actors while I also want to point out the story's resemblance with 'Save the Last Dance' and too many coincidences.

Choreographer and now director Anne Fletcher hits the mother lode with this gem of a dance flick! Having painfully seen similar dance-themed teen movies in the past (Take the Lead, Save the Last Dance, etc.), Step Up does justice to its genre by not pulling any stops in delivering a truly enjoyable movie. Hindi nagtipid sa pasikat.Unlike similar movies where the audience agonizingly waits through scene after scene of boredom for a grand dance finale (which usually fails to enthrall anyway), Step Up treats the audience to several impressive, memorable sequences thoughtfully scattered throughout the movie. Finally, we are entertained by a dance flick where the leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) are both beautiful to watch, have good chemistry (enough to sustain the kilig factor) and can really deliver the moves.Dewan is a superb dancer; she has a fabulously fit body, not the anorexic ballerina type, and she dons her outfits exceptionally well for someone who's only 5'3". It was also amazing to watch such a tall, gorgeous man like Tatum move the way he does (it must help that the boy knows his Kung Fu!). His deadpan facial expression makes his line deliveries unexpectedly funny. The supporting cast also amply sustains the rest of the story. Step Up churns out enough high points that you pardon its hiccuppy subplots and scene-stealing extras.

Although, it was stereotypical in some ways, it was a great movie especially if you love Art(s). I have certainly seen kids literally change from joining Arts & dance programs and when I watch this movie, I'm wondering why every city doesn't have one of these schools!!! Lots of talented people and it was kind of different from other dance movies (although I expected it to be the same) not a bad movie!! I think people in certain generations should rate movies that's targeted at them and not a lot of people who don't even understand!!

I wasn't really interested in seeing Step Up, but my friend just kept bugging and bugging me to see this film, especially since she is so in love with Channing Tatum, I tease her constantly about it saying how that's the only reason why she loved the movie. But she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing, that if I loved movies like Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead, and Save the Last Dance, that I should love Step Up, eh, what the heck? I guess every movie in some way has it's right to a view.Well, you know those movies I just mentioned up top? Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead, and Save the Last Dance? Well, put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that's what you have. Not to mention if you've seen those movies, well, frankly, you have seen Step Up. Because Channing is lower class with street smarts who just naturally feels the music while that snobby up class girl must follow step by step, how will they ever fall in love if they are so different? After all, this is their chance to "step up" to the passion, the mystery, and the lust of the dance! OK, that was a silly plot explanation, but like I said, as long as you've seen those movies I mentioned, or even if you just saw the plot, you get the movie. I don't understand how it actually has a 5.5 rating, I bet it's those Channing lovers! LOL! I'm kidding with you guys, but it's all good, I guess I just didn't get what others did with the passion, the mystery that is the dance! Oh, Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you?! 4/10

I thought this movie was really good. I'll admit the acting may not have been to it's full potential.. but I still thought it was pretty good. The movie is based on dancing and overall I thought the technique was very good. The talent displayed in this movie is extraordinary. The movie has romance, comedy, tragedy, and nearly everything else you would want in a good movie. The music in this movie is also really good. I would say this movie is well worth the money I spent. Step Up is inspirational and was everything I was expecting it to be. I'd highly recommend seeing it. If you enjoyed the movie Save The Last Dance this is probably a good movie for you. I found this movie to be very uplifting.

There was a time, soon after the second World War, when drive-ins numbered in the thousands and film distribution was evolving and a new "teen" market was creating a need for youth oriented product. This spawned a golden age of what came to be known as "B-movies", starring pretty young men and women, who were pretty talentless, full of fun and thin on plot. Step Up is a B-movie in every sense of the word.Today the movie business is extremely driven by teen dollars. This is why a film like Step Up is made. Perhaps the only reason. i can't imagine someone wanting to make this film for the message it conveys (community service can lead to new relationships?, white boyz can be ballerinas too?). Instead, this movie is exactly what it was designed for. Take a pretty boy who can dance, but really comes off tough (James Dean type) and a sweet young lady from a proper home, and let their worlds collide, then co-mingle. It's the Grease formula, all over again.Granted, Channing Tatum makes for a good John Travolta replacement, with some hood street cred, but looks that rival Brad Pitt's introduction in "Thelma and Louise". He actually comes across as an adequate dancer and actor, a nice cross between Eminem in "8 Mile" and Matt Damon in "Good Will Hunting". Unfortunately, his Sandra Dee isn't ready to make the leap to lead status, as Jenna Dewan's acting certainly needs more work than her dancing. The rest of the cast seems better suited for TV, including an oddly cast Rachel Griffiths (Brenda on "Six Feet Under") whose presence makes you wonder what she did to deserve this.The script is filled with every cliché under the sun, and just when you thought that something unpredictable might happen, it doesn't. Right from the beginning, when a character's younger brother is introduced, i said to myself, "Please don't make him be the lesson learned". Let's just say that every teen romance and ghetto flick plot line is rehashed to the exact detail, without a whiff of originality.What this allows the audience to do, is to enjoy the dancing scenes and the booming soundtrack. This may be the first film that would work better as a 90 minute music video, and save us from either uninspired dialogue, or misdelivered dialogue. Sadly, even the dancing doesn't compare to previous dance films like "Center Stage", "You Got Served", or "Honey".Grade: D+

Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. The scenery was good and the characters held true to life. It is worth the watch if you like that kind of film.
