... because the gags are so quickfire and chucked into the script with little thought as to whether they suit the plot (what plot?) or whether the characters would realistically say them.  No matter for me, because I was laughing all the way through, but I can appreciate why some people might not like that.   Like I said, don't go into this looking for a plot, because there isn't really anything other than the most basic premise to satisfy the distributors.  I personally found it refreshing that the movie asked no requirement of me other than that I be able to laugh.  This I did, loudly and frequently.   A final note on who I consider to be the main star of the show.  It ain't Carrey.  Jim, of course, does what we expect him to do.  However, it is Daniels - in an achingly funny turn - who surprises, and in doing so effortlessly steals the movie from under the nose of the rubberfaced loon standing beside him.  It may have something to do with the fact that Harry is (marginally) the more subtle of the two characters.

It's hard to believe this was out over a decade ago, but it was another in a long line (past few decades) of crude comedies....BUT one of the better ones regarding some laugh-out-loud funny scenes.The "classic" of the funny scenes, at least to most men including me, is poor Jeff Daniels on the toilet. No need to go into details! As crazy as Jim Carrey got in some of his earlier movies (Ace Ventura, Liar, Liar, etc) he's actually lower-key than in some of the other stupid-guy roles he played, one reason because he's doesn't shout in here. I didn't find the female lead in here, Lauren Holley, to be appealing but that's just my opinion.In modern-day slapstick, it means one basic thing: gross out your audience, so that's what is attempted here. When it works, it's very funny, such as that bathroom scene.. One thing for sure: the language makes this an R-rated film, not PG-13. Speaking of jokes, that PG-13 rating has become a joke.Anyway, you should get a lot of laughs out this: at least I suspect males will more than females....and that's all it was meant for - laughs, and nothing else - so don't trash the film because it wasn't "intelligent" enough for you.

In my opinion the greatest comedy ever made! Daniels and Carrey work magic together in this film that more than 20 years later is finally considered a classic. When it first came out it was labeled as complete garbage and toilet humour. But to those people I say it is the best garbage and toilet humour you could ask for. What do you expect to see when the title of the film is ''Dumb and Dumber''. The quick back and forth between the two lead actors and not so subtle chirping often goes unnoticed because your'e laughing so hard from the previous scene.the jokes and dialogue are so good and Carey and Daniels deliver them with such authenticity. It's because of this reason that I am able to watch this movie countless times and still be entertained, as I listen to funny remarks that I missed on the previous 100 viewings. What's truly great about this film is that even people who say they hate it will always without fail crack a laugh or two when re-watching it. They just don't want to admit that they find this nonsense to be funny...but it is. More than 20 years later and I still have not seen a buddy comedy that comes close to matching it.

Dumb and Dumber is a stupid movie, but what some people don't understand is that is what it is supposed to be! It's about two completely pathetic, dumb, and hopeless guys who do nothing but make complete fools of themselves. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels give the greatest comedic performances and form the best duo that has ever graced a screen. Every scene, every sentence they speak, and every body movement is pure genius. The way that each of them deliver their lines makes this movie an all time classic that will never get old. I never understood how someone could not like this movie. The only explanation I could have is they think they are too "intelligent" for a "dumb movie" like this. What they don't even understand that it's not the jokes or gags that make this movie so great, it is all in the performances. To those of you who do not like this movie please give it another try and watch Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the roles that they were meant to play.

The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, made their big break into filmmaking with this memorable vehicle for the talented Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Here, the Farrellys were able to establish a formula for their movies involving crude, absurdist humour and outlandish situations. Thought-provoking, intellectual entertainment is FAR from their goal, but Farrelly brothers movies like "Dumb and Dumber" work just fine in an undemanding way that doesn't tax anybody's brains. There are certainly some very notable bits and lines of dialogue throughout, plus two very enthusiastic performances by Carrey and Daniels.The two of them play Lloyd and Harry, two utter morons who can't hold on to jobs or go for long without screwing up. Then, one day, limo driver Lloyd drives the lovely Mary (Lauren Holly, Carrey's real-life girlfriend at the time) to the airport. She leaves behind a suitcase, and it becomes Lloyds' mission to return it to her and win her love. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the suitcase contains a fortune in ransom money, and the lowlife who was demanding the money is understandably NOT happy about what develops.There are a couple of capable actors & actresses in supporting roles - Mike Starr, Charles Rocket, Felton Perry, the comic Harland Williams (who tends to fare better when he's not the star of a movie), Victoria Rowell, etc. Veteran comic actress Teri Garr is utterly wasted playing Mary's stepmother, however. Making a very funny cameo as a redneck named Sea Bass is hockey player Cam Neely, and Lin Shaye, who became a repertory player in the Farrellys' next two pictures, appears briefly.At the least, you can say that a movie like this DOES live up to its title. And this viewer had a pleasant time revisiting it, and laughing at some of the ridiculous dialogue. "I got robbed by a sweet old lady on a motorized cart, and didn't even see it coming." Carrey and Daniels do share an excellent chemistry, and do appear to be having a great time; they're believable as best buds.Overall, good fun, beginning and ending in just the right way to demonstrate how clueless our protagonists are.Followed by an animated series, a prequel, and a sequel.Seven out of 10.

This is one of those films you can watch, and actually laugh at for a time or two, but after that, it's just not funny anymore.For a first viewing, this flick will deliver some genuine belly laughs, although you will feel your intelligence slip, as you enjoy it. Watch this one only for the chuckles. If you watch it for any other reason, you're watching the wrong movie.One of Carrey's better performances. His earlier works are far better, comedically, than are his later works. I like the genre change he seems to be experimenting with of late, and I hope it does something to rejuvenate the quality of his performances. Either way, this is quite entertaining, if only for a few run-throughs.It rates a 5.5/10 from...the Fiend :.

The Marx Brothers. Laurel and Hardy. Abbott and Costello. Jerry Lewis. Every generation has their dose of silliness. The 1990s had Jim Carrey. And along with him came the phenomenal hit "Dumb and Dumber," a simple tale of two numb skulls who journey to Aspen in search of a woman and happiness.Our tale begins when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson (the gorgeous Lauren Holly, who Carrey eventually married and then divorced) to an airport. He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine, and after he has dropped her off, he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport. Rushing inside, he grabs the briefcase, only to find someone closing the gate to her plane. "It's okay, I'm a limo driver!" he yells to a ticket checker, rushing down the airport jet way and running straight off of it, falling onto the cement runway below.After retreating to his apartment, he convinces his pal Harry (Jeff Daniels) to come with him to Aspen to return the briefcase to Mary. Harry, the smarter one (or is that dumb-less one?), at first hesitates, and then reluctantly agrees, and so they are off. Little do they know that the briefcase they carry is actually ransom money that Mary was trying to pay to get her husband returned to her. Now with hitment on their tail, Lloyd and Harry make it to Aspen only to wreak even more havoc.Comedic timing is everything in a comedy like this. Carrey and Daniels have chemistry and timing. Check out the scene where they are at the National Preservation Society Gala, and stand at a bar in bright, tasteless suits. The way they stand, talk, and interact is as if they really are bosom-buddies, two idiots without a clue.The film is directed by The Farrelly Brothers, Peter and Bobby. You may remember them as the men who brought us the hilarious "There's Something About Mary." But truth be told, "Dumb and Dumber" is even better than "Mary." Whereas "Mary" was a fun summer comedy with big laughs and tons of crude sex jokes, "Dumb and Dumber" is a true comedic gem, and carefully borders the line of tastelessness and taste, something "Mary" crosses over and never turns back to.Is this movie "dumb"? Yes, absolutely. Will it offend you? Perhaps if you're a snob. And I'm sure some film elitists will complain that there's nothing substantial or of artistic merit here.I don't think it matters. This movie is meant to entertain and it does so wonderfully. In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less, silly fare (such as "Me, Myself & Irene") - the difference here is that "Dumb and Dumber" manages to come across as both likable and entertaining, while still managing to feature characters we can actually, in some crazy way, find ourselves liking.In the end, this is just a very funny movie that is well-made and memorable - much more so than some of its other 1990s "stupid-comedy" counterparts.

"Dumb and Dumber" is a film that was fabulously successful. Although it cost $17,000,000, it ended up grossing $247,000,000!! Talk about a huge payoff for the Farrelly Brothers!The story is about Lloyd and Harold (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels)--two complete idiots who are roommates. When a passenger in Lloyd's limo leaves a briefcase behind, he vows to return it to her. There are two huge problems with this. First, this occurred in Rhode Island and she now is in Aspen! Second, although Lloyd thought she left it by accident, it was ransom money...and now he and Harold have it and mobsters are after them!Much of the humor was stupid--the sort of stuff middle school kids would love. However, I must admit that although much of the humor was awful, sometime is still made me laugh. Plus, the film ended well. So, I do recommend it BUT must point out that it is NOT for anyone wanting cleverness. Nope...crude humor, bad jokes and embarrassing moments...that's what you'll find and you, too, might laugh a bit like I did.By the way, for the love of God, do NOT watch the sequel "Dumb and Dumberer". None of the original writers, directors or actors are in it and it is a total bomb....and currently is on IMDB's notorious Bottom 100 list.

I realize I'm in the minority by not being a gushing fan of potty humor and a lot of scatological and very graphic sound effects, but DUMB AND DUMBER is definitely a movie that clicked with its targeted audience. And I can't ignore the fact that JIM CARREY and JEFF DANIELS have the ability to mug with the best of them, both showing lots of dexterity with comic material that they play to the hilt.But the film is a series of sight and sound gags more than a tightly constructed plot and it's just a matter of time before the Beavis and Butt-head type of guys driving cross country to return a valuable suitcase to its pretty owner (LAUREN HOLLY) would drive any normal person insane with their stupidity.The joke with the state trooper is probably the low point of all the tasteless humor, but here too, I'm sure I'm in the minority. Seems to be the highlight for others inclined to view potty humor as nothing more than harmless fun.If this sort of low comedy appeals to you, it's a funfest of crude jokes and imbecilic humor. It's either a comic masterpiece or a dud of titanic proportions, depending on your point of view.Carrey won a "Razzie" award as worst new star--although I don't agree with that designation at all. He's obviously a hyperactive, manic personality who can give Robin Williams a run for his money--and Daniels, too, is a talented chap. But I just wish they had a script more worthy of their peculiar talents.

This is the film that pretty much made the Farrelly brothers. They followed this up with Kingpin, There's Something About Mary etc. I can't stand Jim Carrey and can't understand why everyone else does! But in spite of that I can understand why this movie was a big hit. It's just so hilarious watching the dumb idiot friends (played by Carrey and Jeff Daniels) bumble their way from one idiotic situation to another. It's definitely not the most intellectual humour but it easily gets you laughing, poor taste or not. I would recommend watching this when you need a good, hard belly laugh and don't have anything better to do. Enjoy!

For all of you that say this movie is not funny, you must be crazy, this is the best comedy ever, with the best performances in the careers for daniels and jim carrey if you haven't seen this movie yet go out right now and movie i promise it wont dissapoint

I thought this was one of the funniest comedy movie of all time when it first came out. It's a bit outdated now and just not as funny as I remembered it. But it still works and the dumb elements didn't really get to the point where it's more annoying than it actually being funny. Jim Carrey gags are getting old now, but I could tell why it was such a hit back in the 90's. This has got to be one of the best duo to be in a comedy flick. If you like immature and yet at least somewhat amusing comedy, this one is most definitely worth a watch. While watching this for the 3rd time after a long period of not seeing it. I got a few chuckles out of it, but didn't find it all that funny. But I give credit for the comedic value when it first came out. I mean that laxative joke has been used over and over again after this movie. I am not sure if they are the pioneers of that joke, but they sure made it a hit in comedy flick to come afterwards. This is most definitely one of the movies that kick started Jim Carrey's career.7.2/10

From beginning to end, Dumb & Dumber is sheer hilarity. There is not a slow moment in the adventures of Harry and LLoyd, two great but incredibly unintelligent friends who decide to move to Aspen, Colorado to get out of their dead-end lives in Providence, Rhode Island. Jim Carrey delivers a side-splitting performance as Lloyd, the lovestruck limo driver who first suggested the trip to Aspen ("We got no food, we got no jobs, our pets HEADS ARE FALLIN' OFF!!"), mostly so that he can find Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), the woman he fell in love with after he drove her to the airport in Providence.Lloyd's and Harry's adventures on their trip are absolutely hilarious to watch, especially their run-ins with the criminals who are chasing them, trying to get the briefcase that Harry and Lloyd do not know is full of ransom cash. One of the best things about this film is that it never strays too far from reality. There is never anything presented that could not possibly happen in real life. Also, the original and strikingly funny comedy that was written for the film is great! I can't remember ever laughing this hard at a movie.Dumb & Dumber takes a good story, adds some tear-inducing comedy, some endlessly hilarious dialogue ("I guess they're right, old people, though slow and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose. Don't you go dyin' on me!"), and needlessly good direction and molds one of the funniest films ever. Good for all ages, Dumb & Dumber is sheer unadulterated comedy and is destined to become a classic.

For a comedy movie to still hold up 30 years later, that is pretty impressive. In the comedy space, I would consider this a must watch. While some of the jokes may have been dated there were multiple times where I laughed out loud and even one time I spit out my drink. This movie catches you off guard multiple times, and the humor is definitely that "dumb" or slapstick type of humor. If you enjoy that type of humor, you will definitely enjoy this movie. This movie definitely does enough for you to want to watch the second one, and I look forward to doing so. I have a hard time giving comedy movies in general above 7 so I feel comfortable with that rating. It's a good movie that you should watch.

Saw it a hundred times, and from crying in laughter to making your stomach hurt from laughing so hard, it is one of the funniest movies of all time. Caught it again recently for the over one hundredth time and tried to view it as an older skeptic, and I laughed even harder at scenes that originally were not as funny as the funniest ones. It's just an infallible, brilliant comedy that pushes the envelope just enough without going too far like some recent imitator movies of it have done.It's just nonstop laughs, incredible editing and pacing to never stop being funny, and once you think you've seen the funniest scenes, it just keeps getting funnier and delivering all the way up to the end and epilogue. This is imo easily the funniest movie ever made, and nothing really comes close to it. It's hard to believe, but it actually has a good, coherent backstory plot too, which also allows the supporting cast to shine in their minor comedy roles as well while making the story actually make sense. It never gets old.9/10

I never thought this was one of the funniest comedies ever, but I found the movie a lot funnier when I was a kid. The Farrelly Brothers are talented writer/directors who have made several funny flicks like "Kingpin," "There's Something About Mary" and "Stuck on You." Though "Dumb and Dumber" is probably second to "Mary" as far as popularity goes, I think it's one of their lesser flicks. The Farrellys are partially to blame, but I place most of the blame on Jim Carrey. Whoever decided this moron should be paid $25 million a movie should be shot in the head. Jeff Daniels, though less experienced in comedy, gives a much performance in my opinion. Unlike Carrey, he doesn't use the over-the-top, anything-for-a-laugh approach. Instead, he's more concerned with being true to the character. Why does Carrey have to do some goofy eye movement or vocal intonation with every line of dialogue he utters? I always say that the rule of comedy is to act normal in ridiculous situations. In Carrey's case, he prefers to act ridiculous in ridiculous situations. How anyone over the age of 10 can laugh uproariously at a fool like him is beyond me. The film contains its share of funny gags (like the famous toilet scene), but most of them are disgusting or stupid or a mixture of both. One of the most annoying scenes is one where Carrey and Daniels both eat these hot chili peppers. Their mouths start burning, so they squirt ketchup and mustard all over the place, trying to get some into their mouths. And of course, there are other gag-inducing moments, like a man hocking a loogie into someone's burger. I suggest that if you're over the age of 10 and not a sucker for Carrey's incessant mugging, you stay away from this flick. It's simply another overrated comedy.

When this first came out in 1994, wild horses couldn't drag me to the theater to see it. Why? Preconceived notions. Thank goodness for Cable TV, or I never would have seen this film. I like it, it makes me laugh.This is not a masterpiece. This is not an academy award winning film, not a film of strategic plots, this is as sophomoric as it gets  -- and that's fine with me. Sometimes, ya gotta escape. This'll do it.The title says it all. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are perfect for their roles, every time I watch this film uncut, I am laughing. I was always thinking, "How dumb can you get?" And in the next frame it gets dumber.This is one of those films you just have fun with. Either you like this kind of humor or you don't. But the world is in such turmoil, this is a welcomed, stupid, silly, break that hits just the right spot. I find it "stupid-funny" beyond belief.

... because the gags are so quickfire and chucked into the script with little thought as to whether they suit the plot (what plot?) or whether the characters would realistically say them.  No matter for me, because I was laughing all the way through, but I can appreciate why some people might not like that.   Like I said, don't go into this looking for a plot, because there isn't really anything other than the most basic premise to satisfy the distributors.  I personally found it refreshing that the movie asked no requirement of me other than that I be able to laugh.  This I did, loudly and frequently.   A final note on who I consider to be the main star of the show.  It ain't Carrey.  Jim, of course, does what we expect him to do.  However, it is Daniels - in an achingly funny turn - who surprises, and in doing so effortlessly steals the movie from under the nose of the rubberfaced loon standing beside him.  It may have something to do with the fact that Harry is (marginally) the more subtle of the two characters.

It's hard to believe this was out over a decade ago, but it was another in a long line (past few decades) of crude comedies....BUT one of the better ones regarding some laugh-out-loud funny scenes.The "classic" of the funny scenes, at least to most men including me, is poor Jeff Daniels on the toilet. No need to go into details!

Dumb and Dumber is a stupid movie, but what some people don't understand is that is what it is supposed to be! It's about two completely pathetic, dumb, and hopeless guys who do nothing but make complete fools of themselves. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels give the greatest comedic performances and form the best duo that has ever graced a screen. Every scene, every sentence they speak, and every body movement is pure genius. The way that each of them deliver their lines makes this movie an all time classic that will never get old. I never understood how someone could not like this movie. The only explanation I could have is they think they are too "intelligent" for a "dumb movie" like this. What they don't even understand that it's not the jokes or gags that make this movie so great, it is all in the performances. To those of you who do not like this movie please give it another try and watch Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the roles that they were meant to play.

They might be dumb, but they sure are funny. I think what really makes the movie come to life, besides the superb acting performance of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, is that the jokes feel genuine and innocent instead of overdone and forced. In one way or another it is easy to relate to some of what the poor guys go through. As the movie goes on it gets better and better. Overall great performance and funny jokes.

This movie goes from joke to joke constantly and never misses a beat. I could not stop laughing the first time I saw it, and the tenth time I saw it, and the hundredth time I saw it. This movie never gets old. There is not one single dull moment. The movie takes off and never lets up, not even enough to let you breathe. There is something absolutely mesmerizing and hilarious about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels' performances as the lovable idiots Lloyd Christmas( Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels).The movie starts out in Providence, Rhode Island with two guys who are down on their luck. They've just lost their jobs, are late on the gas bill(again), and make the best of a bad situation by returning a briefcase they've recovered to its rightful owner, an attractive woman named Mary (Lauren Holly). And Lloyd(Carrey), has fallen madly in love with Mary after driving her to the airport. It just so happens that Mary lives all the way across the country, in Aspen, Colorado (or is it California?) Sure its crazy and stupid, but they've got nothing to lose, so they take off in their 84' sheepdog. And let's face it, if we were them, we'd go too.Dumb and Dumber was not pretentious, the actors never made you feel like they were in on the joke. No, they played it with a straight face the whole way through, and that's really the best way to do comedy. Even when they aren't speaking, their body language alone is enough to elicit huge laughs. The reactions and facial expressions are perfect.The film wasn't warmly received by a lot of critics, but only because they couldn't lower their snouts long enough to realize that this was not another movie about dumb guys, but really a film about earnest guys. And they are pathetically funny just being themselves. They play stupid games in the car to pass the time, and sing aloud to keep from getting bored, and have crazy dreams of one day opening up a worm store.The movie plays out with a high spirit and feel good attitude that can't be matched. And the soundtrack is perfect; it really sets the tone and never feels out of place.Really, truly, without a doubt, the best comedy ever made. I will treasure this movie forever, and even when I watch it the 101st time, I know it'll make me laugh... and laugh... and laugh till it hurts.The film is well paced and has a spontaneous nature that lacks in most comedies. Behind all the stupidness, there is a real glow of brilliance. The fact is, more than all the goofiness and crazy antics, "Dumb and Dumber" is a film full of smarts, and that's what we end up admiring the most.

The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, made their big break into filmmaking with this memorable vehicle for the talented Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Here, the Farrellys were able to establish a formula for their movies involving crude, absurdist humour and outlandish situations. Thought-provoking, intellectual entertainment is FAR from their goal, but Farrelly brothers movies like "Dumb and Dumber" work just fine in an undemanding way that doesn't tax anybody's brains. There are certainly some very notable bits and lines of dialogue throughout, plus two very enthusiastic performances by Carrey and Daniels.The two of them play Lloyd and Harry, two utter morons who can't hold on to jobs or go for long without screwing up. Then, one day, limo driver Lloyd drives the lovely Mary (Lauren Holly, Carrey's real-life girlfriend at the time) to the airport. She leaves behind a suitcase, and it becomes Lloyds' mission to return it to her and win her love. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the suitcase contains a fortune in ransom money, and the lowlife who was demanding the money is understandably NOT happy about what develops.There are a couple of capable actors & actresses in supporting roles - Mike Starr, Charles Rocket, Felton Perry, the comic Harland Williams (who tends to fare better when he's not the star of a movie), Victoria Rowell, etc. Veteran comic actress Teri Garr is utterly wasted playing Mary's stepmother, however. Making a very funny cameo as a redneck named Sea Bass is hockey player Cam Neely, and Lin Shaye, who became a repertory player in the Farrellys' next two pictures, appears briefly.At the least, you can say that a movie like this DOES live up to its title. And this viewer had a pleasant time revisiting it, and laughing at some of the ridiculous dialogue. "I got robbed by a sweet old lady on a motorized cart, and didn't even see it coming." Carrey and Daniels do share an excellent chemistry, and do appear to be having a great time; they're believable as best buds.Overall, good fun, beginning and ending in just the right way to demonstrate how clueless our protagonists are.Followed by an animated series, a prequel, and a sequel.Seven out of 10.

Best film ever... why;Lloyd; That's a lovely accent you have. New Jersey? Lady at bus stop; Austria. Lloyd; Austria! Well, then. G'day mate! Let's put another shrimp on the barbie! Harry; Yeah I called her up, she gave me a bunch of crap about me not listening to her, or something, I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. Harry; According to the map we've only gone 4 inches. Mary; So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45? Harry; Well I got a few things to take care of. So how about we make it quarter to 8? Mary; Stop it Harry: Okay. 7:45 Need I say more... this film has it all comedy comedy comedy... that is all you need. I have heard people say that this film is just stupid, well they are right it is about 2 stupid guys doing a stupid thing in a stupid way and you just love them to bits for it... Okay it was not Forest Gump in the way Tom Hanks played the slow guy come good with what I would say was one of the best performances by any actor of all time but it was very funny. I almost swallowed my tongue, spat out my drink twice almost peed myself and watched it so many times I know the script even now 10 years on I still laugh it my friends eternal Harry and Lloyd...

This is one of those films you can watch, and actually laugh at for a time or two, but after that, it's just not funny anymore.For a first viewing, this flick will deliver some genuine belly laughs, although you will feel your intelligence slip, as you enjoy it. Watch this one only for the chuckles. If you watch it for any other reason, you're watching the wrong movie.One of Carrey's better performances. His earlier works are far better, comedically, than are his later works. I like the genre change he seems to be experimenting with of late, and I hope it does something to rejuvenate the quality of his performances. Either way, this is quite entertaining, if only for a few run-throughs.It rates a 5.5/10 from...the Fiend :.

The Marx Brothers. Laurel and Hardy. Abbott and Costello. Jerry Lewis. Every generation has their dose of silliness. The 1990s had Jim Carrey. And along with him came the phenomenal hit "Dumb and Dumber," a simple tale of two numb skulls who journey to Aspen in search of a woman and happiness.Our tale begins when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson (the gorgeous Lauren Holly, who Carrey eventually married and then divorced) to an airport. He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine, and after he has dropped her off, he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport. Rushing inside, he grabs the briefcase, only to find someone closing the gate to her plane. "It's okay, I'm a limo driver!" he yells to a ticket checker, rushing down the airport jet way and running straight off of it, falling onto the cement runway below.After retreating to his apartment, he convinces his pal Harry (Jeff Daniels) to come with him to Aspen to return the briefcase to Mary. Harry, the smarter one (or is that dumb-less one?), at first hesitates, and then reluctantly agrees, and so they are off. Little do they know that the briefcase they carry is actually ransom money that Mary was trying to pay to get her husband returned to her. Now with hitment on their tail, Lloyd and Harry make it to Aspen only to wreak even more havoc.Comedic timing is everything in a comedy like this. Carrey and Daniels have chemistry and timing. Check out the scene where they are at the National Preservation Society Gala, and stand at a bar in bright, tasteless suits. The way they stand, talk, and interact is as if they really are bosom-buddies, two idiots without a clue.The film is directed by The Farrelly Brothers, Peter and Bobby. You may remember them as the men who brought us the hilarious "There's Something About Mary." But truth be told, "Dumb and Dumber" is even better than "Mary." Whereas "Mary" was a fun summer comedy with big laughs and tons of crude sex jokes, "Dumb and Dumber" is a true comedic gem, and carefully borders the line of tastelessness and taste, something "Mary" crosses over and never turns back to.Is this movie "dumb"? Yes, absolutely. Will it offend you? Perhaps if you're a snob. And I'm sure some film elitists will complain that there's nothing substantial or of artistic merit here.I don't think it matters. This movie is meant to entertain and it does so wonderfully. In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less, silly fare (such as "Me, Myself & Irene") - the difference here is that "Dumb and Dumber" manages to come across as both likable and entertaining, while still managing to feature characters we can actually, in some crazy way, find ourselves liking.In the end, this is just a very funny movie that is well-made and memorable - much more so than some of its other 1990s "stupid-comedy" counterparts.

"Dumb and Dumber" is a film that was fabulously successful. Although it cost $17,000,000, it ended up grossing $247,000,000!! Talk about a huge payoff for the Farrelly Brothers!The story is about Lloyd and Harold (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels)--two complete idiots who are roommates. When a passenger in Lloyd's limo leaves a briefcase behind, he vows to return it to her. There are two huge problems with this. First, this occurred in Rhode Island and she now is in Aspen! Second, although Lloyd thought she left it by accident, it was ransom money...and now he and Harold have it and mobsters are after them!Much of the humor was stupid--the sort of stuff middle school kids would love. However, I must admit that although much of the humor was awful, sometime is still made me laugh. Plus, the film ended well. So, I do recommend it BUT must point out that it is NOT for anyone wanting cleverness. Nope...crude humor, bad jokes and embarrassing moments...that's what you'll find and you, too, might laugh a bit like I did.By the way, for the love of God, do NOT watch the sequel "Dumb and Dumberer". None of the original writers, directors or actors are in it and it is a total bomb....and currently is on IMDB's notorious Bottom 100 list.

I realize I'm in the minority by not being a gushing fan of potty humor and a lot of scatological and very graphic sound effects, but DUMB AND DUMBER is definitely a movie that clicked with its targeted audience. And I can't ignore the fact that JIM CARREY and JEFF DANIELS have the ability to mug with the best of them, both showing lots of dexterity with comic material that they play to the hilt.But the film is a series of sight and sound gags more than a tightly constructed plot and it's just a matter of time before the Beavis and Butt-head type of guys driving cross country to return a valuable suitcase to its pretty owner (LAUREN HOLLY) would drive any normal person insane with their stupidity.The joke with the state trooper is probably the low point of all the tasteless humor, but here too, I'm sure I'm in the minority. Seems to be the highlight for others inclined to view potty humor as nothing more than harmless fun.If this sort of low comedy appeals to you, it's a funfest of crude jokes and imbecilic humor. It's either a comic masterpiece or a dud of titanic proportions, depending on your point of view.Carrey won a "Razzie" award as worst new star--although I don't agree with that designation at all. He's obviously a hyperactive, manic personality who can give Robin Williams a run for his money--and Daniels, too, is a talented chap. But I just wish they had a script more worthy of their peculiar talents.

Dumb and Dumber is so stupid, it's brilliant....The dumb humor and wonderful acting from Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are so  well layed-out, and so well told, that this rates up as good tasteless comedy.  This movie is not for everyone though, a silly mood, and a taste for bathroom humor is required to sit through this, but if you qualify you're in for a major treat.  ****

This is the film that pretty much made the Farrelly brothers. They followed this up with Kingpin, There's Something About Mary etc. I can't stand Jim Carrey and can't understand why everyone else does! But in spite of that I can understand why this movie was a big hit. It's just so hilarious watching the dumb idiot friends (played by Carrey and Jeff Daniels) bumble their way from one idiotic situation to another. It's definitely not the most intellectual humour but it easily gets you laughing, poor taste or not. I would recommend watching this when you need a good, hard belly laugh and don't have anything better to do. Enjoy!

For all of you that say this movie is not funny, you must be crazy, this is the best comedy ever, with the best performances in the careers for daniels and jim carrey if you haven't seen this movie yet go out right now and movie i promise it wont dissapoint

I thought this was one of the funniest comedy movie of all time when it first came out. It's a bit outdated now and just not as funny as I remembered it. But it still works and the dumb elements didn't really get to the point where it's more annoying than it actually being funny. Jim Carrey gags are getting old now, but I could tell why it was such a hit back in the 90's. This has got to be one of the best duo to be in a comedy flick. If you like immature and yet at least somewhat amusing comedy, this one is most definitely worth a watch. While watching this for the 3rd time after a long period of not seeing it. I got a few chuckles out of it, but didn't find it all that funny. But I give credit for the comedic value when it first came out. I mean that laxative joke has been used over and over again after this movie. I am not sure if they are the pioneers of that joke, but they sure made it a hit in comedy flick to come afterwards. This is most definitely one of the movies that kick started Jim Carrey's career.7.2/10

From beginning to end, Dumb & Dumber is sheer hilarity. There is not a slow moment in the adventures of Harry and LLoyd, two great but incredibly unintelligent friends who decide to move to Aspen, Colorado to get out of their dead-end lives in Providence, Rhode Island. Jim Carrey delivers a side-splitting performance as Lloyd, the lovestruck limo driver who first suggested the trip to Aspen ("We got no food, we got no jobs, our pets HEADS ARE FALLIN' OFF!!"), mostly so that he can find Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), the woman he fell in love with after he drove her to the airport in Providence.Lloyd's and Harry's adventures on their trip are absolutely hilarious to watch, especially their run-ins with the criminals who are chasing them, trying to get the briefcase that Harry and Lloyd do not know is full of ransom cash. One of the best things about this film is that it never strays too far from reality. There is never anything presented that could not possibly happen in real life. Also, the original and strikingly funny comedy that was written for the film is great! I can't remember ever laughing this hard at a movie.Dumb & Dumber takes a good story, adds some tear-inducing comedy, some endlessly hilarious dialogue ("I guess they're right, old people, though slow and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose. Don't you go dyin' on me!"), and needlessly good direction and molds one of the funniest films ever. Good for all ages, Dumb & Dumber is sheer unadulterated comedy and is destined to become a classic.

For a comedy movie to still hold up 30 years later, that is pretty impressive. In the comedy space, I would consider this a must watch. While some of the jokes may have been dated there were multiple times where I laughed out loud and even one time I spit out my drink. This movie catches you off guard multiple times, and the humor is definitely that "dumb" or slapstick type of humor. If you enjoy that type of humor, you will definitely enjoy this movie. This movie definitely does enough for you to want to watch the second one, and I look forward to doing so. I have a hard time giving comedy movies in general above 7 so I feel comfortable with that rating. It's a good movie that you should watch.

It's hard to find a Farrley's Brother which isn't funny, and this is even harder to classify as, 'not funny'...because it is the funniest!Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels team up as the not just odd, but strange, weird and mentally disabled couple. After losing both of their jobs on the same day, Lloyd (Carrey), who retrieved a bag which a woman he drove to the airport leaves in the terminal, encourages his friend Harry to come with him to Aspen where the girl flew to. They think that the gas company is after them since they didn't pay their bill, but is actually the kidnappers of Mary (Holly)'s husband, who were supposed to pick up the money where she left it in the airport terminal.From their start in Rhode Island, until they arrive in Aspen, the kidnappers follow Harry (Daniels)and Lloyd, along the road. The script is the most well-written comedy I think ever, because every thing that they do in the movie, leads to something new and funny that ends up happening to them later on.Their are more than a few funny scenes, and the dialogue is always right-on.I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Farrley Brothers' movies, or anyone who likes Jim Carrey. It's a hilarious comedy and the two stars were perfectly casted, especially Jim Carrey, of course.And now, an excerpt from the film, "Skies, huh?" "That's right." "They yers?" "Yup." "Both of them?"

Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, Lauren Holly, Mike Starr, Karen Duffy, Teri Garr and Charles Rocket star in this 1994 comedy. Lloyd Christmas (Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Daniels) are 2 inept pals who decide to travel cross country to return a lost briefcase to a woman, Mary Swanson (Holly) whom Lloyd falls for. They head To Aspen, Colorado and discover that there's money in the briefcase. They don't realize it's ransom money for Mary's husband's kidnappers, but spend it anyway and decide to pay back with IOUs. Garr (Mr. Mom) plays Mary's stepmother, Helen, the late, Rocket (Delirious) plays Nicolas, an old family friend who is behind Mary's husband's kidnapping, Starr (The Last Dragon) plays Mental and Duffy (Blank Check) plays Shay, 2 thugs who work for Nicholas. This is a good comedy and Jim and Jeff are great together. I recommend this.

Saw it a hundred times, and from crying in laughter to making your stomach hurt from laughing so hard, it is one of the funniest movies of all time. Caught it again recently for the over one hundredth time and tried to view it as an older skeptic, and I laughed even harder at scenes that originally were not as funny as the funniest ones. It's just an infallible, brilliant comedy that pushes the envelope just enough without going too far like some recent imitator movies of it have done.It's just nonstop laughs, incredible editing and pacing to never stop being funny, and once you think you've seen the funniest scenes, it just keeps getting funnier and delivering all the way up to the end and epilogue. This is imo easily the funniest movie ever made, and nothing really comes close to it. It's hard to believe, but it actually has a good, coherent backstory plot too, which also allows the supporting cast to shine in their minor comedy roles as well while making the story actually make sense. It never gets old.9/10

Dumb and Dumber is a 1994 buddy comedy that follows two not very bright friends who set off on a cross country trip to return a briefcase to a lady that one of them has a crush on.Written and directed by the Farrelly brothers, this is an absolutely silly movie that will make you continuously shake your head while making you laugh your butt off at the same time. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels star together as two of the most ridiculous characters ever created, in a story that is goofy, original, and fun. It's filled to the brim with hilarious moments and great comedy that will have you coming back again and again.This is a great film, and a must see for any comedy fan. If you haven't seen this before, I would highly recommend checking it out.

I never thought this was one of the funniest comedies ever, but I found the movie a lot funnier when I was a kid. The Farrelly Brothers are talented writer/directors who have made several funny flicks like "Kingpin," "There's Something About Mary" and "Stuck on You." Though "Dumb and Dumber" is probably second to "Mary" as far as popularity goes, I think it's one of their lesser flicks. The Farrellys are partially to blame, but I place most of the blame on Jim Carrey. Whoever decided this moron should be paid $25 million a movie should be shot in the head. Jeff Daniels, though less experienced in comedy, gives a much performance in my opinion. Unlike Carrey, he doesn't use the over-the-top, anything-for-a-laugh approach. Instead, he's more concerned with being true to the character. Why does Carrey have to do some goofy eye movement or vocal intonation with every line of dialogue he utters? I always say that the rule of comedy is to act normal in ridiculous situations. In Carrey's case, he prefers to act ridiculous in ridiculous situations. How anyone over the age of 10 can laugh uproariously at a fool like him is beyond me. The film contains its share of funny gags (like the famous toilet scene), but most of them are disgusting or stupid or a mixture of both. One of the most annoying scenes is one where Carrey and Daniels both eat these hot chili peppers. Their mouths start burning, so they squirt ketchup and mustard all over the place, trying to get some into their mouths. And of course, there are other gag-inducing moments, like a man hocking a loogie into someone's burger. I suggest that if you're over the age of 10 and not a sucker for Carrey's incessant mugging, you stay away from this flick. It's simply another overrated comedy.
