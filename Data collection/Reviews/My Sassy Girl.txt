First, let me say that I didn't know this was a remake of a Korean film, so this review will not be a comparison of the two movies, it just discusses the merits of this one.I wanted to like this movie, partly because I really like Jesse Bradford, but mostly because I really love offbeat romantic comedies, and this certainly qualifies as that. I did like this movie, but I didn't love it.I think it gets better in the second half, especially after you find out more about Jordan's character. Before you understand her, she's just a really annoying person, and I couldn't imagine what this kind and gentle young man could possibly see in her.I think this movie works, but it's pretty far along the continuum of offbeat. I wouldn't discourage people from seeing this, but if you've read this far, I'll make a pitch for some offbeat romances that I liked better: Maze (2000) with Rob Morrow and Laura Linney, Dedication (2007) with Billy Crudup and Mandy Moore (don't scoff, she was great in this), Elvis and Anabelle (2007) with Max Minghella and Blake Lively. Check out all 4 of these, if you like romance without the cookie-cutter Hollywood banalities.

First I have to say I haven't heard or seen the original version, so I'm not making any comparison to that one. "My Sassy Girl" tells a story of a lonely guy which meets an apparently crazy girl on the subway, and in a strange way they get to know each other. Both main characters are portrayed by two great actors, which makes the movie becomes more involving. One thing that called my attention is that I indeed laughed in many scenes, including the hockey one. That's incredible, given that I hardly laugh in a romantic comedy-- I usually find them dumb. Sadly, after the one hour mark it appeals to the old clichés we're tired of. This is why-- and only why-- I don't give it a higher rating. Good romantic comedy indeed.

Not seeing the original My Sassy Girl, a Korean film from 2001, I appreciated it more than I probably should've. Once in a while, on a weekday, I'll watch a romantic comedy for the hell of it. I'll usually wind up liking it, but sometimes I don't want to watch something very negative and I'll just turn on something uplifting and positive like this film. There isn't much really to hate on a film like this.Basically, you know the story. Guy meets girl, they fall in love, they break up, they get back together. Movie is over. This one decides to tweak the formula just a bit to try and stand out. Charlie Bellow (Bradford) is a high strung up and coming businessman who just wants one thing; to succeed. One day he is in a subway and finds a girl (Cuthbert), drunk out of her mind, who is about to get struck by a train. He pulls her intoxicated self to safety, and chemistry begins.He takes her back home to his friends apartment where they await her recovery. When she finally does, the relationship from the two is a bit rocky, but soon they become closer and closer. That is when both realize they are beginning to fall for each other. Of course the audience has known that since the beginning.Jesse Bradford was also the guy who played the misogynistic jerk in I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell a year later. It's fun seeing him actually fond of girls. Especially after he played such a simple minded character acting on impulse. It's nice to see him appreciate women. Elisha Cuthbert is also a gorgeous, and wonderful add to the film. Neither her or Bradford do anything wrong and their chemistry is believable.It's not hard to get me to like a romantic comedy. If the story is cute, the characters are believable, the dialog is realistic, and it doesn't seem forced it works for me. In the grand scheme My Sassy Girl doesn't stand out, but it's enough to keep you interested. Still, I will go ahead and assume the original is the one worth seeing.Starring: Jesse Bradford and Elisha Cuthbert. Directed by: Yann Samuell.

Yann Samuell's version of 'My Sassy Girl' is pretty much 95% a scene by scene copy of the beautiful Korean film. The hackneyed plot really lacks soul. It's not as bad as the trashy Indian version called 'Ugly Aur Pagli'. The friend character in this American version is annoying and one of the many Hollywood clichés including the Hollywood ending. The Americanized rewriting also makes the characters clichéd. For example the sequences of Charlie's and his friends discussion about relationships is something we have witnessed in numerous sitcoms and movies. No marks for creativity. Jesse Bradford tries to make the best of Charlie (despite the poor writing). Charlie comes across as whiny but remains tolerable because Bradford manages to make some of him likable. Elisha Cuthbert has never looked better but she fails to deliver in the comedic scenes. She's better during the more intense moments.I loved Jae-young Kwak's 'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' which is one of my favourite romantic movies. So I was curious about this remake more so because I liked Bradford in his other movies and Cuthbert is quite pretty. This movie is no match for the original but it's not absolutely terrible (like the Indian one). Watch Kwak's movie if you haven't seen it yet and then give this one a try if you really want to.

I must admit when I first heard they were making an American remake of My Sassy Girl my stomach kinda churned. I wasn't sure that Hollywood could recreate the amazing korean film from 2001. Now there's good news and bad news... let's start with the good.I like how they added a bit more playfulness to the movie giving it strange cut-scenes in between the main story. This added to the fun factor of the movie, but some may see it as just a simple waste of time. Using New York as the place setting for this film seemed typical but executed decently. And using one of the most recognizable cities in the world helped users become semi-comfortable. Both leading actors do a decent job, nothing too overly noticeable but decent.Now the bad news, though the actors did a decent acting job.. you could still tell they're acting. When an actor feels his role and becomes the character the more enjoyable a film can be. For example Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight, he did an amazing job. I wish the actors did the same, but to be honest it seemed to be stale at times. Overall the movie is 1/2 bad. As a stand alone rom/com it does a pretty decent job. But for the hardcore fans it's really obvious that this movie will just never be as good as the original. It's definitely worth watching once, that way you can develop your own idea on this film. They did an OK job trying to port the movie, a lot of things were lost in translation and unfortunately with that happening it simply makes the movie OK.

I saw this film a while ago now, but I didn't forget it. It simply is one of those films that not a lot of people know, not a lot of people like, but I am one of those people. It just has something magical inside. I will confess that I've never seen the Korean version, but I do like this one very much. The cast was brilliant, the story, the film itself was so artsy, if that's the right word. Just beautiful. Now, I will not go into the details, because I may not remember everything clearly, but I do remember the end and as we all know, the endings are the best part and this film had a brilliant one. http://citizen-cinephile.blogspot.co.uk/

For the record, I have not seen the original version of this film. Therefore, my opinion is not biased in comparison to such.It took me a while to get used to this story, as well as the characters. I have seen several movies with a similar character to Charlie - the geeky hopeless romantic who's nice guy routine gives off a total push- over vibe. Of course he has the 'bad influence' friend, who's view of women is more materialistic rather than spiritual (however, the character provides comic relief, no matter how grotesque the humor is...it's 2010, pornography isn't the same blasphemy it used to be thought as). Nevertheless, Charlie's live seemed pretty bland and straight-forward; it was a great setup for the main plot.The moment Jordan is introduced, I knew she was going to be the other main character in this movie. And I have to say, from that moment she began to tick me off. Her personality, drinking habits, and everything that came out of her mouth made me upset, as well as (unfortunately) reminding me of women that I've known who are similar.But that was just me exploring the movie skin deep. About halfway into it, I found myself laughing at Jordan's antics, as well as noticing how much good she was doing for Charlie. She was giving him something extraordinary, that he had never experienced in his life. Have you ever felt like the sky is the limit? Well, with Jordan, I'm sure this was how the character felt. And this is partly why he knew he loved her.The second half of the film brings some unexpected twists, as well as a more dramatic-based dialogue. For anyone who has experienced heartbreak, this will surely push some emotional buttons.The acting in this movie is underrated and overlooked. Especially the contributions of Elisha Cuthbert (Jordan), there is motivation and inner emotion behind every action and every word. I've never been pushed and pulled to such polar opposites by an actor or actress before.This isn't your stock, cliché romantic comedy flick. It provides plenty to ponder over afterward, especially it's great morals and beliefs pertaining to destiny. If you believe in such a phenomenon, you'll only benefit from queuing this up on your Netflix account and witnessing it's artistic perspective.

As the tagline for this 2008 romantic comedy aptly says, "She's Beautiful, Smart, Funny And Totally Crazy." Jordan (Elisha Cuthbert) is also a thoroughly unpleasant person for most of the film, treating Charlie, a Midwestern kid living in New York City, like dirt, and doing her very best to thoroughly and completely torpedo everything he has going on in his life. Things improve as the film goes on, and you feel more sympathetic towards Jordan. Cuthbert's chemistry with Jesse Bradford is pretty good. There were a few nice moments in this, and a few funny ones as well. The ending is nice...as they always are in movies like this. Elisha Cuthbert is very easy on the eye, and definitely makes 'My Sassy Girl' much more watchable.

Amazing how even after years proving you wrong you 'll still judge a movie by it's covers. I was expecting a full-on romantic flick with color but not so much story on any based reality. Hell that isn't the deal! The film is funny -not to the extreme- with lines that balance well with the story and the background. The Jordan-Charlie writing is so good that is hard to tell if Elisha is really fitted for the role or if you just like Jordan! During the middle it makes a little curve which in my opinion is due to the fact that the movie is too short in contrast too the story.It is probably a must see if you are on your 20's.It also a must see if you like Elisha Cuthbert. You gonna like her even more.One last thing that made me watch this movie is the fact that Yann Samuell(Jeux d'enfants(2003))directed it. He obviously has his ways with love stories.7/10

Watch the Korean version first. This version will just act as a spoiler. This is Hollywood just taking the short cut. Look at what is huge in other countries and ripping it off. I was fortunate enough to see the Korean version first, if I hadn't this would have lessened the impact.The acting was only OK. A lot of the emotion was zapped out of the story. In the Korean version the Sassy girl was played and presented better. You knew there was something intriguing about the girl. She seemed emotionally hurt. In this version she seemed more psychotic, She just seemed to attack.

I can't say I understand the "original versus remake" fight. Yes, it's a remake, so what? The original one may be better, but this doesn't make this one unwatchable! So, for all remake haters: how much people do you think would've heard of this movie in it's original version as long as we know it's a 2001 film and the publicity it had was really weak? The remake it's really good fun, it's a romantic comedy, love story, fairy tale, whatever you wanna name it, it's gooood !!!!I liked this movie because of the story, it's uncommon, it's unpredictable! Honestly, I'm tired of the classic comedy where boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy get's girl back or vice-versa. This one actually made me feel the story and believe the characters.Totally watchable. Totally underrated. Totally...excellent! Enjoy!

I usually do not like remakes of movies but this one wasn't half as bad as the ones I have seen in the past. I mean look how honest it was and remakes usually don't do that. I mean this remake really had me thinking how does one get over a great love. And yes her way was a little crazy but she also helped him in a way only it takes awhile to realize it.I think they tried to make it as honest as possible for Americans which I love. We like to censored our movies more than other countries but even so not that bad people. I know that us as Americans love movies we don't have to read, but sometimes reading subtitles is truly worth it. This movie was great but the first one was better because it was funnier and it had way more emotion. And I like how in the original the girl had no fear she did what she wanted when she wanted. Especially the train scene that they did not put in the remake. Maybe remake movies would be better if you make them exactly like the first one in our languages.But I love the fact they picked Elisha because she has that whole sweet innocent crazy girl going on like her movie the girl next door. She is really growing as an actress.

I haven't really watched the original from start to end, so I can't say for sure how well this version was vis-a-vis the Korean one, which shot Jeon Ji-Hyun to prominence in the starring role. The Hollywood remake however, went straight to DVD, but you know that it's Uniquely Singapore that we give DVD releases a chance on our big screens. That said, I thought this remake wasn't as bad as it was made out to be, what with some screaming blasphemy, and calling it inferior.Truth is, I was entertained from start to end, nevermind if certain scenes seemed implausible. After all, this is a romantic movie, and in the genre, if the man says he's gonna fetch a moon, he jolly well plucks it out from the night sky and delivers it. And if we're talking about implausible romance sequences here, then director Yann Samuell would be the right guy at the helm, after all, he brought us the French movie Love Me If You Dare.Elisha Cuthbert takes over the role immortalized by Jeon Ji-Hyun, as Jordan Roark (whose last name becomes a running joke) the ditzy, crazy and perpetually drunk lass whom Charlie Bellow (Jesse Bradford) falls for in one random night where he saves her from potentially injuring/killing herself at the subway. So begins the abusive person versus the Mr straight- laced all round nice guy in comic routine after comic routine, which for the most parts, weren't exactly funny to begin with. And their outings all stem from her dictating where and what time to meet, in which he dutifully obeys, not knowing what's in it for him.Maybe he's a wuss but I guess it stemmed from his being a romantic and genuinely wanting to do whatever she dictated, for the simple reason that he's smitten. After all, I guess who wouldn't, given her attractiveness, and the extremely strange circumstances, which do get explained, in which she behaves. But while both leads are good looking, they do lack a certain chemistry when with each other, making it look like a very forced meeting of lovebirds, in a very artificial way.That aside, the movie does have its slick ending to thank for in weaving together their respective back stories, though they do detract and distract from the main narrative, and bring some attention to how beautiful those shots were made, in having to integrate seamlessly one scene to the next. And its concept of Destiny, and dealing with it, on one hand felt completely honest with its building of bridges to each other, of having to know it and to work at it, but alas the movie eventually fell back on what it had preached, opting instead to leave it to the stars, and a very quick and coincidental one at that, which you can see coming from miles away.I guess for those who have not seen the original, we might be blown away by the story and revelation, given that Korean romantic movies/weepies do not come only at face value. However, having seen some Korean remakes, I would reckon that those who have seen the original will call this a travesty. The jury's still out however, until I get my hands on its Korean predecessor, and then I'll let you know what I think. That I believe I should be able to do so since this version has intrigued me to give the original another go.Otherwise, this movie's still adequate for a decent romantic date. I did however, feel sorry for actresses who played the 11 Woman of No Consequence - sheesh, what a title!

Charlie Bellows (Jesse Bradford) is from a small Indiana town, where his dad repairs machinery for a knock-off John Deere company. The Bellows save and save for Charlie's education, for their dearest wish is for him to become a top officer of the tractor company. When Charlie is accepted at an elite college in Manhattan, it seems dreams can come true. However, just as Charlie is settling in and keeping his eye on the prize, a woman totally diverts his path. Beautiful Jordan (Elisha Cuthbert) appears very drunk and lands on a subway track. Yes, indeed, Charlie rescues her. It soon becomes a pattern, as Jordan self proclaims that she is in a "reckless" phase. Yet, an unlikely friendship emerges, with offbeat dates like breaking into a seasonally closed amusement park and riding the ghost tunnel. Yet, Jordan never wants the relationship to go beyond palsies. In fact, there are secrets and, to Charlie's dismay, Jordan suggests the duo writes their wishes for each other in letters. The notes are to be cast into a time capsule and buried for a year in Central Park. When 365 days are past, then this gal and gent will meet again to discover what their future holds. In the meanwhile, Jordan's eccentric behavior may have nixed Charlie's chances of landing a top job with John Deere-like. What, what will happen? This movie turns out to be an adaption of a widely praised Korean film. This viewer didn't see the original but, most likely, some things don't translate well. While this a fairly well done romantic comedy with two nice leads in Bradford and Cuthbert, its not a four star winner. The script is very imaginative, with plenty of quirks while the sets, costumes, and direction are acceptable. With the romcom on Hollywood's endangered species' list, most fans of the genre will want grab this one while they can.

why why why? they have just destroyed the classic of the original Korean movie....MY SASSY GIRL. Please watch the original movie before u watch this movie, because they have mix the scene altogether.....plus some very poor acting by the cast...this movie should be named has not MY SASSY GIRL...also in this movie it does not explain the full story of the girl. like in the original movie... its stupid, boring and waste of time please please watch the original version of my sassy girl and now u can even watch the uncut version of the original movie...this movie...well u can burn it....because if u watch this movie you'll be wasting your time

As someone who's seen both movies, I can't say I am obliged to hate this one (nor I think anyone should). Matter of fact is, there is much to enjoy from this as well, specially photography and scenery, and if you come to me saying that its a knockout just because it takes place in NY, then by all means, please go and try enjoy life. So what its a remake, this was still very much enjoyable and a extremely well told story.If you have such strong feelings that just because there was an original one you have to hate on this one, then odds are you're missing tons of stuff in life.

It's easy to be cynical about Hollywood's efforts to remake Asian hits for an Amrican audience when the results are as poor as they are here. A lacklustre effort that fails to generate even a smidgen of the Korea original, 'My Sassy Girl' falls flat on almost every count.It's surprising, actually, given the talent involved. Yann Samuel, who directed the devilishy funny 'Love Me If You Dare', helms the picture, and it stars Jesse Bradford as well as the lovely Elisha Cuthbert. They're all good in their own rights, but somehow the chemistry never quite works.'Love Me If You Dare' had a similar premise, actually, and it's surprising that Samuel never quite finds the right tone here. Neither he nor his actors ever get into a comfortable rhythm.First Maq.

My sassy girl is a remake of the Korean movie of the same name. unfortunately it is not as good as the original Korean one and i just didn't like it very much. the original has better acting and this one doesn't outshine the original with it's acting. the girl in this movie doesn't play the part very well and the guy just doesn't do anything for me. if your going to use the (almost) exact same scenes you should at least do better than the one you are remaking.... if you want to see this movie i suggest watching the original with subtitles (which can be found on the internet) in my opinion it's better. feel free to disagree and compare them yourself. see which one you think is best. the original Korean one was made in 2001 and the American one was made in 2008 (to clear up any confusion). sorry if this offends but i fell this remake was a flop.

It is common for people to console someone who is suffering for love or for never having really experienced it by saying that when you least expect it, a great passion can arise. Those who cling to such thinking inevitably start to idealize the moment of this meeting with all the pomp of a Hollywood movie, being able to even imagine themselves experiencing somewhat cliché situations and dialogues. Fueled by these fantasies, thousands of people go about their lives until the big day arrives, however, when the love of their lives is finally near, it can go unnoticed due to circumstances that do not resemble their dreams at all. This is how the love of the protagonist couple of "My Sassy Girl" begins, which invests in subtle humor to win over the viewer, but in the final stretch resorts to melodrama.The film begins by introducing us to Charlie Bellow (Jesse Bradford), a young man who is alone in the middle of an autumnal landscape saying that to understand how he got there you need to know his story from the beginning. He grew up in a quiet town and his parents did everything to give him a good education so that he could enter a renowned university to study business and, who knows, follow in the same professional footsteps as his father. Raised in a traditionalist environment and with his future partially mapped out, there wasn't much for Bellow to worry about, but what about his personal life? He goes to live alone in New York dreaming of a better position in the job market, but unlike most singles he is not a flirtatious guy nor adept at casual sex, which sounds strange to many, like his friend Leo (Austin Basis) who tries to encourage the boy to have fun and be cooler. Once asked what kind of girl would make him lose his mind, Bellow randomly locks eyes with Jordan Roark (Elisha Cuthbert), a young woman who seems full of attitude and personality. She already says the popular saying that opposites attract, so she would be the perfect girl for a more peaceful and down to earth young man. This moment could be typical of cinema, but they don't exchange a single word, they don't even approach, but fate wanted the two to meet. Bellow finds the girl again at the subway station, screaming for someone and putting herself at risk near the tracks. After a bizarre fit of emotions, Jordan ends up taking her home. In the same way that she appeared in her life, the girl disappears the next day, but soon gets in touch asking, or rather demanding, a meeting with the one who extended her hand.Bellow then notices that the girl is witty, always has a retort or joke on the tip of her tongue, but deep down she seems a little out of place. Probably the joy she shows is the way she found to deal with some frustration. Other encounters take place and so they start dating naturally, the young man no longer caring about the many losses of job opportunities to be able to stay with his girlfriend whose favorite hobby is writing stories that he believes have the potential to become movie scripts. Interestingly, her texts always take place in future times, yet another proof that she does everything to escape reality. In a fun sequence starring the couple themselves, she even reinvents the plot of the movie Titanic in the year 2037 with the famous Jack and Rose again separated by the collision of the ship with an iceberg, after all she is sure that man never learns from his mistakes. All of Jordan's madness, between moments of joy and outbursts of anger or sadness, ends up infecting the boyfriend who ends up exceeding himself in the fun and necessarily meets her father, Dr. Roark (Chris Sarandon), a doctor who ends up attending to the boy after he falls and hits his head. He exchanges medicine and exams for advice: he wants to see him away from his daughter, as he considers him a bad influence that makes her lose her sense of boundaries.Until then we are left wondering what kind of novel is this? How can anyone fall in love with such a strange figure and such a fickle temper? Many may already be bored or confused, but romance fans may like the plot twists. There comes a moment when Bellow realizes that while Jordan does him good, she also seems inclined to destroy him, but even listing all her faults ends up coming to the conclusion that he is really in love with the crazy girl. Between encounters and disagreements, we will only know the real reason for the girl's behavior and her fixation on her current boyfriend when the narrative returns to the starting point, the park in which Bellow is at the foot of a tree with a peculiar image and of great importance to the couple. Such secrets are even more predictable when the girl's father looks for the possible son-in-law to apologize and assume that he treated him badly thinking he was just another one who took advantage of the weakness of his daughter who constantly returned home in the company of strangers for being drunk in an attempt to drown sorrows.One of the film's greatest strengths is the chemistry between the leads, Elisha Cuthbert and Jesse Bradford. Her performance is endearing and entertaining, bringing the dynamic between Charlie and Jordan to life in an enchanting way. Cuthbert delivers a compelling portrayal of Jordan, an enigmatic and unpredictable young woman who keeps the viewer intrigued with her unexpected actions. She conveys the complexity of the character, switching between moments of vulnerability and defiance with ease. On the other hand, Bradford portrays Charlie with sensitivity and vulnerability, giving the film a solid emotional foundation. Her performance is moving, capturing the genuine emotions of someone discovering love and facing the ups and downs of an unusual relationship."My Sassy Girl" features several memorable and emotional scenes that contribute to the development of the plot and the evolution of the characters. Below, I detail some of the main scenes of the film: The Meeting on the Train, where the first meeting between Charlie and Jordan takes place on the train. Jordan is visibly drunk and behaves erratically and unpredictably. She ends up falling asleep on Charlie's shoulder, who is both confused and delighted by the situation. This scene is the starting point for the unusual relationship between the two, as it marks the beginning of their emotional connection.The relationship between Charlie and Jordan is full of unusual and even crazy situations. In an iconic scene, Jordan dares Charlie to perform a series of awkward actions in public, such as awkwardly dancing in a subway station. The scene is funny and reveals Jordan's eccentric nature, as well as Charlie's willingness to accept her eccentricities. Another scene to stand out is Jordan's outburst, in which the girl in an emotionally powerful moment, Jordan finally reveals to Charlie the reason behind her unpredictable actions. She shares with him the painful story of her past and her emotional struggles. This scene is a crucial point in the development of their relationship, as it allows Charlie to better understand Jordan's complexity and help her face her own traumas. As the film nears its climax, Charlie is faced with a difficult decision that could determine the future of her relationship with Jordan. This scene is emotionally charged as Charlie faces his own insecurities and has to decide if he is willing to risk everything for true love. The film is a combination of funny, touching and emotional moments that reflect the complexity of human relationships and the transformative power of love.The direction of Yann Samuell is another positive point of the film. The director embraces the vibrant and chaotic energy of the characters, creating a happy and unpredictable atmosphere that reflects the nature of the relationship between Charlie and Jordan. He skillfully balances moments of humor and romance, creating an engaging experience for audiences. In addition, even with nothing really innovative and with some plans that are super conventional and even without visual appeal, Samuell's direction offers a sensitive view of the emotional journey of the characters, allowing the viewer to connect with their experiences in an authentic way. The film's plot is a fun and exciting exploration of how a relationship can transform people and make them open to new possibilities. The plot addresses themes such as personal growth, the importance of authenticity and acceptance of oneself and others. The relationship between Charlie and Jordan builds gradually, and each stage of that development is sensitively handled by the script. Moments of humor and romance are balanced, avoiding making the story too light or too dramatic. Instead, the film presents a genuine journey of self-discovery, building empathy and emotional connection with the characters.However, it is important to mention that the film can be overly sentimental and predictable at times. Some situations and plot twists can feel a bit forced, which can affect the film's emotional impact. Furthermore, while the central relationship is developed in an engaging way, some secondary characters are not given the same care and end up becoming stereotyped or underdeveloped. With a different third act, even if predictable and appealing, "My Sassy Girl" is a charming romantic comedy, which although it has some flaws, is a fun option for romantic comedy lovers looking for a captivating story about the transformative power of love and acceptance. The combination of the beautiful and charming Elisha Cuthbert and Jesse Bradford, Yann Samuell's sensitive direction and a genuine story of self-discovery make "My Sassy Girl" a pleasant and exciting cinematic experience, even if it does not deviate much from the formula of exemplars of the genre.

Im a big fan of the original Korean version. This Hollywood remake is a total failure.The screenplay is bad. The story is much less convincing than the original. In the original version, the girl was heartbroken, whose fiancé was killed in a tragic accident, and was really sassy. This made her character inner conflicted. On one side, she was a vulnerable, heartbroken girl. She was so beautiful, so sweet, so sad, like a princess lost her prince. On the other side, she was a furious, sassy, horrible lady. She was mad at the God, at life, and even at herself. According to the typical social standard she was not a decent girl. But sometimes， as i said, she is so sweet.In the meantime, her boy, the boy, was confused. He had no idea about the accident. The girl was just a sassy beautiful girl. Himself, was a lazy, yet naive boy. He took what the life gave him. Hardworking was not in his book. One day a beautiful girl came into his life. He didn't even know what was going on. He didn't even like the girl at first.In the days he was with the girl, he was silently changed by the girl. From a outsider to a hardworking, life-loving boy.The remake, however, gives us a geek who had a glorious future b4 he met the girl. In less than half an hour, they seems bonded so much because of no reason. and What happened next seems so fake. Too much acting but no true feelings.In order to avoid the spoilers, there are few details above about the remake one.The only reason to watch the remake is to know how remarkable the Korean version is and how trash this remake could be.

First, let me say that I didn't know this was a remake of a Korean film, so this review will not be a comparison of the two movies, it just discusses the merits of this one.I wanted to like this movie, partly because I really like Jesse Bradford, but mostly because I really love offbeat romantic comedies, and this certainly qualifies as that. I did like this movie, but I didn't love it.I think it gets better in the second half, especially after you find out more about Jordan's character. Before you understand her, she's just a really annoying person, and I couldn't imagine what this kind and gentle young man could possibly see in her.I think this movie works, but it's pretty far along the continuum of offbeat. I wouldn't discourage people from seeing this, but if you've read this far, I'll make a pitch for some offbeat romances that I liked better: Maze (2000) with Rob Morrow and Laura Linney, Dedication (2007) with Billy Crudup and Mandy Moore (don't scoff, she was great in this), Elvis and Anabelle (2007) with Max Minghella and Blake Lively. Check out all 4 of these, if you like romance without the cookie-cutter Hollywood banalities.

He pulls her intoxicated self to safety, and chemistry begins.He takes her back home to his friends apartment where they await her recovery. When she finally does, the relationship from the two is a bit rocky, but soon they become closer and closer. That is when both realize they are beginning to fall for each other. Of course the audience has known that since the beginning.Jesse Bradford was also the guy who played the misogynistic jerk in I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell a year later. It's fun seeing him actually fond of girls. Especially after he played such a simple minded character acting on impulse. It's nice to see him appreciate women. Elisha Cuthbert is also a gorgeous, and wonderful add to the film. Neither her or Bradford do anything wrong and their chemistry is believable.It's not hard to get me to like a romantic comedy. If the story is cute, the characters are believable, the dialog is realistic, and it doesn't seem forced it works for me. In the grand scheme My Sassy Girl doesn't stand out, but it's enough to keep you interested. Still, I will go ahead and assume the original is the one worth seeing.Starring: Jesse Bradford and Elisha Cuthbert. Directed by: Yann Samuell.

Yann Samuell's version of 'My Sassy Girl' is pretty much 95% a scene by scene copy of the beautiful Korean film. The hackneyed plot really lacks soul. It's not as bad as the trashy Indian version called 'Ugly Aur Pagli'. The friend character in this American version is annoying and one of the many Hollywood clichés including the Hollywood ending. The Americanized rewriting also makes the characters clichéd. For example the sequences of Charlie's and his friends discussion about relationships is something we have witnessed in numerous sitcoms and movies. No marks for creativity. Jesse Bradford tries to make the best of Charlie (despite the poor writing). Charlie comes across as whiny but remains tolerable because Bradford manages to make some of him likable. Elisha Cuthbert has never looked better but she fails to deliver in the comedic scenes. She's better during the more intense moments.I loved Jae-young Kwak's 'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' which is one of my favourite romantic movies. So I was curious about this remake more so because I liked Bradford in his other movies and Cuthbert is quite pretty. This movie is no match for the original but it's not absolutely terrible (like the Indian one). Watch Kwak's movie if you haven't seen it yet and then give this one a try if you really want to.

I must admit when I first heard they were making an American remake of My Sassy Girl my stomach kinda churned. I wasn't sure that Hollywood could recreate the amazing korean film from 2001. Now there's good news and bad news... let's start with the good.I like how they added a bit more playfulness to the movie giving it strange cut-scenes in between the main story. This added to the fun factor of the movie, but some may see it as just a simple waste of time. Using New York as the place setting for this film seemed typical but executed decently. And using one of the most recognizable cities in the world helped users become semi-comfortable. Both leading actors do a decent job, nothing too overly noticeable but decent.Now the bad news, though the actors did a decent acting job.. you could still tell they're acting. When an actor feels his role and becomes the character the more enjoyable a film can be. For example Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight, he did an amazing job. I wish the actors did the same, but to be honest it seemed to be stale at times. Overall the movie is 1/2 bad. As a stand alone rom/com it does a pretty decent job. But for the hardcore fans it's really obvious that this movie will just never be as good as the original. It's definitely worth watching once, that way you can develop your own idea on this film. They did an OK job trying to port the movie, a lot of things were lost in translation and unfortunately with that happening it simply makes the movie OK.

I saw this film a while ago now, but I didn't forget it. It simply is one of those films that not a lot of people know, not a lot of people like, but I am one of those people. It just has something magical inside. I will confess that I've never seen the Korean version, but I do like this one very much. The cast was brilliant, the story, the film itself was so artsy, if that's the right word. Just beautiful. Now, I will not go into the details, because I may not remember everything clearly, but I do remember the end and as we all know, the endings are the best part and this film had a brilliant one. http://citizen-cinephile.blogspot.co.uk/

(Spoilers) So, we have a film about a woman who can't let go of her first love, whom she obviously idealized. She subsequently struggles to accept a new suitor for what he is in his own terms. Instead, she wants him to magically become the old guy. It's more than ironic that so many of the critiques of this film do exactly that—fail to judge it on its own terms. So maybe your former lover really was superior, maybe Jordan's ex was better than Charlie, and, yes, maybe the original Korean version of this film was better than the American remake. I can accept that. But judge this film on its own terms, please. The way the plot unfolds – without my spoilers – allows the oddities of its characters to go unexplained until near the end. In retrospect I found Jordan's character and behavior quite plausible. Similarly, Charlie is a bit two-dimensional at first, but then what do you expect from French Lick, Indiana – an artsy guy like Larry Bird? The guy's ambition is to go into corporate agricultural, after all. There really are people like that. This mysterious girl lures him into something more alive, to use his term. She gains depth in retrospect, once we understand her, and he gains depth because of her. The plot is simply instinctive love exerting a force that carries two young lovers through well-placed doubts and formidable emotional perils. Not terribly original—perhaps even trite, but I liked it. Restrained as I once was by dull ideals, I strongly identified with Charlie's simultaneous resistance and compulsive attraction to this vector- deficient girl who takes over his life. Several times I told him to run fast and far. Yet, although I couldn't understand why, instinct told us to stay. Based on the alleged quality of the original film, this remake of My Sassy Girl probably could have been a masterpiece, but this film is just fine in its own right. I take issue with much of what Hollywood does, including falling short in remakes, bringing every film to a cliché ending, and grossly overstating the presumed wealth of most characters – none of my physician friends live in anything near the multi-floor Manhattan mansion that the doctor, maybe 15 years out of med school – inhabits. With all its flaws, however, My Sassy Girl pleasantly filled an evening and made me smile.

VERY SIMPLE.Nothing to say about this movie! Cannot be worse.Just one comment! Please watch the original version! You will see how much super awesome original version can become the worst movie.Just amazed by how really awesome movie can be worst one.All the people I know who have watched this movie was horrified.All the people I know who have watched the original movie was just amazed by it.PLZ TRUST ME.WAHTCH THE Original VERSION!!! You will appreciate my advice.

Even if the movie doesn't start that well, with the acting really unconvincing, it gathers quality in the second part. I think it is quite underrated, maybe 9/10 it's quite generous of me, but I must admit that the park scene is just beautiful. And the way that Elisha Cuthbert is dressed and how well she plays that scene made me more generous to a movie that, being objective, I would rate 7/10. It is a rare movie of Elisha in which she has a really strong role, and it's not a highschool movie, or a horror movie. I think this lady can bring so much more out of her talent. Also Jesse Bradford is not the best choice for this role, but nonetheless the storyline is well written. I must admit I didn't see the originalmovie, but still with the bad U.S.A style of romantic movie, I really liked it, and I would recommend it to anybody who is fascinated by the beautiful face of Elisha Cuthbert and who goes into this types of movies.

For the record, I have not seen the original version of this film. Therefore, my opinion is not biased in comparison to such.It took me a while to get used to this story, as well as the characters. I have seen several movies with a similar character to Charlie - the geeky hopeless romantic who's nice guy routine gives off a total push- over vibe. Of course he has the 'bad influence' friend, who's view of women is more materialistic rather than spiritual (however, the character provides comic relief, no matter how grotesque the humor is...it's 2010, pornography isn't the same blasphemy it used to be thought as). Nevertheless, Charlie's live seemed pretty bland and straight-forward; it was a great setup for the main plot.The moment Jordan is introduced, I knew she was going to be the other main character in this movie. And I have to say, from that moment she began to tick me off. Her personality, drinking habits, and everything that came out of her mouth made me upset, as well as (unfortunately) reminding me of women that I've known who are similar.But that was just me exploring the movie skin deep. About halfway into it, I found myself laughing at Jordan's antics, as well as noticing how much good she was doing for Charlie. She was giving him something extraordinary, that he had never experienced in his life. Have you ever felt like the sky is the limit? Well, with Jordan, I'm sure this was how the character felt. And this is partly why he knew he loved her.The second half of the film brings some unexpected twists, as well as a more dramatic-based dialogue. For anyone who has experienced heartbreak, this will surely push some emotional buttons.The acting in this movie is underrated and overlooked. Especially the contributions of Elisha Cuthbert (Jordan), there is motivation and inner emotion behind every action and every word. I've never been pushed and pulled to such polar opposites by an actor or actress before.This isn't your stock, cliché romantic comedy flick. It provides plenty to ponder over afterward, especially it's great morals and beliefs pertaining to destiny. If you believe in such a phenomenon, you'll only benefit from queuing this up on your Netflix account and witnessing it's artistic perspective.

Why does Hollywood feel the need to take classic non-American films and rape them until they're deformed beyond all recognition? It must be nice to make millions of dollars by doing nothing more than crapping on various works of art from other countries. I'm apparently in the wrong line of business.First off, Jesse Bradford sounds like a weasel and gives a mediocre performance. Just watch his reaction after Elisha Cuthbert lies to his teacher  it's terrible. Cuthbert is your typical Hollywood actress under 30 years of age  very hot, but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Watching her try to be "sassy" is incredibly painful because at times her mannerisms are overly accentuated to the point where she looks like she's got a bad case of hemorrhoids. As far as supporting actors go, the guy who played the runaway soldier was dreadful, and the old man near the end was even worse. Ji-hyun Jun's performance in the original was no fluke. South Korea has at least 5 times as much youthful acting talent than the States. That's no exaggeration.This is your typical Hollywood remake that reenacts a dozen or so scenes from the superior original in unimaginative, idiotic ways (ala "The Departed") in an effort to pander to the dim-wittedness and xenophobia of your typical American moviegoer who would rather slit their wrists than read subtitles. This is evident in the dialogue, which is way too cringeworthy for its own good. Every single line is opaque, thoughtless, and overly simplified to the point of sheer stupidity. Here are some direct quotes from the film: 1. "Death, mandeath sucks!" 2. "I like you and the last three days have been some of the most interesting (if not painful) of my life. But my brain is hemorrhaging and my career is ruined and I just think it's better if we part ways." 3. "Who would be intrigued by a hot, mysterious, passionate, possibly bipolar, violent, drunken, arrogant, rude woman?" 4. "Whatever she was going through  it was beyond anything in my experience and beyond my ability to fix. I had no right to judge her. If I chose to stay with her (knowing the risks) all I could do was give her love and respect and see how the story would end." 5. "I'm sorry. He's just a guy my father made me go out with, but every second I was with him I was wishing it was you and that's why I called you tonight  I couldn't take it anymore. Charlie, I need you." 6. "Hey kid, is this a subway platform or your own piece of drawing paper?" 7. "You know what? I know that you really don't want to hurt me." 8. "Yessss, I'm free and I'm loving it. Train where are you. Wooo hooo. Choo choo."Hollywood translation: "We resent your lack of intelligence, so we are apparently forced to lower the quality of this film by providing superfluous exposition on the part of the characters for the sole purpose of explaining every little thing to you. You are incapable of extracting emotional content from subtle mannerisms, symbolism, or even the slightest bit of indirect communication. Yes, you are a moron, but if we talentless hacks want to make money, we simply need the characters to verbally and plainly explain every little emotion, lest you become completely lost." Am I the only one who realizes just how much Hollywood hates its own fans? At least 90% of their films are devoid of any and all subtlety. This is even worse in the case of remakes, because they must knowingly suck every ounce of intelligence out of the original film. Wake up people. You can cut the patronization with a knife. These movies scream, "You are an imbecile!" And yes, supporting them does make you an imbecile.Oh, but that's not all. If the insipid, moron-proof dialogue weren't bad enough, this movie drops one of the most idiotic psychological twists humanly imaginable. Our two lovebirds decide to take exactly one year off so Cuthbert can heal her wounds, but she shows up 24 hours late because she needed one more arbitrary day for healing. That's beyond ridiculous. Only a Hollywood executive could think of something this mind-numbingly stupid.The only halfway decent moments in this movie use concepts from the original. There's not a shred of well-executed originality to be found in this steaming pile of excrement. The only positives I can think of are a few pretty camerashots. Hence the 2/10 rating. The only comfort I have is that this vile garbage went direct to DVD. A small victory in the neverending battle against the cinematic dark ages that we Americans currently reside in. Cultural naivety, ignorance, repetition, and incredibly low standards seem to be the favored cinematic ideals around here as of late. However, I must say that the original Korean film is still nowhere to be found at your local video store. One might expect a simultaneous DVD release along with the remake. Such is unfortunately not the case.People wonder why I generally hate Hollywood cinema as much as I do, but I ask you  my dear reader  how can I not? I don't like to be patronized by a bunch of talentless hacks in corporate suits who insult my intelligence by making a movie like this and actually expecting me to like it. Maybe I'm missing something, because everyone else around me finds comfort in this masochistic, self-hating existence. My fellow Americans may be flamboyant cowboys in terms of foreign policy, but in terms of entertainment they are the equivalent of abused housewives who keep coming back for more. Whether its ignorance or sheer stupidity, they just don't know any better.May Hollywood burn in hell for all eternity. God knows they deserve it.

As the tagline for this 2008 romantic comedy aptly says, "She's Beautiful, Smart, Funny And Totally Crazy." Jordan (Elisha Cuthbert) is also a thoroughly unpleasant person for most of the film, treating Charlie, a Midwestern kid living in New York City, like dirt, and doing her very best to thoroughly and completely torpedo everything he has going on in his life. Things improve as the film goes on, and you feel more sympathetic towards Jordan. Cuthbert's chemistry with Jesse Bradford is pretty good. There were a few nice moments in this, and a few funny ones as well. The ending is nice...as they always are in movies like this. Elisha Cuthbert is very easy on the eye, and definitely makes 'My Sassy Girl' much more watchable.

Amazing how even after years proving you wrong you 'll still judge a movie by it's covers. I was expecting a full-on romantic flick with color but not so much story on any based reality. Hell that isn't the deal! The film is funny -not to the extreme- with lines that balance well with the story and the background. The Jordan-Charlie writing is so good that is hard to tell if Elisha is really fitted for the role or if you just like Jordan! During the middle it makes a little curve which in my opinion is due to the fact that the movie is too short in contrast too the story.It is probably a must see if you are on your 20's.It also a must see if you like Elisha Cuthbert. You gonna like her even more.One last thing that made me watch this movie is the fact that Yann Samuell(Jeux d'enfants(2003))directed it. He obviously has his ways with love stories.7/10

Watch the Korean version first. This version will just act as a spoiler. This is Hollywood just taking the short cut. Look at what is huge in other countries and ripping it off. I was fortunate enough to see the Korean version first, if I hadn't this would have lessened the impact.The acting was only OK. A lot of the emotion was zapped out of the story. In the Korean version the Sassy girl was played and presented better. You knew there was something intriguing about the girl. She seemed emotionally hurt. In this version she seemed more psychotic, She just seemed to attack.

I can't say I understand the "original versus remake" fight. Yes, it's a remake, so what? The original one may be better, but this doesn't make this one unwatchable! So, for all remake haters: how much people do you think would've heard of this movie in it's original version as long as we know it's a 2001 film and the publicity it had was really weak? The remake it's really good fun, it's a romantic comedy, love story, fairy tale, whatever you wanna name it, it's gooood !!!!I liked this movie because of the story, it's uncommon, it's unpredictable! Honestly, I'm tired of the classic comedy where boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy get's girl back or vice-versa. This one actually made me feel the story and believe the characters.Totally watchable. Totally underrated. Totally...excellent! Enjoy!

I usually do not like remakes of movies but this one wasn't half as bad as the ones I have seen in the past. I mean look how honest it was and remakes usually don't do that. I mean this remake really had me thinking how does one get over a great love. And yes her way was a little crazy but she also helped him in a way only it takes awhile to realize it.I think they tried to make it as honest as possible for Americans which I love. We like to censored our movies more than other countries but even so not that bad people. I know that us as Americans love movies we don't have to read, but sometimes reading subtitles is truly worth it. This movie was great but the first one was better because it was funnier and it had way more emotion. And I like how in the original the girl had no fear she did what she wanted when she wanted. Especially the train scene that they did not put in the remake. Maybe remake movies would be better if you make them exactly like the first one in our languages.But I love the fact they picked Elisha because she has that whole sweet innocent crazy girl going on like her movie the girl next door. She is really growing as an actress.

I haven't really watched the original from start to end, so I can't say for sure how well this version was vis-a-vis the Korean one, which shot Jeon Ji-Hyun to prominence in the starring role. The Hollywood remake however, went straight to DVD, but you know that it's Uniquely Singapore that we give DVD releases a chance on our big screens. That said, I thought this remake wasn't as bad as it was made out to be, what with some screaming blasphemy, and calling it inferior.Truth is, I was entertained from start to end, nevermind if certain scenes seemed implausible. After all, this is a romantic movie, and in the genre, if the man says he's gonna fetch a moon, he jolly well plucks it out from the night sky and delivers it. And if we're talking about implausible romance sequences here, then director Yann Samuell would be the right guy at the helm, after all, he brought us the French movie Love Me If You Dare.Elisha Cuthbert takes over the role immortalized by Jeon Ji-Hyun, as Jordan Roark (whose last name becomes a running joke) the ditzy, crazy and perpetually drunk lass whom Charlie Bellow (Jesse Bradford) falls for in one random night where he saves her from potentially injuring/killing herself at the subway. So begins the abusive person versus the Mr straight- laced all round nice guy in comic routine after comic routine, which for the most parts, weren't exactly funny to begin with. And their outings all stem from her dictating where and what time to meet, in which he dutifully obeys, not knowing what's in it for him.Maybe he's a wuss but I guess it stemmed from his being a romantic and genuinely wanting to do whatever she dictated, for the simple reason that he's smitten. After all, I guess who wouldn't, given her attractiveness, and the extremely strange circumstances, which do get explained, in which she behaves. But while both leads are good looking, they do lack a certain chemistry when with each other, making it look like a very forced meeting of lovebirds, in a very artificial way.That aside, the movie does have its slick ending to thank for in weaving together their respective back stories, though they do detract and distract from the main narrative, and bring some attention to how beautiful those shots were made, in having to integrate seamlessly one scene to the next. And its concept of Destiny, and dealing with it, on one hand felt completely honest with its building of bridges to each other, of having to know it and to work at it, but alas the movie eventually fell back on what it had preached, opting instead to leave it to the stars, and a very quick and coincidental one at that, which you can see coming from miles away.I guess for those who have not seen the original, we might be blown away by the story and revelation, given that Korean romantic movies/weepies do not come only at face value. However, having seen some Korean remakes, I would reckon that those who have seen the original will call this a travesty. The jury's still out however, until I get my hands on its Korean predecessor, and then I'll let you know what I think. That I believe I should be able to do so since this version has intrigued me to give the original another go.Otherwise, this movie's still adequate for a decent romantic date. I did however, feel sorry for actresses who played the 11 Woman of No Consequence - sheesh, what a title!

Charlie Bellows (Jesse Bradford) is from a small Indiana town, where his dad repairs machinery for a knock-off John Deere company. The Bellows save and save for Charlie's education, for their dearest wish is for him to become a top officer of the tractor company. When Charlie is accepted at an elite college in Manhattan, it seems dreams can come true. However, just as Charlie is settling in and keeping his eye on the prize, a woman totally diverts his path. Beautiful Jordan (Elisha Cuthbert) appears very drunk and lands on a subway track. Yes, indeed, Charlie rescues her. It soon becomes a pattern, as Jordan self proclaims that she is in a "reckless" phase. Yet, an unlikely friendship emerges, with offbeat dates like breaking into a seasonally closed amusement park and riding the ghost tunnel. Yet, Jordan never wants the relationship to go beyond palsies. In fact, there are secrets and, to Charlie's dismay, Jordan suggests the duo writes their wishes for each other in letters. The notes are to be cast into a time capsule and buried for a year in Central Park. When 365 days are past, then this gal and gent will meet again to discover what their future holds. In the meanwhile, Jordan's eccentric behavior may have nixed Charlie's chances of landing a top job with John Deere-like. What, what will happen? This movie turns out to be an adaption of a widely praised Korean film. This viewer didn't see the original but, most likely, some things don't translate well. While this a fairly well done romantic comedy with two nice leads in Bradford and Cuthbert, its not a four star winner. The script is very imaginative, with plenty of quirks while the sets, costumes, and direction are acceptable. With the romcom on Hollywood's endangered species' list, most fans of the genre will want grab this one while they can.

why why why? they have just destroyed the classic of the original Korean movie....MY SASSY GIRL. Please watch the original movie before u watch this movie, because they have mix the scene altogether.....plus some very poor acting by the cast...this movie should be named has not MY SASSY GIRL...also in this movie it does not explain the full story of the girl. like in the original movie... its stupid, boring and waste of time please please watch the original version of my sassy girl and now u can even watch the uncut version of the original movie...this movie...well u can burn it....because if u watch this movie you'll be wasting your time

As someone who's seen both movies, I can't say I am obliged to hate this one (nor I think anyone should). Matter of fact is, there is much to enjoy from this as well, specially photography and scenery, and if you come to me saying that its a knockout just because it takes place in NY, then by all means, please go and try enjoy life. So what its a remake, this was still very much enjoyable and a extremely well told story.If you have such strong feelings that just because there was an original one you have to hate on this one, then odds are you're missing tons of stuff in life.

It's easy to be cynical about Hollywood's efforts to remake Asian hits for an Amrican audience when the results are as poor as they are here. A lacklustre effort that fails to generate even a smidgen of the Korea original, 'My Sassy Girl' falls flat on almost every count.It's surprising, actually, given the talent involved. Yann Samuel, who directed the devilishy funny 'Love Me If You Dare', helms the picture, and it stars Jesse Bradford as well as the lovely Elisha Cuthbert. They're all good in their own rights, but somehow the chemistry never quite works.'Love Me If You Dare' had a similar premise, actually, and it's surprising that Samuel never quite finds the right tone here. Neither he nor his actors ever get into a comfortable rhythm.First Maq.

My sassy girl is a remake of the Korean movie of the same name. unfortunately it is not as good as the original Korean one and i just didn't like it very much. the original has better acting and this one doesn't outshine the original with it's acting. the girl in this movie doesn't play the part very well and the guy just doesn't do anything for me. if your going to use the (almost) exact same scenes you should at least do better than the one you are remaking.... if you want to see this movie i suggest watching the original with subtitles (which can be found on the internet) in my opinion it's better. feel free to disagree and compare them yourself. see which one you think is best. the original Korean one was made in 2001 and the American one was made in 2008 (to clear up any confusion). sorry if this offends but i fell this remake was a flop.

I'm rather ill-informed compared to most of the other reviewers. A friend loaned this to me along with 7 other DVDs and I knew absolutely nothing about it or its stars. In fact, with the names Elisha and Jesse, I assumed that Elisha was the male and Jesse was the female. Oops! And I had no idea that this was an Americanization of a highly acclaimed Korean film as I don't believe I have ever watched a Korean film in my life. So my esteemed international colleagues may justifiably think of me as The Ugly American (I am nobody's George Clooney).All that said,I enjoyed this movie immensely. It frequently caught me as off-balance and surprised as the male lead. In some ways, it reminded a bit of Bringing Up Baby and a few earlier '30's screwball comedies with Breakfast at Tiffany's. It also reminded me a bit of The Shape of Things. The pacing was great, the fast-forward photography was well-inserted. This is refreshingly good masochistic fun.

It is common for people to console someone who is suffering for love or for never having really experienced it by saying that when you least expect it, a great passion can arise. Those who cling to such thinking inevitably start to idealize the moment of this meeting with all the pomp of a Hollywood movie, being able to even imagine themselves experiencing somewhat cliché situations and dialogues. Fueled by these fantasies, thousands of people go about their lives until the big day arrives, however, when the love of their lives is finally near, it can go unnoticed due to circumstances that do not resemble their dreams at all. This is how the love of the protagonist couple of "My Sassy Girl" begins, which invests in subtle humor to win over the viewer, but in the final stretch resorts to melodrama.The film begins by introducing us to Charlie Bellow (Jesse Bradford), a young man who is alone in the middle of an autumnal landscape saying that to understand how he got there you need to know his story from the beginning. He grew up in a quiet town and his parents did everything to give him a good education so that he could enter a renowned university to study business and, who knows, follow in the same professional footsteps as his father. Raised in a traditionalist environment and with his future partially mapped out, there wasn't much for Bellow to worry about, but what about his personal life? He goes to live alone in New York dreaming of a better position in the job market, but unlike most singles he is not a flirtatious guy nor adept at casual sex, which sounds strange to many, like his friend Leo (Austin Basis) who tries to encourage the boy to have fun and be cooler. Once asked what kind of girl would make him lose his mind, Bellow randomly locks eyes with Jordan Roark (Elisha Cuthbert), a young woman who seems full of attitude and personality. She already says the popular saying that opposites attract, so she would be the perfect girl for a more peaceful and down to earth young man. This moment could be typical of cinema, but they don't exchange a single word, they don't even approach, but fate wanted the two to meet. Bellow finds the girl again at the subway station, screaming for someone and putting herself at risk near the tracks. After a bizarre fit of emotions, Jordan ends up taking her home. In the same way that she appeared in her life, the girl disappears the next day, but soon gets in touch asking, or rather demanding, a meeting with the one who extended her hand.Bellow then notices that the girl is witty, always has a retort or joke on the tip of her tongue, but deep down she seems a little out of place. Probably the joy she shows is the way she found to deal with some frustration. Other encounters take place and so they start dating naturally, the young man no longer caring about the many losses of job opportunities to be able to stay with his girlfriend whose favorite hobby is writing stories that he believes have the potential to become movie scripts. Interestingly, her texts always take place in future times, yet another proof that she does everything to escape reality. In a fun sequence starring the couple themselves, she even reinvents the plot of the movie Titanic in the year 2037 with the famous Jack and Rose again separated by the collision of the ship with an iceberg, after all she is sure that man never learns from his mistakes. All of Jordan's madness, between moments of joy and outbursts of anger or sadness, ends up infecting the boyfriend who ends up exceeding himself in the fun and necessarily meets her father, Dr. Roark (Chris Sarandon), a doctor who ends up attending to the boy after he falls and hits his head. He exchanges medicine and exams for advice: he wants to see him away from his daughter, as he considers him a bad influence that makes her lose her sense of boundaries.Until then we are left wondering what kind of novel is this? How can anyone fall in love with such a strange figure and such a fickle temper? Many may already be bored or confused, but romance fans may like the plot twists. There comes a moment when Bellow realizes that while Jordan does him good, she also seems inclined to destroy him, but even listing all her faults ends up coming to the conclusion that he is really in love with the crazy girl. Between encounters and disagreements, we will only know the real reason for the girl's behavior and her fixation on her current boyfriend when the narrative returns to the starting point, the park in which Bellow is at the foot of a tree with a peculiar image and of great importance to the couple. Such secrets are even more predictable when the girl's father looks for the possible son-in-law to apologize and assume that he treated him badly thinking he was just another one who took advantage of the weakness of his daughter who constantly returned home in the company of strangers for being drunk in an attempt to drown sorrows.One of the film's greatest strengths is the chemistry between the leads, Elisha Cuthbert and Jesse Bradford. Her performance is endearing and entertaining, bringing the dynamic between Charlie and Jordan to life in an enchanting way. Cuthbert delivers a compelling portrayal of Jordan, an enigmatic and unpredictable young woman who keeps the viewer intrigued with her unexpected actions. She conveys the complexity of the character, switching between moments of vulnerability and defiance with ease. On the other hand, Bradford portrays Charlie with sensitivity and vulnerability, giving the film a solid emotional foundation. Her performance is moving, capturing the genuine emotions of someone discovering love and facing the ups and downs of an unusual relationship."My Sassy Girl" features several memorable and emotional scenes that contribute to the development of the plot and the evolution of the characters. Below, I detail some of the main scenes of the film: The Meeting on the Train, where the first meeting between Charlie and Jordan takes place on the train. Jordan is visibly drunk and behaves erratically and unpredictably. She ends up falling asleep on Charlie's shoulder, who is both confused and delighted by the situation. This scene is the starting point for the unusual relationship between the two, as it marks the beginning of their emotional connection.The relationship between Charlie and Jordan is full of unusual and even crazy situations. In an iconic scene, Jordan dares Charlie to perform a series of awkward actions in public, such as awkwardly dancing in a subway station. The scene is funny and reveals Jordan's eccentric nature, as well as Charlie's willingness to accept her eccentricities. Another scene to stand out is Jordan's outburst, in which the girl in an emotionally powerful moment, Jordan finally reveals to Charlie the reason behind her unpredictable actions. She shares with him the painful story of her past and her emotional struggles. This scene is a crucial point in the development of their relationship, as it allows Charlie to better understand Jordan's complexity and help her face her own traumas. As the film nears its climax, Charlie is faced with a difficult decision that could determine the future of her relationship with Jordan. This scene is emotionally charged as Charlie faces his own insecurities and has to decide if he is willing to risk everything for true love. The film is a combination of funny, touching and emotional moments that reflect the complexity of human relationships and the transformative power of love.The direction of Yann Samuell is another positive point of the film. The director embraces the vibrant and chaotic energy of the characters, creating a happy and unpredictable atmosphere that reflects the nature of the relationship between Charlie and Jordan. He skillfully balances moments of humor and romance, creating an engaging experience for audiences. In addition, even with nothing really innovative and with some plans that are super conventional and even without visual appeal, Samuell's direction offers a sensitive view of the emotional journey of the characters, allowing the viewer to connect with their experiences in an authentic way. The film's plot is a fun and exciting exploration of how a relationship can transform people and make them open to new possibilities. The plot addresses themes such as personal growth, the importance of authenticity and acceptance of oneself and others. The relationship between Charlie and Jordan builds gradually, and each stage of that development is sensitively handled by the script. Moments of humor and romance are balanced, avoiding making the story too light or too dramatic. Instead, the film presents a genuine journey of self-discovery, building empathy and emotional connection with the characters.However, it is important to mention that the film can be overly sentimental and predictable at times. Some situations and plot twists can feel a bit forced, which can affect the film's emotional impact. Furthermore, while the central relationship is developed in an engaging way, some secondary characters are not given the same care and end up becoming stereotyped or underdeveloped. With a different third act, even if predictable and appealing, "My Sassy Girl" is a charming romantic comedy, which although it has some flaws, is a fun option for romantic comedy lovers looking for a captivating story about the transformative power of love and acceptance. The combination of the beautiful and charming Elisha Cuthbert and Jesse Bradford, Yann Samuell's sensitive direction and a genuine story of self-discovery make "My Sassy Girl" a pleasant and exciting cinematic experience, even if it does not deviate much from the formula of exemplars of the genre.

Im a big fan of the original Korean version. This Hollywood remake is a total failure.The screenplay is bad. The story is much less convincing than the original. In the original version, the girl was heartbroken, whose fiancé was killed in a tragic accident, and was really sassy. This made her character inner conflicted. On one side, she was a vulnerable, heartbroken girl. She was so beautiful, so sweet, so sad, like a princess lost her prince. On the other side, she was a furious, sassy, horrible lady. She was mad at the God, at life, and even at herself. According to the typical social standard she was not a decent girl. But sometimes， as i said, she is so sweet.In the meantime, her boy, the boy, was confused. He had no idea about the accident. The girl was just a sassy beautiful girl. Himself, was a lazy, yet naive boy. He took what the life gave him. Hardworking was not in his book. One day a beautiful girl came into his life. He didn't even know what was going on. He didn't even like the girl at first.In the days he was with the girl, he was silently changed by the girl. From a outsider to a hardworking, life-loving boy.The remake, however, gives us a geek who had a glorious future b4 he met the girl. In less than half an hour, they seems bonded so much because of no reason. and What happened next seems so fake. Too much acting but no true feelings.In order to avoid the spoilers, there are few details above about the remake one.The only reason to watch the remake is to know how remarkable the Korean version is and how trash this remake could be.
