GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four)	"Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, slick, stylish action picture with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking automobiles. If you are a viewer interested in cars this production, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air," "The Rock"), is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles. Although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride.	The film stars Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad") as a young crook named Kip Raines, who, as the movie opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened because of such, his older brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars-specified by model, color, year, and make-in only four days.
	Memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing Memphis through previous business, a fellow named Mirror Man (T.J. Cross), the aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott), and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). 	Contributing to the film's drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that Memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them.There is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core, stylish atmosphere. To make matters even worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone. I am not stating I think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish; I actually honor the director's decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an R-rating. However, I do believe in a movie such as "Gone in 60 Seconds," to strongly develop the character's enlightenment, dialogue needs to be believable and authentic. 
 In spite of problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch, perfectly cast performers responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles.	The film contains standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story's style and the character's motives, sets up a fast-paced theme of action, but lacks depth and strong character introduction. In the second act we run into a few more problems: the story wastes time during much of this segment, never really building up for the third act. While the middle of the movie occupies much time, and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot,  not a whole lot happens. The third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed.
	The soundtrack to "Gone in 60 Seconds" contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. It is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. Dominic Sena, whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion, thrills, and excitementÂ…but not much more.

Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) is a brash car thief. His brother Memphis (Nicolas Cage) retired from the business to run a kiddie go-cart business. After a Kip screw up, Atley Jackson (Will Patton) forces Memphis to take over the job as the villain Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston) keeps Kip hostage. Memphis has to steal 50 specific cars in 4 days. He reassembles some of his old crew with Kip's new crew. Detectives Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant) are hot on his trail.Ribisi is his usual jittery hopeless loser character. Cage is toned down in this one. In a sense, that's indicative of a missed opportunity. It tries to be serious a little and that's the wrong path. This needs to be silly and fun. It also needs more Jolie who is really only tied for the third lead with a dozen other actors. This really needs to be fun wall-to-wall car chases. There is not enough of them and after an initial chase, it takes too long to get to the next one.

GONE IN 60 SECONDS was one of the most fun experiences I've had at the theater in the last couple of years. Though a little too long and not really full of action until the final twenty minutes, it moves well and has a good cast: Nicolas Cage, Will Patton, Robert Duvall, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo, Christopher Eccleston, and others. Angelina Jolie is the only weak point. She's in desperate need of a talented hairstylist, and while she's hardly a good actress, she really doesn't do much in the film when you look at it, which is a good thing. But the film has style and a good pace, with some great theft scenes, well-spotted humor, and a final chase that (while not among the greatest ever filmed) is certainly a wild ride. GONE IN 60 SECONDS isn't a great film, but it sure as hell is fun.

This is one of those films I liked quite a bit the first time, but didn't think that much of it on the second viewing. I guess enough of it was just good for one look. Maybe it was the immature attitude that prevailed throughout the film that wore thin. But I am not going to knock the movie: it's entertaining and definitely worth a look if you have not seen it.If you like cars and chase scenes. t's worth multiple looks. In fact, the car chase scene at the end is one of the best you'll ever see. Nice soundtrack in here, too, and a pretty good cast with Nicholas Cage leading the way.The bad news? Well, here's yet another case of Hollywood making "bad guys" into heroes. We're supposed to root for people that steal cars? Hello??!!

A flashy, high-octane blockbuster movie with a big budget, big cast, and lots of adrenaline-pumping action, including a spectacular dramatic car chase which is very exciting to watch. One thing confuses me: why all the negative reviews? It seems that few if any people actually admit to liking this film, most of them slagging it off for being lame brained, over-the-top entertainment. That may be so, but I'm a sucker for action movies and this one hit the mark as far as I'm concerned. It may not be the best film ever made, it may not even be a very good one, but it packs in the excitement where it counts.Coming from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable, the film is packed full of the quick editing and noisy music we've come to expect from the producer of movies like CON AIR and Armageddon. Although the movie is quite slow to begin with, and it seems to take an age for the car-stealing to actually begin, once it does you won't be disappointed. Bruckheimer has assembled an all-star cast for his movie and although many of the actors and actresses are wasted, it's nice to have their presence felt nonetheless. A case in point is Robert Duvall: he has about fifteen minutes max screen time as the wise old man. A blond-haired Nicolas Cage takes the lead and puts in a rather subdued and forgettable performance, whilst in comparison Christopher Eccleston goes way over the top as the manic bad guy. Angelina Jolie lends the film some glamour but, in a film about expensive, beautiful sports cars, her presence is rather unnecessary. Giovanni Ribisi plays another brain dead moron to a realistic effect, while faces like those of Will Patton and Vinnie Jones fill out minor roles, the latter to great effect as a mute hard man.Okay, okay, I can see this film's flaws. The cheesy sentimentalising creeps in a bit too often for my liking, and all of the action is concentrated near the end instead of being spread out. However, I still stand by my words that the finale is a fantastic piece of work and that this is a great, easy viewing popcorn experience which doesn't disappoint. Just watch it expecting a movie with cool action AND wit, like THE MATRIX.

As much as I like big epic pictures - I'll spare you the namedropping - it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes. Films where the plot takes a backseat to the set-pieces. Films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose. There are HUNDREDS of films that fit the bill... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones.It's an update of the movie that shares its name. It also shares that picture's ethos, but not quite it's execution. Whatever was great about the original has been streamlined. Whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget. Often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster - see the pug-ugly remake of The Italian Job for one that blew it - but here, thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors, Sixty succeeds.The plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write IMDb about. Often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors, each of whom will voice it with different inflections. A lot of people found this annoying; I find it raises a smile. Each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall leading the pack of course (and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see Mrs Pitt not given first billing here). The chemistry between good ol' Saint Nick the stalwart (see date of review) and Angelina leads to a couple of nice moments.The villain is not even a little scary - I've seen Chris Eccleston play tough-guy roles before so I know he can handle them, but I think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action. We know the heroes are going to succeed, somehow; we're just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the ride. I think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in-cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating. In fact, I wouldn't have minded some fourth-wall breaking winks at the camera: it's just that kind of movie.All this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not executed *just* so - would be worthless if the action wasn't there. And for the most part, it is. Wonderfully so. I've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast-cut extreme close-up shots to direct action these days. I personally find this kind of thing exhausting. I prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time. I've been told that Cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance (in real life I mean - his character clearly doesn't care) and it shows. The man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow-burning climatic finale where he drives a Mustang into the ground in the most outlandish - and FUN - way possible.So yes, this movie isn't an "epic, life-affirming post-9/11 picture with obligatory social commentary" effort. The pacing is uneven, some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line. But car movies rarely come better than this. So if you hate cars... why are you even reading these comments?!I'd take it over the numerous iterations of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" (guess the franchise) any day. 7/10

This one of those movies that just radiates cool. Nic Cage is at his best, the soundtrack is outstanding, and the premise is unique. All of the characters are well cast and badass. Gone in 60 seconds is just a good time.

To make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about Kip (Giovanni Ribsi), a car thief, who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars (50 in total). He is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the 'order'. The objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days, with the help of Randall (Nicolas Cage), a 'retired' booster and also Kip's brother and a couple of old friends of Randall's. As you can see this is the same old, big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course Randall is the best thief there ever was. Of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy about the story.OK the only downsides I felt while watching this movie was, that there is not very much action, there is one totally unrealistic scene, the story is only OK and that there are not much jokes. Hey but after seeing the whole film I must say: WHO CARES. Why must I say that, well because it was still entertaining; had a couple of cool car chases; good music; some Bruckheimer scenes (where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet); good actors who all did their jobs; pretty cars and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with. So some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie. All in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall OK movie with a cool - feelgood ending.As for Nicolas Cage, well He is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as The Rock, Con Air, Face / Off, Snake Eyes and finally this one. Plus what actor has had so many good action / thriller's in the last years and such successful ones ? Well no one!!! Maybe Jackie Chan, but he is one of my favourites too. One thing that is true though about Mr. Cages Bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse. The Rock, was a clear 9, Con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7. Not that that mark is bad. Does it not show that his films under Bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe Cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? No it doesn't show us that, because almost all of Cage's films were successful in the last few years, except for 8mm and Bringing out the Dead. 8mm was not great, I admit that, but that was never Cage's fault and the story seemed good to me. About the latter film I can not say anything, 'cause I have not seen it yet. One thing though I know for sure, if Bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films, I would have said YES to all of them. I would have said yes to The Rock, because the story was great and because you would get to play with Sean Connery and Ed Harris. I would have said yes to Con Air, because there would be a lot of action in it, because the story was good and because you got to act with John Malkovich and Ving Rhames. In this one I would have starred because I would have gotten a big paycheque, I would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because I would have been able to kiss Angelina Jolie (can't wait to see her in that Lara Croft outfit). This one was a good choice of Mr. Cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre.7 out of 10Note: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time. Apologies for any offence caused. I was young and stupid at the time, thinking I was being 'cool'.

Most of this movie, it seems, revolves around scenes in a garage where the lead actors tell the audience what they're going to do. The actual doing is then reduced to quick, almost montage-like scenes of the cars being stolen.The film is essentially a car chase (at the end) padded out with lots of mostly unimportant dialogue and scenes (the rest of the movie). As an example, the pace of the movie grinds to a halt when, having found the keys for three Mercedes cars they need, the dog swallows them. There's then an entirely unfunny set of scenes involving ex-lax and waiting for the dog to crap out the keys. All the while you keep hoping the movie will continue but it doesn't until the dog poops up the keys.The film is saved only by the final car chase, which rivals anything the Matrix series has provided, and which has the only half-way decent cinematic portrayal of what a compressed gas cylinder will do if the valve snaps off. Also a saving grace is Vinnie Jones - awful actor, but you can't help but like him anyway. His few scenes are worth looking out for.And that's about it for Gi60S. Mostly dull with a few spots of brightness and a good car chase at the end.

This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, Oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant "Bruck-buster" action at its best. Fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also, for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!

... calling it gone in 60 seconds. just imagine the stupid lines critics can use this title for. like : - I wish that I was gone out of the theater in 60 seconds. - exactly the time it takes to forget this film ,.....And the worst part of it is that itÂ´s true ! I went to see this because of all the car chases and crashes. Who didnÂ´t ? But.... nothing. I donÂ´t really want to talk about the plot or the characters because there simply is nothing of these things in the film. Cars are too expensive to crash and about 45 minutes nothing happens at all. And then ... the final chase. This is supposed to be the final chase in a car racing movie ? Every computer game is more exciting than this ! This film suffers from the M:I 2 Syndrome. Action movie with no action !-frightening !

A film that by the synopsis should appeal to all teens but it felt like the Writers forgot that, Apart from the ending there was literally no car chases and little action, The plot was ok but even though their task was near impossible they never felt like they were in any problems doing it, It had quite a big cast and they all did their best but I don't think they really needed Angelina Jolie as she offered nothing that was needed and wasn't even used for her sex appeal, The ending was pretty fun as it felt like they saved all their budget on it, With some good chases and a few ok stunts but as I said earlier it never felt like there was any danger in completing his mission and got very predictable, It's not a bad movie but it should of been so much more fun.

I admit that `Gone In 60 Seconds' is no `Gone With The Wind', but it does have some admiring qualities. This action-packed bubble-gum summer smash is about a former car thief who joins up with his old `stealers' team in order to do some quick car-jacking so his brother's life could be spared. Yes! It does include some of the idiotic theme plots that destroys action films: boring kidnappings, repetitious slogans, and lengthy chase scenes. These qualities should have been put on reverse in the editing room. However, what drove me crazy about the film is the chemistry or should i say gaseous substance between stars Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie. My eyes were tailgated on screen whenever they shared scenes together. `Gone In 60 seconds' is no autobahn, but it is definitely worth the ride.*** Average

I have mixed feelings about this movie. I do prefer movies that are a little more... intelligent per say, but I still feel Gone in Sixty Seconds is quite underrated. Actually, my biggest complaint is that the movie was too short. There was simply too much story and way to many characters to fit into the movie's time frame.The basic story is about a car thief, (Cage) who has achieved legendary status and then retired. His younger brother, trying to be like his brother, falls into car boosting too, but soon gets in too deep and ends up on the hit-list of a ruthless crime lord after he messes up a very important job. Now, the only way to save his brother's life is for Cage to come out of retirement and finish the job: Strealing fifty high profile cars in one night. Together with many other top thieves, they set out to do the impossible.While the cast is truly star studded, with big names such as Nicholas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Rober Duvall, most of the acting and characters aren't that sympathetic. The movie simply has too many characters to really get deeply into any of them. Delroy Lindo does a fairly engaging job as the old arch-nemesis of the protagonist, and Cage is good as usual, but the rest of the cast is nothing special, except perhaps for the mysterious coroner who never talks, Sphynx.But, the movie is still worth watching for the suspenseful action and the truly incredible chase scene at the end. Is there anything more beautiful then that Shelby Mustang GT, nicknamed Eleanor, roaring down the streets of Los Angoles? There are many other exotic cars in this movie too, from a very unique Hummer to a Lambourgini Diablo.Don't go into this movie expecting a deep and involving, dramatic story. While it does attempt at this, it doesn't necessarily succeed. But the action is suspenseful and although a tad unrealistic at times, it is a great kick to watch. This movie is better then the average action movie. A true classic for the car chase genre.My rating: **1/2 out of **** Other recommendations: Bourne Supremacy, The Italian Job (1969), Smokey and the Bandit

This movie doesn't tell you any new truth or treat your refined taste with amazing characters.  It is just an old-fashioned chase movie of the good and the bad guys.  The circumstances and the grand theft of 50 cars over one night is of course out of this world but it doesn't matter because Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie charm us out of it.  After watching hundreds of car chase movies in my lifetime I didn't think yet another one would lighten my eyebrow.  I was wrong.  The smart and humorous execution of the car and car/helicopter chases was a great fun to watch; a good honest adrenalin booster.  Perhaps I am little generous but I give it 8/10 for all the fun.

I'm a huge fan of Cage. An even bigger fan of cars. And by my terms , the biggest fan of Jolie. Whaddayaknow! Gone in 60 seconds was one heck of a good movie. They have some awesome lines in this car thriller. To quote a few,"The cars are on the boat or your brothers in the coffin." "Metals cold , ugly. Woods warm provided by nature. Watching a piece of furniture take shape is like watching a child grow." "You have 60 seconds to consider your options. .................. ......................... be a big brother." "Then bring me his brother. One Raines is as good as the other. It never rains but it pours." .......and so many more. I understand that IMDb has a database of these quotes. But it was worth mentioning them cause that is what makes up this movie apart from cars. They have such awesome cars and lines, you wouldn't care about character development, really. Although, you must give it to Cage for having dug out an awesome performance for his character "Memphis" Raines. A thought for the soundtrack too: I fell in love with "The Cult" after I heard "Painted on my Heart" play swan song to a beautiful Lamborghini. I frankly don't understand why people are giving this movie a hard time ! What did they expect? An aria boosting 50 top end cars at the Sydney Opera House?

I've not had the opportunity to see the original, so i can compare the two, but the remake is very much worth watching. It has a very strong cast with lots of action. I think it would be better without the little bit of the ending where there's a chase that has improbable actions.I think what makes this so strong it truly the cast especially having rewatched it after many years and being able to look back at so many fine actors. If anything, there's essentially only one actresses, Jolie, who does a great job, but I think there should have been more actresses and they easily could have been put into the script.And the DOG IS GREAT. I love animals, and this dog has awesome expressions.

It also needs more Jolie who is really only tied for the third lead with a dozen other actors. This really needs to be fun wall-to-wall car chases. There is not enough of them and after an initial chase, it takes too long to get to the next one.

What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer expect it to be filled with action.In producer Bruckheimer's latest film, Gone in 60 Seconds, its all about the nomenclature.  With character monikers like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and cars idealized with names like Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it's only the non-stop action that keeps you from wanting to just play the name game.Not a deep script by any means, but it is a great vehicle for action as Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, comes out of car-thievery retirement to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night.  A remake of the 1974 cult hit, this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining.Surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting. Although loaded with stars, none of them have standout performances, including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers, Giovanni Ribisi.  Even Jolie, coming off her recent Oscar win, is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time.Can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film?  I think so.  The film is a pleasure to look at and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelieveablity, the action is non-stop and the suspense is compelling.  Just be wary of other drivers fighting for a pole position as you leave the theatre.3 1/2 out of 5

GONE IN 60 SECONDS was one of the most fun experiences I've had at the theater in the last couple of years. Though a little too long and not really full of action until the final twenty minutes, it moves well and has a good cast: Nicolas Cage, Will Patton, Robert Duvall, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo, Christopher Eccleston, and others. Angelina Jolie is the only weak point. She's in desperate need of a talented hairstylist, and while she's hardly a good actress, she really doesn't do much in the film when you look at it, which is a good thing. But the film has style and a good pace, with some great theft scenes, well-spotted humor, and a final chase that (while not among the greatest ever filmed) is certainly a wild ride. GONE IN 60 SECONDS isn't a great film, but it sure as hell is fun.

Also, poor Nicholas Cage, I knew him well... Once upon a time (possibly in Las Vegas) he was a Box Office heavyweight. Now... well, you can probably pick up one of his latest films from those buckets you find of DVDs for Â£2.99 in petrol stations. However, before his decent into depressingly-bad cinema, he made some pretty fun films. Yes, he's won an Oscar in his time for his deep and meaningful acting, but you won't find any of that here. Just fun.Nicholas Cage plays (basically) Nicholas Cage â€“ only a Nicholas Cage who used to steal expensive cars, only to retire. However, his loose cannon of a brother steals (or doesn't steal â€“ I forget â€“ it doesn't matter!) for (or from) the wrong mobster in L.A. meaning Nicholas Cage the now not-so retired car thief must steal a load of flash motors in one night or his brother ends up in the car crusher (literally!).If you like fast cars driving even faster (and, judging by the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise a lot of people do) then this one is basically for you. It's an action film and it's pretty much by the numbers, but, when it's such fun, who cares? Everyone cranks their performances up to eleven and it all comes across as one of those adorable eighties and nineties 'over-the-top' action flicks (yes, I know it was made it in 2000, but it sure feels like a nineties movie) with a real cartoony vibe to it. You have Christopher Ecleston plays the 'evil Brit villain' much like any other evil Brit villains you've seen in cinema. Vinnie Jones and Angelina Jolie are on hand to show their faces, but feel a little underused for what they could have been.Ultimately, it's all on Nicholas Cage's manic shoulders and he does the film proud. It's loud, dumb and it's basically one long car crash that you'll probably be unable to tear your eyes away from.

This is one of those films I liked quite a bit the first time, but didn't think that much of it on the second viewing. I guess enough of it was just good for one look. Maybe it was the immature attitude that prevailed throughout the film that wore thin. But I am not going to knock the movie: it's entertaining and definitely worth a look if you have not seen it.If you like cars and chase scenes. t's worth multiple looks. In fact, the car chase scene at the end is one of the best you'll ever see. Nice soundtrack in here, too, and a pretty good cast with Nicholas Cage leading the way.The bad news? Well, here's yet another case of Hollywood making "bad guys" into heroes. We're supposed to root for people that steal cars? Hello??!!

A flashy, high-octane blockbuster movie with a big budget, big cast, and lots of adrenaline-pumping action, including a spectacular dramatic car chase which is very exciting to watch. One thing confuses me: why all the negative reviews? It seems that few if any people actually admit to liking this film, most of them slagging it off for being lame brained, over-the-top entertainment. That may be so, but I'm a sucker for action movies and this one hit the mark as far as I'm concerned. It may not be the best film ever made, it may not even be a very good one, but it packs in the excitement where it counts.Coming from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable, the film is packed full of the quick editing and noisy music we've come to expect from the producer of movies like CON AIR and Armageddon. Although the movie is quite slow to begin with, and it seems to take an age for the car-stealing to actually begin, once it does you won't be disappointed. Bruckheimer has assembled an all-star cast for his movie and although many of the actors and actresses are wasted, it's nice to have their presence felt nonetheless. A case in point is Robert Duvall: he has about fifteen minutes max screen time as the wise old man. A blond-haired Nicolas Cage takes the lead and puts in a rather subdued and forgettable performance, whilst in comparison Christopher Eccleston goes way over the top as the manic bad guy. Angelina Jolie lends the film some glamour but, in a film about expensive, beautiful sports cars, her presence is rather unnecessary. Giovanni Ribisi plays another brain dead moron to a realistic effect, while faces like those of Will Patton and Vinnie Jones fill out minor roles, the latter to great effect as a mute hard man.Okay, okay, I can see this film's flaws. The cheesy sentimentalising creeps in a bit too often for my liking, and all of the action is concentrated near the end instead of being spread out. However, I still stand by my words that the finale is a fantastic piece of work and that this is a great, easy viewing popcorn experience which doesn't disappoint. Just watch it expecting a movie with cool action AND wit, like THE MATRIX.

As much as I like big epic pictures - I'll spare you the namedropping - it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes. Films where the plot takes a backseat to the set-pieces. Films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose. There are HUNDREDS of films that fit the bill... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones.It's an update of the movie that shares its name. It also shares that picture's ethos, but not quite it's execution. Whatever was great about the original has been streamlined. Whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget. Often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster - see the pug-ugly remake of The Italian Job for one that blew it - but here, thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors, Sixty succeeds.The plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write IMDb about. Often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors, each of whom will voice it with different inflections. A lot of people found this annoying; I find it raises a smile. Each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall leading the pack of course (and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see Mrs Pitt not given first billing here). The chemistry between good ol' Saint Nick the stalwart (see date of review) and Angelina leads to a couple of nice moments.The villain is not even a little scary - I've seen Chris Eccleston play tough-guy roles before so I know he can handle them, but I think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action. We know the heroes are going to succeed, somehow; we're just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the ride. I think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in-cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating. In fact, I wouldn't have minded some fourth-wall breaking winks at the camera: it's just that kind of movie.All this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not executed *just* so - would be worthless if the action wasn't there. And for the most part, it is. Wonderfully so. I've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast-cut extreme close-up shots to direct action these days. I personally find this kind of thing exhausting. I prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time. I've been told that Cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance (in real life I mean - his character clearly doesn't care) and it shows. The man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow-burning climatic finale where he drives a Mustang into the ground in the most outlandish - and FUN - way possible.So yes, this movie isn't an "epic, life-affirming post-9/11 picture with obligatory social commentary" effort. The pacing is uneven, some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line. But car movies rarely come better than this. So if you hate cars... why are you even reading these comments?!I'd take it over the numerous iterations of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" (guess the franchise) any day. 7/10

This one of those movies that just radiates cool. Nic Cage is at his best, the soundtrack is outstanding, and the premise is unique. All of the characters are well cast and badass. Gone in 60 seconds is just a good time.

To make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about Kip (Giovanni Ribsi), a car thief, who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars (50 in total). He is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the 'order'. The objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days, with the help of Randall (Nicolas Cage), a 'retired' booster and also Kip's brother and a couple of old friends of Randall's. As you can see this is the same old, big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course Randall is the best thief there ever was. Of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy about the story.OK the only downsides I felt while watching this movie was, that there is not very much action, there is one totally unrealistic scene, the story is only OK and that there are not much jokes. Hey but after seeing the whole film I must say: WHO CARES. Why must I say that, well because it was still entertaining; had a couple of cool car chases; good music; some Bruckheimer scenes (where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet); good actors who all did their jobs; pretty cars and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with. So some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie. All in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall OK movie with a cool - feelgood ending.As for Nicolas Cage, well He is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as The Rock, Con Air, Face / Off, Snake Eyes and finally this one. Plus what actor has had so many good action / thriller's in the last years and such successful ones ? Well no one!!! Maybe Jackie Chan, but he is one of my favourites too. One thing that is true though about Mr. Cages Bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse. The Rock, was a clear 9, Con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7. Not that that mark is bad. Does it not show that his films under Bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe Cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? No it doesn't show us that, because almost all of Cage's films were successful in the last few years, except for 8mm and Bringing out the Dead. 8mm was not great, I admit that, but that was never Cage's fault and the story seemed good to me. About the latter film I can not say anything, 'cause I have not seen it yet. One thing though I know for sure, if Bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films, I would have said YES to all of them. I would have said yes to The Rock, because the story was great and because you would get to play with Sean Connery and Ed Harris. I would have said yes to Con Air, because there would be a lot of action in it, because the story was good and because you got to act with John Malkovich and Ving Rhames. In this one I would have starred because I would have gotten a big paycheque, I would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because I would have been able to kiss Angelina Jolie (can't wait to see her in that Lara Croft outfit). This one was a good choice of Mr. Cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre.7 out of 10Note: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time. Apologies for any offence caused. I was young and stupid at the time, thinking I was being 'cool'.

Most of this movie, it seems, revolves around scenes in a garage where the lead actors tell the audience what they're going to do. The actual doing is then reduced to quick, almost montage-like scenes of the cars being stolen.The film is essentially a car chase (at the end) padded out with lots of mostly unimportant dialogue and scenes (the rest of the movie). As an example, the pace of the movie grinds to a halt when, having found the keys for three Mercedes cars they need, the dog swallows them. There's then an entirely unfunny set of scenes involving ex-lax and waiting for the dog to crap out the keys. All the while you keep hoping the movie will continue but it doesn't until the dog poops up the keys.The film is saved only by the final car chase, which rivals anything the Matrix series has provided, and which has the only half-way decent cinematic portrayal of what a compressed gas cylinder will do if the valve snaps off. Also a saving grace is Vinnie Jones - awful actor, but you can't help but like him anyway. His few scenes are worth looking out for.And that's about it for Gi60S. Mostly dull with a few spots of brightness and a good car chase at the end.

This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, Oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant "Bruck-buster" action at its best. Fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also, for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!

On the same topic as the '74 movie that raised public awareness about automobile security, this one is geared lot more for pure entertainment.Memphis (Nick Cage) is a retired car thief, but his past is hard to shake, and ends up being forced to collect a list of rare, and not so rare cars to be shipped over seas.All star cast, and all star cast of some of the most beautiful cars makes this movie an eye candy to watch. Not to mention comedic touch, and action of the story makes this an entertaining movie to watch.It's still one of the best car based movie ever made, and is a movie that's aged well over the years.

... calling it gone in 60 seconds. just imagine the stupid lines critics can use this title for. like : - I wish that I was gone out of the theater in 60 seconds. - exactly the time it takes to forget this film ,.....And the worst part of it is that itÂ´s true ! I went to see this because of all the car chases and crashes. Who didnÂ´t ? But.... nothing. I donÂ´t really want to talk about the plot or the characters because there simply is nothing of these things in the film. Cars are too expensive to crash and about 45 minutes nothing happens at all. And then ... the final chase. This is supposed to be the final chase in a car racing movie ? Every computer game is more exciting than this ! This film suffers from the M:I 2 Syndrome. Action movie with no action !-frightening !

A film that by the synopsis should appeal to all teens but it felt like the Writers forgot that, Apart from the ending there was literally no car chases and little action, The plot was ok but even though their task was near impossible they never felt like they were in any problems doing it, It had quite a big cast and they all did their best but I don't think they really needed Angelina Jolie as she offered nothing that was needed and wasn't even used for her sex appeal, The ending was pretty fun as it felt like they saved all their budget on it, With some good chases and a few ok stunts but as I said earlier it never felt like there was any danger in completing his mission and got very predictable, It's not a bad movie but it should of been so much more fun.

Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced out of retirement when he's forced to save his the life of his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) when he screws up on a job, by completing his brothers job of stealing 50 cars in one night. He has to get together his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it off and get his bro out of dutch. But the cops are onto him, so can he pull it off? This was one of the great candidates of a film to re-make as the Original was far from a classic. And if you don't go into it expecting much, and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is. You'll end up enjoying the ride. Watch it on a double-bill with "The Fast and the Furious" for a night of high-speed hijinks, just don't take the car out for a spin right afterwards.My Grade: B- DVD Extras: 7 minute Jerry Bruckheimer Interview; Bruckheimer Bio/Filmography; Action Overload: Highlight Reel; The Big Chase; "0 To 60" featurette; "Wild Rides" featurette; Stars On The Move; The Cult "Painted On The Heart" music video; Theatrical Trailer, and Trailers for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"

I admit that `Gone In 60 Seconds' is no `Gone With The Wind', but it does have some admiring qualities. This action-packed bubble-gum summer smash is about a former car thief who joins up with his old `stealers' team in order to do some quick car-jacking so his brother's life could be spared. Yes! It does include some of the idiotic theme plots that destroys action films: boring kidnappings, repetitious slogans, and lengthy chase scenes. These qualities should have been put on reverse in the editing room. However, what drove me crazy about the film is the chemistry or should i say gaseous substance between stars Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie. My eyes were tailgated on screen whenever they shared scenes together. `Gone In 60 seconds' is no autobahn, but it is definitely worth the ride.*** Average

I have mixed feelings about this movie. I do prefer movies that are a little more... intelligent per say, but I still feel Gone in Sixty Seconds is quite underrated. Actually, my biggest complaint is that the movie was too short. There was simply too much story and way to many characters to fit into the movie's time frame.The basic story is about a car thief, (Cage) who has achieved legendary status and then retired. His younger brother, trying to be like his brother, falls into car boosting too, but soon gets in too deep and ends up on the hit-list of a ruthless crime lord after he messes up a very important job. Now, the only way to save his brother's life is for Cage to come out of retirement and finish the job: Strealing fifty high profile cars in one night. Together with many other top thieves, they set out to do the impossible.While the cast is truly star studded, with big names such as Nicholas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Rober Duvall, most of the acting and characters aren't that sympathetic. The movie simply has too many characters to really get deeply into any of them. Delroy Lindo does a fairly engaging job as the old arch-nemesis of the protagonist, and Cage is good as usual, but the rest of the cast is nothing special, except perhaps for the mysterious coroner who never talks, Sphynx.But, the movie is still worth watching for the suspenseful action and the truly incredible chase scene at the end. Is there anything more beautiful then that Shelby Mustang GT, nicknamed Eleanor, roaring down the streets of Los Angoles? There are many other exotic cars in this movie too, from a very unique Hummer to a Lambourgini Diablo.Don't go into this movie expecting a deep and involving, dramatic story. While it does attempt at this, it doesn't necessarily succeed. But the action is suspenseful and although a tad unrealistic at times, it is a great kick to watch. This movie is better then the average action movie. A true classic for the car chase genre.My rating: **1/2 out of **** Other recommendations: Bourne Supremacy, The Italian Job (1969), Smokey and the Bandit

Really good film with a great cast which does help. I wouldn't say it's a must watch but definitely worth a watch.

This movie doesn't tell you any new truth or treat your refined taste with amazing characters.  It is just an old-fashioned chase movie of the good and the bad guys.  The circumstances and the grand theft of 50 cars over one night is of course out of this world but it doesn't matter because Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie charm us out of it.  After watching hundreds of car chase movies in my lifetime I didn't think yet another one would lighten my eyebrow.  I was wrong.  The smart and humorous execution of the car and car/helicopter chases was a great fun to watch; a good honest adrenalin booster.  Perhaps I am little generous but I give it 8/10 for all the fun.

I'm a huge fan of Cage. An even bigger fan of cars. And by my terms , the biggest fan of Jolie. Whaddayaknow! Gone in 60 seconds was one heck of a good movie. They have some awesome lines in this car thriller. To quote a few,"The cars are on the boat or your brothers in the coffin." "Metals cold , ugly. Woods warm provided by nature. Watching a piece of furniture take shape is like watching a child grow." "You have 60 seconds to consider your options. .................. ......................... be a big brother." "Then bring me his brother. One Raines is as good as the other. It never rains but it pours." .......and so many more. I understand that IMDb has a database of these quotes. But it was worth mentioning them cause that is what makes up this movie apart from cars. They have such awesome cars and lines, you wouldn't care about character development, really. Although, you must give it to Cage for having dug out an awesome performance for his character "Memphis" Raines. A thought for the soundtrack too: I fell in love with "The Cult" after I heard "Painted on my Heart" play swan song to a beautiful Lamborghini. I frankly don't understand why people are giving this movie a hard time ! What did they expect? An aria boosting 50 top end cars at the Sydney Opera House?

This review may contain some spoilers.The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds begins well.  Actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well.  But even a big Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable.  For those who don't know, the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors.  Who would suspect them.  But even with a change to nearly every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74 version that made it great.  The one in this version is watered down, only 10 minutes, and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase.  Where the original chase was very believable, the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt, the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes.  My advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase film, fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake.

The stage curtains open ..."Gone In 60 Seconds" finds Nicolas Cage at the peak of his career and in fine form. This was probably one of his better movies overall, and a personal favorite of mine. I watched it again last night and found to my surprise that it holds up very well and is just as entertaining today as when it was released nearly 20 years ago.When Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) bungles a car boost, his demanding gangster boss threatens to have him killed unless his older brother, Memphis (Cage), can steal 50 cars in the next three days for him. And not just any 50 cars, but a detailed list of some extremely hard to find classics. If Memphis can't meet the deadline, Kip is a dead man. Memphis has put all this behind him, but to save his brother, he rounds up his old buddies to help him do the impossible.This was such a fun movie to watch in the theater back in the day. I loved the use of colors in this one and it still looks really good on the big screen TV. This film finds all of it's actors in their prime - Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Will Patton and even throws in some veterans as well, like Robert Duvall and Frances Fisher. This is an engaging action fest that delivers what you come to expect from a movie like this. Car chases, jumps, explosions and well choreographed fights. And it has a good story to it as well.I love this movie - an action staple in my own collection. I highly recommend this to the action fan, and if you are a Nicolas Cage fan, I don't even have to tell you. I was always hoping they'd make a sequel to this one, but then a year later, the Fast & Furious franchise took over and that was that. 8 stars out of 10.

I haven't seen the original, so perhaps I should have before I spotted this. Had I not known something about it, the fact that 60 seconds isn't mentioned *once* in the film would have confused me.Car chase was OK, Jolie was gorgeous and Cage was passable.  That's about it really.  Not sure if it's worth bothering.  Nothing special.
