Ali G is undoubtedly an important character in terms of entertainment. He's a fictional gangster rapper, created and played by Sacha Baron Cohen and was used in short sketches in order to trick unwitting celebrities into giving interviews. And everything about the set-up worked, perfectly. However, when something is designed for 'small bursts' there's sometimes some problems when it's transferred to a full-length movie in terms of story. Here is an example of a film that just about pulls it off. Just.I quite enjoyed 'Ali G Indahouse,' but then I'm a big fan of the series (and I wasn't expecting too much!). However, I can't see the film attracting too many new converts, or really appealing to a wider audience. Gone are the clever interviews the character was known for, plus any real attempts at poking fun at popular culture or social commentary. Now, all that is replaced by a pretty generic story about Ali G trying to save his local youth centre by running for Parliament and getting used by political heavyweights in order to try and appeal to the youth of today.There's nothing particularly inspiring about the story and it's all wrapped up in plenty of pretty unsubtle 'toilet' humour (or at least that of the s3xual kind!). What was once a cutting attempt at poking fun of those too stupid or embarrassed to say what's literally staring them in the face has become one 'body-part' joke after the next.The supporting cast are there for Ali G to play off, including an underused Martin Freeman (before he was mega famous!) and acting greats Charles Dance and Michael Gambon (playing those dastardly 'suits' in power), but it's Sacha Baron Cohen's show all the way. He really does put his all into the role and certainly isn't afraid to send himself up, looking the fool at every given opportunity.And it's this kind of commitment that saves the film. Even as a fan of the original (sketch-based) creation of Ali G, I wasn't too sure about the full length film. Luckily, it's not too long and, although completely predictable, is certainly watchable enough if you're not offended by the language and subject material. It's definitely not 'high brow,' but I feel there should be a place for films which aren't supposed to tax you mentally after a day's work. Here, you can just put your brain on hold and smirk at the silliness on screen.I enjoyed it at the time and I still do today. However, I do feel that Cohen's future (big screen) releases were much 'sharper' in terms of taking a character developed for TV sketches and turning it into a feature-length movie. If you like Cohen's work, you should definitely check out his later offerings 'Borat' and 'Bruno.' Maybe 'Ali G Indahouse' was effectively Cohen honing his art? But, if you're still unsure as whether to watch or not, maybe just look up an old Ali G sketch on YouTube and, if you like it, you may just like the big screen version, too.

When most British TV comedies get given the big screen treatment they are usually terrible. This is one of the more successful attempts but is still no where near as funny as when Ali G was the telly. Ali G was hilarious on TV when he was interviewing unsuspecting politicians/scientists/vicars etc, and less so here in this cinematic adventure. It actually has a plot as Ali rises to become Primeminister of Great Britain! It has some very funny parts but not nearly enough of them, maybe its because Ali G has been around for about 3 years now and the concept is becoming a bit stale now. Although I loved the bit where Ali met Sacha's other comic creation "Borat", very clever and a nice pay off for fans of his TV show. ***6/10)***

'Ali G Indahouse' works primarily due to Sacha Baron Cohen's Terrific Performance. The actor is truly hilarious in here, as he manages to pull-off the non-sense stuff with great style. 'Ali G Indahouse' Synopsis: Ali G unwittingly becomes a pawn in the evil Chancellor's plot to overthrow the Prime Minister of Great Britain.'Ali G Indahouse' is funny in parts, not in totality. Some jokes & gags, especially in the first-hour, are excellent & bring the house down. But, in the second-hour, the writing material loosens & doesn't quite register an impact. Sacha Baron Cohen & Dan Mazer's Screenplay works in parts, while Mark Mylod's Direction is fair.Sacha Baron Cohen's performance as Alistair "Ali G" Graham, is terrific & deserves special mention. The talented actor who delivered fantastic performances in films like 'Borat' & 'Brüno', proves his mettle yet again. Here's an actor who deserves a massive fan-following, due to his sheer talent. I would love to see more of him. Another performance that I truly liked in here, was by Martin Freeman, who scores as Ali G's best friend. On the whole, 'Ali G Indahouse' is a fair comedy. Watch it for Sacha Baron Cohen!

I first encountered the Ali G character a few months ago in the American import of his interview show in which he sets up unsuspecting celebrities and creates comedy at their expense. Since they are invariably people who feed on public attention, it is entirely appropriate to feed on them once in a while. But it takes a seriously misleading, confusing and outrageous character to pull it off, and Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) does it. Cohen thinks funny; Ali G is a hugely funny creation, in much the same way that another wild and crazy guy, Andy Kaufman, invented unforgettably outrageous characters. "Ali G Indahouse" is Ali G to the third power, cubed. The plot is suitably improbable, offering an appropriate springboard for the Ali G craziness. I laughed till I cried. The plot twisted around and ended happily, and there wasn't a cliché that wasn't ragged on or a convention that wasn't exploited, and at every turn, the absurdity of the Ali G persona looms over all, ragging on itself and painting everything with its humor. I like the fact that Ali G is a white middle-class guy who has become a hip-hopper and gone native with it. In that way it's about re-creating oneself and then bumping up against conventional reality, which results in absurdities and humor, some attributable to the pretense of the invented persona and some to the ridiculous conventions it scrapes against. It could be a stretch and unfunny. It works and knocks 'em dead.Let me now back away from over-analyzing something that looks uncomplicated and isn't, but is hugely funny, and deserves just to be enjoyed. Roll with the humor of that crazy dude. He is a classic. Doug Wilson

I used to love Sacha Baron Cohen`s creation of Ali G on THE 11 0`CLOCK SHOW in the late 90s . I also liked the spin off show though it should be pointed out by then the joke was wearing thin and it was obvious his guests were in on the joke of having a white boy impersonating a black ghetto boy wannabe . When ALI G INDAHOUSE was released I didn`t bother to see it because Ali was probably past his sell by date then . But my brother bought me the video of this film and watched it on Boxing day and I must confess it was a lot better than I expected ALI G INDAHOUSE is a very funny if you understand the " Wigger " culture of middle class white boys wishing they were black . I was laughing out loud at the first half of the film as Ali lays down the facts to his posse that wearing the wrong colours in the ghetto could cost you your life , and Ali on the election trail had me in absolute stitches as he drove down Staines high street giving a rap broadcast , but then the film goes slightly downhill as an extremely unlikely political plot takes shape and the jokes slow down So all in all ALI G INDAHOUSE is funny but slightly uneven . I still watch the video a couple of months after getting it but only the first half . It`s a lot better than getting socks for Christmas so thanks for the video Neill

This is actually a quite lame comedy with some extremely childish humor but it all still somewhat works out due to the presence of the legendary Ali G character in it all.Even though this movie has basically nothing to do with the "Da Ali G Show" the character still works out as well in this movie. It's of course a ridicules and outrageous character but he's all the more hilarious because of it. It's obviously a satire on the whole rap and hip hop scene and it's still Sacha Baron Cohen most legendary character, despite the successes he has had with Borat and Brüno.The movie has some very childish humor, which mostly is about sex and it has an almost non-existent story. It's just the kind of movie in which the story really doesn't matter. It's all purely about the main character. Even the lamest and most predictable movie in this movie will still surely make you laugh a couple of times. "Ali G Indahouse" is not the most hilarious movie ever made or the best thing Sacha Baron Cohen has done in his life but it's good enough for a couple of dumb silly laughs. Still the movie gives you the feeling it has more misses than hits in it but jokes are bombarded at you so fast that you just tend to sort of forget the movie its weaker moments and enjoy the movie its more funny moments.Quite amazing actually that respected actors such as Michael Gambon and Charles Dance appeared in this type of movie. Or perhaps they knew of Ali G's success and just wanted to be a part of it. Still I feel that when looking back at it they won't regard this as their finest moment.Good enough for a couple of dumb laughs.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

If you are a fan of smooth, hip talking or just a bit of hip hop, then you'll like this film, as for everyone else, you can enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen as the great Ali G. Borat (Cohen) also appears, but his own film is much better. Basically, Ali G lives in the West Side of Staines and is protesting about his Leisure Centre closing down. So he decides to join the Prime Minister (Sir Michael Gambon) and his nasty assistant David Carlton (Charles Dance) in parliament, hence the title, Indahouse. Also starring Kellie Bright as "me" Julie, Martin Freeman as Ricky C, the fit Rhona Mitra as Kate Hedges, Tony Way as Dave, EastEnders' Nabil Elouhabi as Jezzy F and Ray Panthaki as Hassan B, Naomi Campbell, newsreader Jon Snow, EastEnders' Rudolph Walker as President Mwepu, and Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. Ali G was number 8 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, he was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments, along with Borat at number 24 (and Bruno at number 77), and he was number 6 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, with Borat at number 17, and Sacha Baron Cohen (or as the character) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian. Good!

Before there was Borat, there was Ali G.Released in 2002, "Ali G Indahouse" was the first of three films featuring the three characters from Sacha Baron Cohen's TV series, "Da Ali G Show"--the other two films being 2006's "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" and 2009's "Brüno." Unlike the latter two films, which used the unscripted man-on- the-street format of the TV show, "Ali G Indahouse" suffers from using a script.The story is mostly contrived. Alistair Leslie Graham, who goes by his wannabe name, Ali G, is a white kid from the London suburb of Staines who wants desperately to be black. He lives with his grandma and has a girlfriend he calls Me Julie. When the government threatens to close down the center where he teaches a group of boy scouts how to be gangstas (scenes of wasted comedic potential), Ali G goes on a hunger strike outside Parliament to protest. The hunger strike quickly ends when the reporters covering the event tempt him with some KFC. Ali G is then recruited by a conniving Member of Parliament, David Carlton, to run for the representative from Staines. Carlton's plan is for Ali G to fail miserably, embarrassing the Prime Minister (Michael Gambon, Dumbledore from all but the first two Harry Potter films), causing the PM to be ousted in a no-confidence vote, clearing the way for Carlton to become PM. Contrary to Carlton's plans, however, Ali G proves to be wildly popular by "keeping it real." The PM's approval rating soars, and Ali G becomes the PM's adviser. Of course Carlton isn't going to sit by idly while this happens.The movie falls back on lazy, juvenile humor. Most of the jokes are stillborn and fall flat. What made the TV show so wildly funny--playing off the character with interview subjects who weren't in on the joke--is completely absent from the movie. The movie does have some good moments, such as when Ali and the gang break into the PM's residence and have to break dance through an "Entrapment"-inspired security system criss- crossed with laser beams. And there is some funny commentary on modern society, such as when Ali has to clarify over the phone an indecipherable message he texted in shorthand.But without an unwitting victim, Ali G just isn't very funny. Luckily Cohen learned his lesson from this film, and stuck to the format that made his show so funny in the inspired comedy "Borat."

Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give it ten stars? Well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. And in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. Ali G's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on IMDb. But it could have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.On the whole, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. A great job! 9/10

Alistair Leslie Graham ("Ali G") is a young man from Staines, a small suburban town to the west of London. The central joke of the film is that Ali is white, British, middle-class and lives in a quiet part of suburbia but tries to imitate what he believes to be the lifestyle and culture of working-class urban blacks, although his idea of black culture is a curious mixture of American inner-city gangsterism and Caribbean Rastafarianism. Ali's fast-talking dialect is a mixture of Jamaican patois and London street slang; the character is said to be based upon the white disc jockey Tim Westwood, who affects a Caribbean accent despite being the son of the Anglican Bishop of Peterborough.Ali G, of course, is a creation of the British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, and existed well before this film was made, having appeared in various television programmes since 1998. (Another of Cohen's characters, the Kazakh journalist Borat, makes a brief appearance here). The format of "Ali G Indahouse" is different to that of Cohen's next film "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan". That film is a spoof document in which Cohen tries to persuade real-life members of the public that Borat is a real person. Although in the original television programmes Cohen had tried to persuade people that Ali too was a real individual, often in spoof interviews with celebrities, he obviously realised that by 2002 the character was too well-known for such a format to work. The film, therefore, is simply a fictitious story with Ali at the centre.Ali and his gang ("Da West Staines Massiv") get involved in a campaign to prevent the closure of a local leisure centre and as a result are dragged into a murky political intrigue by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to supplant the Prime Minister; this plot line may reflect the difficult relationship between the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Chancellor Gordon Brown, often seen as plotting against Blair. As a result of this intrigue Ali is elected to Parliament in a by-election; the word "Indahouse" in the title is a corruption of "In the house", the house in question being the House of Commons. After various vicissitudes all ends happily and Ali's beloved leisure centre is saved."Ali G Indahouse" is not quite in the same class as the ""Borat" film, in which Cohen had some serious points to make behind all the vulgarity and the madness. The idea was to express outrageous views in order to shock people or to trick them into agreeing with him, and thereby to expose levels of racism and prejudice in the United States. There is nothing quite of this nature in the "Ali G" film; despite the political send-ups it is not really making any serious points about British politics. The political plot, in fact, is not really important. The film is really an excuse for a display of Sacha Baron Cohen's brand of humour, which can be an acquired taste. As in the "Borat" film, the humour on display here is often vulgar, crude and offensive - and often hilarious. Ali talks a lot about "respect" (or "restecp" as he spells it), but he doesn't have a lot of restecp for anyone, certainly not for the powerful or the pretentious, and punctures their pretensions with a series of devastating put-downs. (Most of his one-liners, alas, are too crude to quote here).The film is not for anyone easily offended by sexual, scatological or drug references, or for anyone holding to high standards of political correctness. (Ali habitually refers to women, including his girlfriend "Me Julie" as "hos" or "bitches" and to homosexuals as "batty boys"). For anyone else, however, there is a lot to laugh at. 6/10

As a fan of "Da Ali G Show" on HBO, I had high hopes for this film. I should have known better when it went straight to video.... and then none of my local video stores carried it! The problem with this film is it simply tries too hard. I did not not want to see the Ali G character in his home environment or running for parliament or saving England. In my opinion, the "Ali G" character only works when he is operating OUTSIDE his environment --- so we can laugh at how unbelievably stupid he is and laugh even harder at the frustrated, often angry reaction his sincere stupidity arouses in all those unfortunate to encounter him. This movie bombs horribly due to the throwaway script, and as a result, it is an interminable exercise in sheer boredom with maybe 3-4 genuine laughs to be had in TOTAL. I well and truly HATED it from frame one and it just NEVER got any better (despite crossing my fingers and gritting my teeth). I think Sascha Baron Cohen has talent (his TV show proves it), but this movie shows absolutely NONE of that talent.

Ali G Indahouse has got to be one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and Cohen's portrayal of a British gangsta is hilarious. This film has cult classic written all over it, and it features some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good-time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. Definitely Vote Ali G and keep it real.

Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii! 7/10

Perhaps it hasn't dated well. I remember him being funny at the time but never got around to watching it. 18 years later, here I am, disappointed. Puerile.

STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsMovie adaptations of TV shows,books or magazines are rarely very good,but Ali G Indahouse is one of those pleasing exceptions to the rule.The set-up for the comedy has the local authority closing down the community centre where Ali works and him going on hunger strike outside the Houses of Parliament.When Prime Minister Michael Gambon decides he needs someone young and hip to gain a wider appeal to the activites of his party,Ali is just the man for the job.Ali introduces his 'Keep it Real' policy,to the anger of Charles Dance's dastardly right-hand man who's planning to build over Staines.The frank honesty of Sacha Baren Cohen's character and the clever satire enterwine beautifully together.Big up yourself and go see this movie.****

Bet Charles Dance has never in his career said anything remotely like: "Is there any reason why there should be an absurdly dressed half-naked man chained to a fence being tossed off by an old blind council worker?" The half-naked man is hip hop defender of the Westside Massive turf of Staines, west of London, Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen), chained to a government building on a hunger strike (which he has just broken by nibbling on a KFC chicken tender). A rival gang leader has taken advantage of him and pulled his pants down. Whereupon a blind council worker polishing the fence is also unknowingly polishing Ali's knob. If you haven't guessed yet, ALI G INDAHOUSE is not the type of girl you take home to mama.Buoyed by the success of his criminally funny DA ALI G SHOW (where Cohen perfected the art of catching people off guard with his naive, ambiguously-wigga Ali G, using their ignorance of his parodied character against them), Cohen ambitiously ramps Ali G into movie format. Which is a big up for Cohen, but not so formidable a career move for Ali G.ALI G INDAHOUSE works more often than it doesn't. The cultural gap is not so much to blame as the aura that Cohen has built around his fake celebrity hip hopster. We are used to seeing him blindsiding real life celebrities and officials, whereas here, too many people are in on the gag.That is, we know everyone Ali G interacts with is in concert creating a "comedy" - even those people who seem oblivious to his shtick, like the Prime Minister (Michael Gambon). The movie works best when Ali can riff without too much involvement with the other cast, ironically, his own ignorance creating the humor this time.Charles Dance is Deputy Prime Minister, David Carlton (aided by perfect-9 hardbody Rhona Mitra), who fixes Ali's election into Parliament, to be the Prime Minister's adviser on gaining the youth demographic, knowing full well Ali would embarrass the Prime Minister out of office, thereby setting the stage for him to be elected PM himself. His plan works all too well, when Ali's forthright stance on "keeping it real" only skyrockets the PM's popularity.Ali's girlfriend is "Me Julie" (Kellie Bright); his posse mate, Martin Freeman (best known from Ricky Gervais's THE OFFICE), who pulls off some fine jamming for a white boy.Drug gags, sex gags, scat gags, hip hop gags, gags that fall absolutely flat and gags that fly, ALI G INDAHOUSE is an uneven potpourri of throwing everything this character has against the wall and not caring whether it sticks or not; like a British version of POOTIE TANG (2001) - absurdist comedy about a street thug rising to prominence to battle the establishment.The message that politicians are either stupid or crooked is nothing new, and director Mark Mylod, with writers Cohen and Dan Mazer, traverse no new ground imparting that message, which Ali spells out quite literally: "R.E.S.T.E.C.P! Do ya even know wha it spellz? Yes, Restecp. 'How's anyone out there meant to restecp each other, if you lot in here, don't even start restecpa-ing one another?" Unfortunately, Ali's character does not remain the resolute, clueless renegade. It is disappointing that the film gives him a "respectable" arc - he is made Ambassador to Jamaica (the wicked pot being a bonus, of course) and goes from being a drug-addled misogynist to a Parliamentary drug-addled misogynist...Now that's Restecp.

A great film, surprisingly funny all the way through and certainly didn't flop like other British comedy slapstick films like 'Bean'.Worth a watch by anyone, for or against Ali G! Keep an open mind though.

Forget Will Ferrell and the Judd Apatow school of improv where actors get 5 and 6 goes at coming up with various punchlines in scenes (Ferrell usually makes his "hilarious" by yelling them out for no reason), try it unscripted and on the fly with a non-actor who may or may not punch you depending on their mood.To that end I fully recognise that Sacha Baron Cohen is an improv genius, Borat and Bruno both proved that beyond doubt. (He was also the funniest thing in Madagascar 1 or 2 by far.) But the first character to bring him notoriety was Ali G, the wannabe black gangster-pimp who is actually a middle class white boy from Britain.Perhaps it is because a lot of his comedy comes from shock value but I rarely choose to revisit the Bruno or Borat movies, they are far less cringe-worthy the second time round, and I was pretty surprised to find that this film had aged so poorly as I remembered it as a near classic.Not now Mr G.Aaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiight let's go.Ali G Indahouse opens with the best scene in the film, a dream sequence that sees Ali in his "natural habitat", the Los Angeles mean streets, surrounded by bitches and beset on all sides by hard core playas determined to do him harm. Of course he pulls out his gat (or equivalent) and busts many caps indeed.Cut to real life, Ali is actually a suburban dwelling gangsta-by-choice, with a similar posse of tossers (including Martin Freeman) in tow. They wear all yellow. Their nemesis gang is the East Staines Massive who wear blue and are equally (not) hard.When the local government closes down the local recreation centre Ali decides to protest to keep it open. Fortunately the Deputy Prime Minister (Charles Dance) sees an opportunity to submarine the Prime Minister's (Michael Gambon) standing and promptly announced that Ali G will be running for parliament in the local by-election.Ali's campaigning does not go well at all but a monumental gaffe in a televised debate by his opponent helps Ali become an unexpected success.Once in parliament the continually ludicrously dressed Ali and his similarly ridiculous boasting are taken as the voice of a generation and he promptly joins the cabinet and becomes the PM's go-to guy on all policy matters.After brokering a peace treaty by utilising tea laced with natural 'erbs Ali G is sacked, and the PM resigns when a tape of Ali boning his missus is released.Of course Ali must break into the new PM's office and fix tings.Maybe I'm ten years older and this just isn't as funny anymore, maybe it never really was. There are more chuckles in this than many other comedies, the recent Get him to the Greek and Date Night included, but no side-splitting moments of comedic brilliance.There is a funny sms joke near the end and Charles Dance proves himself to be a good sport, but without the "this is real" edge supplied by Borat and Bruno this seems a little too try-hard.I firmly believe though that Sacha Baron Cohen will make two or three truly brilliant comedies in years to come.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. It is telling that the two scenes with almost no relevance to the main plot are the funniest, that being the first 5 minutes and the last 5.

I have to admit that I love "Da Ali G Show" and purchased the first season as soon as it came out on DVD. So when I heard Sacha's movie was being released on DVD as well I wanted to rent it right away. One could say I had very high expectations as he is an extremely funny comedian so it was to my dismay that when it came time to actually watching the film it was complete and utter crap (for lack of a better term). I laughed probably 3-4 times tops throughout the whole duration which is pretty pathetic considering the main actor's potential. I mean I was well aware that it obviously didn't have a stellar budget but it still had so much more potential that it just couldn't live up to I guess. I was even more disappointed when I came to the realization that Mr. Cohen was actually one of the co-writers of this piece of garbage too because if he didn't help pen it then he could be considered less liable but once again to my chagrin...not in this case. I have seen a lot worse and I'm thinking I'm only being so hard on it since I went in with such high hopes but there are a handful of laughs, however don't act surprised when you find out it's nowhere near as funny as his TV show!Final Slant:Movies: I would've cried if I blew that much money on this!!DVD Purchase: I was tempted just to buy it first since I figured it'd be so good anyways...thank God I chose against this!Rental: Only if you're a big fan of Sacha's and can't get enough of him.

Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon). After this I will absolutely respect them even more, for having the good sense to take this chance. I have nothing really bad to say about this film, it's very funny. Very juvenile, but hey, so what?! One more thing to mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE!**** / *****

Simple and effective Baron Cohen revels in his environment, the ridiculousness is on full blast and it's absolutely hilarious. Despite the far fetched nature everything seems grounded and quite believable and the comedy lands completely. Not his best work but certainly a high standard

My god how bad this is. Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.This was obviously an attempt to get him known in the States before he released his show there on HBO.One commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums. While it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen Mr Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline. Instead we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with Ali G except for the packaging.Terribly disappointing. Go seek out the DVD's of Innit, Aiiii, or Bling Bling for some real Ali G.

As someone who usually despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching it, I was in a hysterical fit. Yes it is sexist, rude and extremely crude, and I loved it. As some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes, this movie was laugh-a-thon. I have never seen a comedy as original as Ali G Indahouse.For a comedy starring Ali G, this would be worthy of an 8 out 10. Absolutely Brilliant.

A bombshell is dropped on ALI G when he is told that the government want to close down the leisure centre where he teaches young kids. He decides that he is going to go on hunger strike until they change their plans. When that fails he gets an offer to enter politics, unknowingly to him, he has been asked by a person who desperately wants to become Priministor and has used Ali to try and ruin the real Priministor's reputation so that he will resign. However when Ali is a success he is stitched up by the person who entered him in the first place he decides to put it right.This film starred: Sacha Baron Cohen, Charles Dance & Martin Freeman.ALI G INDAHOUSE was released in 2002. In my opinion this is a good film that will make you laugh and entertain you for 90 minutes. I do recommend this film because it is a good comedy which will make you laugh and if it doesn't then you clearly have no sense of humour.***/***** Good film

Don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny. It was a complete disaster, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ali G is only funny on Channel 4's Ali G Show. After watching his performance, all i can say is He is not made for Movies. With a Daft script, or more like no storyline, there's nothing to keep you entertained. Full of annoying, unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way. At the end of the film, Ali G gives a speech. He mentions, if you hated this film, tell people it was good. Not even the speech could save the movie, He probably knew its gonna be a stinker. I would of given this a 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. Overall, Don't even waste your time on this rubbish.

Ali G is undoubtedly an important character in terms of entertainment. He's a fictional gangster rapper, created and played by Sacha Baron Cohen and was used in short sketches in order to trick unwitting celebrities into giving interviews. And everything about the set-up worked, perfectly. However, when something is designed for 'small bursts' there's sometimes some problems when it's transferred to a full-length movie in terms of story. Here is an example of a film that just about pulls it off. Just.I quite enjoyed 'Ali G Indahouse,' but then I'm a big fan of the series (and I wasn't expecting too much!). However, I can't see the film attracting too many new converts, or really appealing to a wider audience. Gone are the clever interviews the character was known for, plus any real attempts at poking fun at popular culture or social commentary. Now, all that is replaced by a pretty generic story about Ali G trying to save his local youth centre by running for Parliament and getting used by political heavyweights in order to try and appeal to the youth of today.There's nothing particularly inspiring about the story and it's all wrapped up in plenty of pretty unsubtle 'toilet' humour (or at least that of the s3xual kind!). What was once a cutting attempt at poking fun of those too stupid or embarrassed to say what's literally staring them in the face has become one 'body-part' joke after the next.The supporting cast are there for Ali G to play off, including an underused Martin Freeman (before he was mega famous!) and acting greats Charles Dance and Michael Gambon (playing those dastardly 'suits' in power), but it's Sacha Baron Cohen's show all the way. He really does put his all into the role and certainly isn't afraid to send himself up, looking the fool at every given opportunity.And it's this kind of commitment that saves the film. Even as a fan of the original (sketch-based) creation of Ali G, I wasn't too sure about the full length film. Luckily, it's not too long and, although completely predictable, is certainly watchable enough if you're not offended by the language and subject material. It's definitely not 'high brow,' but I feel there should be a place for films which aren't supposed to tax you mentally after a day's work. Here, you can just put your brain on hold and smirk at the silliness on screen.I enjoyed it at the time and I still do today. However, I do feel that Cohen's future (big screen) releases were much 'sharper' in terms of taking a character developed for TV sketches and turning it into a feature-length movie. If you like Cohen's work, you should definitely check out his later offerings 'Borat' and 'Bruno.' Maybe 'Ali G Indahouse' was effectively Cohen honing his art? But, if you're still unsure as whether to watch or not, maybe just look up an old Ali G sketch on YouTube and, if you like it, you may just like the big screen version, too.

When most British TV comedies get given the big screen treatment they are usually terrible. This is one of the more successful attempts but is still no where near as funny as when Ali G was the telly. Ali G was hilarious on TV when he was interviewing unsuspecting politicians/scientists/vicars etc, and less so here in this cinematic adventure. It actually has a plot as Ali rises to become Primeminister of Great Britain! It has some very funny parts but not nearly enough of them, maybe its because Ali G has been around for about 3 years now and the concept is becoming a bit stale now. Although I loved the bit where Ali met Sacha's other comic creation "Borat", very clever and a nice pay off for fans of his TV show. ***6/10)***

'Ali G Indahouse' works primarily due to Sacha Baron Cohen's Terrific Performance. The actor is truly hilarious in here, as he manages to pull-off the non-sense stuff with great style. 'Ali G Indahouse' Synopsis: Ali G unwittingly becomes a pawn in the evil Chancellor's plot to overthrow the Prime Minister of Great Britain.'Ali G Indahouse' is funny in parts, not in totality. Some jokes & gags, especially in the first-hour, are excellent & bring the house down. But, in the second-hour, the writing material loosens & doesn't quite register an impact. Sacha Baron Cohen & Dan Mazer's Screenplay works in parts, while Mark Mylod's Direction is fair.Sacha Baron Cohen's performance as Alistair "Ali G" Graham, is terrific & deserves special mention. The talented actor who delivered fantastic performances in films like 'Borat' & 'Brüno', proves his mettle yet again. Here's an actor who deserves a massive fan-following, due to his sheer talent. I would love to see more of him. Another performance that I truly liked in here, was by Martin Freeman, who scores as Ali G's best friend. On the whole, 'Ali G Indahouse' is a fair comedy. Watch it for Sacha Baron Cohen!

I first encountered the Ali G character a few months ago in the American import of his interview show in which he sets up unsuspecting celebrities and creates comedy at their expense. Since they are invariably people who feed on public attention, it is entirely appropriate to feed on them once in a while. But it takes a seriously misleading, confusing and outrageous character to pull it off, and Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) does it. Cohen thinks funny; Ali G is a hugely funny creation, in much the same way that another wild and crazy guy, Andy Kaufman, invented unforgettably outrageous characters. "Ali G Indahouse" is Ali G to the third power, cubed. The plot is suitably improbable, offering an appropriate springboard for the Ali G craziness. I laughed till I cried. The plot twisted around and ended happily, and there wasn't a cliché that wasn't ragged on or a convention that wasn't exploited, and at every turn, the absurdity of the Ali G persona looms over all, ragging on itself and painting everything with its humor. I like the fact that Ali G is a white middle-class guy who has become a hip-hopper and gone native with it. In that way it's about re-creating oneself and then bumping up against conventional reality, which results in absurdities and humor, some attributable to the pretense of the invented persona and some to the ridiculous conventions it scrapes against. It could be a stretch and unfunny. It works and knocks 'em dead.Let me now back away from over-analyzing something that looks uncomplicated and isn't, but is hugely funny, and deserves just to be enjoyed. Roll with the humor of that crazy dude. He is a classic. Doug Wilson

I used to love Sacha Baron Cohen`s creation of Ali G on THE 11 0`CLOCK SHOW in the late 90s . I also liked the spin off show though it should be pointed out by then the joke was wearing thin and it was obvious his guests were in on the joke of having a white boy impersonating a black ghetto boy wannabe . When ALI G INDAHOUSE was released I didn`t bother to see it because Ali was probably past his sell by date then . But my brother bought me the video of this film and watched it on Boxing day and I must confess it was a lot better than I expected ALI G INDAHOUSE is a very funny if you understand the " Wigger " culture of middle class white boys wishing they were black . I was laughing out loud at the first half of the film as Ali lays down the facts to his posse that wearing the wrong colours in the ghetto could cost you your life , and Ali on the election trail had me in absolute stitches as he drove down Staines high street giving a rap broadcast , but then the film goes slightly downhill as an extremely unlikely political plot takes shape and the jokes slow down So all in all ALI G INDAHOUSE is funny but slightly uneven . I still watch the video a couple of months after getting it but only the first half . It`s a lot better than getting socks for Christmas so thanks for the video Neill

This is actually a quite lame comedy with some extremely childish humor but it all still somewhat works out due to the presence of the legendary Ali G character in it all.Even though this movie has basically nothing to do with the "Da Ali G Show" the character still works out as well in this movie. It's of course a ridicules and outrageous character but he's all the more hilarious because of it. It's obviously a satire on the whole rap and hip hop scene and it's still Sacha Baron Cohen most legendary character, despite the successes he has had with Borat and Brüno.The movie has some very childish humor, which mostly is about sex and it has an almost non-existent story. It's just the kind of movie in which the story really doesn't matter. It's all purely about the main character. Even the lamest and most predictable movie in this movie will still surely make you laugh a couple of times. "Ali G Indahouse" is not the most hilarious movie ever made or the best thing Sacha Baron Cohen has done in his life but it's good enough for a couple of dumb silly laughs. Still the movie gives you the feeling it has more misses than hits in it but jokes are bombarded at you so fast that you just tend to sort of forget the movie its weaker moments and enjoy the movie its more funny moments.Quite amazing actually that respected actors such as Michael Gambon and Charles Dance appeared in this type of movie. Or perhaps they knew of Ali G's success and just wanted to be a part of it. Still I feel that when looking back at it they won't regard this as their finest moment.Good enough for a couple of dumb laughs.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

If you are a fan of smooth, hip talking or just a bit of hip hop, then you'll like this film, as for everyone else, you can enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen as the great Ali G. Borat (Cohen) also appears, but his own film is much better. Basically, Ali G lives in the West Side of Staines and is protesting about his Leisure Centre closing down. So he decides to join the Prime Minister (Sir Michael Gambon) and his nasty assistant David Carlton (Charles Dance) in parliament, hence the title, Indahouse. Also starring Kellie Bright as "me" Julie, Martin Freeman as Ricky C, the fit Rhona Mitra as Kate Hedges, Tony Way as Dave, EastEnders' Nabil Elouhabi as Jezzy F and Ray Panthaki as Hassan B, Naomi Campbell, newsreader Jon Snow, EastEnders' Rudolph Walker as President Mwepu, and Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. Ali G was number 8 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, he was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments, along with Borat at number 24 (and Bruno at number 77), and he was number 6 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, with Borat at number 17, and Sacha Baron Cohen (or as the character) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian. Good!

Before there was Borat, there was Ali G.Released in 2002, "Ali G Indahouse" was the first of three films featuring the three characters from Sacha Baron Cohen's TV series, "Da Ali G Show"--the other two films being 2006's "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" and 2009's "Brüno." Unlike the latter two films, which used the unscripted man-on- the-street format of the TV show, "Ali G Indahouse" suffers from using a script.The story is mostly contrived. Alistair Leslie Graham, who goes by his wannabe name, Ali G, is a white kid from the London suburb of Staines who wants desperately to be black. He lives with his grandma and has a girlfriend he calls Me Julie. When the government threatens to close down the center where he teaches a group of boy scouts how to be gangstas (scenes of wasted comedic potential), Ali G goes on a hunger strike outside Parliament to protest. The hunger strike quickly ends when the reporters covering the event tempt him with some KFC. Ali G is then recruited by a conniving Member of Parliament, David Carlton, to run for the representative from Staines. Carlton's plan is for Ali G to fail miserably, embarrassing the Prime Minister (Michael Gambon, Dumbledore from all but the first two Harry Potter films), causing the PM to be ousted in a no-confidence vote, clearing the way for Carlton to become PM. Contrary to Carlton's plans, however, Ali G proves to be wildly popular by "keeping it real." The PM's approval rating soars, and Ali G becomes the PM's adviser. Of course Carlton isn't going to sit by idly while this happens.The movie falls back on lazy, juvenile humor. Most of the jokes are stillborn and fall flat. What made the TV show so wildly funny--playing off the character with interview subjects who weren't in on the joke--is completely absent from the movie. The movie does have some good moments, such as when Ali and the gang break into the PM's residence and have to break dance through an "Entrapment"-inspired security system criss- crossed with laser beams. And there is some funny commentary on modern society, such as when Ali has to clarify over the phone an indecipherable message he texted in shorthand.But without an unwitting victim, Ali G just isn't very funny. Luckily Cohen learned his lesson from this film, and stuck to the format that made his show so funny in the inspired comedy "Borat."

Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give it ten stars? Well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. And in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. Ali G's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on IMDb. But it could have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.On the whole, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. A great job! 9/10

Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii! 7/10

As a fan of "Da Ali G Show" on HBO, I had high hopes for this film. I should have known better when it went straight to video.... and then none of my local video stores carried it! The problem with this film is it simply tries too hard. I did not not want to see the Ali G character in his home environment or running for parliament or saving England. In my opinion, the "Ali G" character only works when he is operating OUTSIDE his environment --- so we can laugh at how unbelievably stupid he is and laugh even harder at the frustrated, often angry reaction his sincere stupidity arouses in all those unfortunate to encounter him. This movie bombs horribly due to the throwaway script, and as a result, it is an interminable exercise in sheer boredom with maybe 3-4 genuine laughs to be had in TOTAL. I well and truly HATED it from frame one and it just NEVER got any better (despite crossing my fingers and gritting my teeth). I think Sascha Baron Cohen has talent (his TV show proves it), but this movie shows absolutely NONE of that talent.

Ali G Indahouse has got to be one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and Cohen's portrayal of a British gangsta is hilarious. This film has cult classic written all over it, and it features some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good-time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. Definitely Vote Ali G and keep it real.

Bet Charles Dance has never in his career said anything remotely like: "Is there any reason why there should be an absurdly dressed half-naked man chained to a fence being tossed off by an old blind council worker?" The half-naked man is hip hop defender of the Westside Massive turf of Staines, west of London, Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen), chained to a government building on a hunger strike (which he has just broken by nibbling on a KFC chicken tender). A rival gang leader has taken advantage of him and pulled his pants down. Whereupon a blind council worker polishing the fence is also unknowingly polishing Ali's knob. If you haven't guessed yet, ALI G INDAHOUSE is not the type of girl you take home to mama.Buoyed by the success of his criminally funny DA ALI G SHOW (where Cohen perfected the art of catching people off guard with his naive, ambiguously-wigga Ali G, using their ignorance of his parodied character against them), Cohen ambitiously ramps Ali G into movie format. Which is a big up for Cohen, but not so formidable a career move for Ali G.ALI G INDAHOUSE works more often than it doesn't. The cultural gap is not so much to blame as the aura that Cohen has built around his fake celebrity hip hopster. We are used to seeing him blindsiding real life celebrities and officials, whereas here, too many people are in on the gag.That is, we know everyone Ali G interacts with is in concert creating a "comedy" - even those people who seem oblivious to his shtick, like the Prime Minister (Michael Gambon). The movie works best when Ali can riff without too much involvement with the other cast, ironically, his own ignorance creating the humor this time.Charles Dance is Deputy Prime Minister, David Carlton (aided by perfect-9 hardbody Rhona Mitra), who fixes Ali's election into Parliament, to be the Prime Minister's adviser on gaining the youth demographic, knowing full well Ali would embarrass the Prime Minister out of office, thereby setting the stage for him to be elected PM himself. His plan works all too well, when Ali's forthright stance on "keeping it real" only skyrockets the PM's popularity.Ali's girlfriend is "Me Julie" (Kellie Bright); his posse mate, Martin Freeman (best known from Ricky Gervais's THE OFFICE), who pulls off some fine jamming for a white boy.Drug gags, sex gags, scat gags, hip hop gags, gags that fall absolutely flat and gags that fly, ALI G INDAHOUSE is an uneven potpourri of throwing everything this character has against the wall and not caring whether it sticks or not; like a British version of POOTIE TANG (2001) - absurdist comedy about a street thug rising to prominence to battle the establishment.The message that politicians are either stupid or crooked is nothing new, and director Mark Mylod, with writers Cohen and Dan Mazer, traverse no new ground imparting that message, which Ali spells out quite literally: "R.E.S.T.E.C.P! Do ya even know wha it spellz? Yes, Restecp. 'How's anyone out there meant to restecp each other, if you lot in here, don't even start restecpa-ing one another?" Unfortunately, Ali's character does not remain the resolute, clueless renegade. It is disappointing that the film gives him a "respectable" arc - he is made Ambassador to Jamaica (the wicked pot being a bonus, of course) and goes from being a drug-addled misogynist to a Parliamentary drug-addled misogynist...Now that's Restecp.

Perhaps it hasn't dated well. I remember him being funny at the time but never got around to watching it. 18 years later, here I am, disappointed. Puerile.

STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsMovie adaptations of TV shows,books or magazines are rarely very good,but Ali G Indahouse is one of those pleasing exceptions to the rule.The set-up for the comedy has the local authority closing down the community centre where Ali works and him going on hunger strike outside the Houses of Parliament.When Prime Minister Michael Gambon decides he needs someone young and hip to gain a wider appeal to the activites of his party,Ali is just the man for the job.Ali introduces his 'Keep it Real' policy,to the anger of Charles Dance's dastardly right-hand man who's planning to build over Staines.The frank honesty of Sacha Baren Cohen's character and the clever satire enterwine beautifully together.Big up yourself and go see this movie.****

Alistair Leslie Graham ("Ali G") is a young man from Staines, a small suburban town to the west of London. The central joke of the film is that Ali is white, British, middle-class and lives in a quiet part of suburbia but tries to imitate what he believes to be the lifestyle and culture of working-class urban blacks, although his idea of black culture is a curious mixture of American inner-city gangsterism and Caribbean Rastafarianism. Ali's fast-talking dialect is a mixture of Jamaican patois and London street slang; the character is said to be based upon the white disc jockey Tim Westwood, who affects a Caribbean accent despite being the son of the Anglican Bishop of Peterborough.Ali G, of course, is a creation of the British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, and existed well before this film was made, having appeared in various television programmes since 1998. (Another of Cohen's characters, the Kazakh journalist Borat, makes a brief appearance here). The format of "Ali G Indahouse" is different to that of Cohen's next film "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan". That film is a spoof document in which Cohen tries to persuade real-life members of the public that Borat is a real person. Although in the original television programmes Cohen had tried to persuade people that Ali too was a real individual, often in spoof interviews with celebrities, he obviously realised that by 2002 the character was too well-known for such a format to work. The film, therefore, is simply a fictitious story with Ali at the centre.Ali and his gang ("Da West Staines Massiv") get involved in a campaign to prevent the closure of a local leisure centre and as a result are dragged into a murky political intrigue by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to supplant the Prime Minister; this plot line may reflect the difficult relationship between the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Chancellor Gordon Brown, often seen as plotting against Blair. As a result of this intrigue Ali is elected to Parliament in a by-election; the word "Indahouse" in the title is a corruption of "In the house", the house in question being the House of Commons. After various vicissitudes all ends happily and Ali's beloved leisure centre is saved."Ali G Indahouse" is not quite in the same class as the ""Borat" film, in which Cohen had some serious points to make behind all the vulgarity and the madness. The idea was to express outrageous views in order to shock people or to trick them into agreeing with him, and thereby to expose levels of racism and prejudice in the United States. There is nothing quite of this nature in the "Ali G" film; despite the political send-ups it is not really making any serious points about British politics. The political plot, in fact, is not really important. The film is really an excuse for a display of Sacha Baron Cohen's brand of humour, which can be an acquired taste. As in the "Borat" film, the humour on display here is often vulgar, crude and offensive - and often hilarious. Ali talks a lot about "respect" (or "restecp" as he spells it), but he doesn't have a lot of restecp for anyone, certainly not for the powerful or the pretentious, and punctures their pretensions with a series of devastating put-downs. (Most of his one-liners, alas, are too crude to quote here).The film is not for anyone easily offended by sexual, scatological or drug references, or for anyone holding to high standards of political correctness. (Ali habitually refers to women, including his girlfriend "Me Julie" as "hos" or "bitches" and to homosexuals as "batty boys"). For anyone else, however, there is a lot to laugh at. 6/10

A great film, surprisingly funny all the way through and certainly didn't flop like other British comedy slapstick films like 'Bean'.Worth a watch by anyone, for or against Ali G! Keep an open mind though.

A bombshell is dropped on ALI G when he is told that the government want to close down the leisure centre where he teaches young kids. He decides that he is going to go on hunger strike until they change their plans. When that fails he gets an offer to enter politics, unknowingly to him, he has been asked by a person who desperately wants to become Priministor and has used Ali to try and ruin the real Priministor's reputation so that he will resign. However when Ali is a success he is stitched up by the person who entered him in the first place he decides to put it right.This film starred: Sacha Baron Cohen, Charles Dance & Martin Freeman.ALI G INDAHOUSE was released in 2002. In my opinion this is a good film that will make you laugh and entertain you for 90 minutes. I do recommend this film because it is a good comedy which will make you laugh and if it doesn't then you clearly have no sense of humour.***/***** Good film

I have to admit that I love "Da Ali G Show" and purchased the first season as soon as it came out on DVD. So when I heard Sacha's movie was being released on DVD as well I wanted to rent it right away. One could say I had very high expectations as he is an extremely funny comedian so it was to my dismay that when it came time to actually watching the film it was complete and utter crap (for lack of a better term). I laughed probably 3-4 times tops throughout the whole duration which is pretty pathetic considering the main actor's potential. I mean I was well aware that it obviously didn't have a stellar budget but it still had so much more potential that it just couldn't live up to I guess. I was even more disappointed when I came to the realization that Mr. Cohen was actually one of the co-writers of this piece of garbage too because if he didn't help pen it then he could be considered less liable but once again to my chagrin...not in this case. I have seen a lot worse and I'm thinking I'm only being so hard on it since I went in with such high hopes but there are a handful of laughs, however don't act surprised when you find out it's nowhere near as funny as his TV show!Final Slant:Movies: I would've cried if I blew that much money on this!!DVD Purchase: I was tempted just to buy it first since I figured it'd be so good anyways...thank God I chose against this!Rental: Only if you're a big fan of Sacha's and can't get enough of him.

Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon). After this I will absolutely respect them even more, for having the good sense to take this chance. I have nothing really bad to say about this film, it's very funny. Very juvenile, but hey, so what?! One more thing to mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE!**** / *****

Simple and effective Baron Cohen revels in his environment, the ridiculousness is on full blast and it's absolutely hilarious. Despite the far fetched nature everything seems grounded and quite believable and the comedy lands completely. Not his best work but certainly a high standard

My god how bad this is. Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.This was obviously an attempt to get him known in the States before he released his show there on HBO.One commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums. While it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen Mr Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline. Instead we have this mess, which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with Ali G except for the packaging.Terribly disappointing. Go seek out the DVD's of Innit, Aiiii, or Bling Bling for some real Ali G.

As someone who usually despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching it, I was in a hysterical fit. Yes it is sexist, rude and extremely crude, and I loved it. As some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes, this movie was laugh-a-thon. I have never seen a comedy as original as Ali G Indahouse.For a comedy starring Ali G, this would be worthy of an 8 out 10. Absolutely Brilliant.

Forget Will Ferrell and the Judd Apatow school of improv where actors get 5 and 6 goes at coming up with various punchlines in scenes (Ferrell usually makes his "hilarious" by yelling them out for no reason), try it unscripted and on the fly with a non-actor who may or may not punch you depending on their mood.To that end I fully recognise that Sacha Baron Cohen is an improv genius, Borat and Bruno both proved that beyond doubt. (He was also the funniest thing in Madagascar 1 or 2 by far.) But the first character to bring him notoriety was Ali G, the wannabe black gangster-pimp who is actually a middle class white boy from Britain.Perhaps it is because a lot of his comedy comes from shock value but I rarely choose to revisit the Bruno or Borat movies, they are far less cringe-worthy the second time round, and I was pretty surprised to find that this film had aged so poorly as I remembered it as a near classic.Not now Mr G.Aaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiight let's go.Ali G Indahouse opens with the best scene in the film, a dream sequence that sees Ali in his "natural habitat", the Los Angeles mean streets, surrounded by bitches and beset on all sides by hard core playas determined to do him harm. Of course he pulls out his gat (or equivalent) and busts many caps indeed.Cut to real life, Ali is actually a suburban dwelling gangsta-by-choice, with a similar posse of tossers (including Martin Freeman) in tow. They wear all yellow. Their nemesis gang is the East Staines Massive who wear blue and are equally (not) hard.When the local government closes down the local recreation centre Ali decides to protest to keep it open. Fortunately the Deputy Prime Minister (Charles Dance) sees an opportunity to submarine the Prime Minister's (Michael Gambon) standing and promptly announced that Ali G will be running for parliament in the local by-election.Ali's campaigning does not go well at all but a monumental gaffe in a televised debate by his opponent helps Ali become an unexpected success.Once in parliament the continually ludicrously dressed Ali and his similarly ridiculous boasting are taken as the voice of a generation and he promptly joins the cabinet and becomes the PM's go-to guy on all policy matters.After brokering a peace treaty by utilising tea laced with natural 'erbs Ali G is sacked, and the PM resigns when a tape of Ali boning his missus is released.Of course Ali must break into the new PM's office and fix tings.Maybe I'm ten years older and this just isn't as funny anymore, maybe it never really was. There are more chuckles in this than many other comedies, the recent Get him to the Greek and Date Night included, but no side-splitting moments of comedic brilliance.There is a funny sms joke near the end and Charles Dance proves himself to be a good sport, but without the "this is real" edge supplied by Borat and Bruno this seems a little too try-hard.I firmly believe though that Sacha Baron Cohen will make two or three truly brilliant comedies in years to come.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. It is telling that the two scenes with almost no relevance to the main plot are the funniest, that being the first 5 minutes and the last 5.

Don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny. It was a complete disaster, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ali G is only funny on Channel 4's Ali G Show. After watching his performance, all i can say is He is not made for Movies. With a Daft script, or more like no storyline, there's nothing to keep you entertained. Full of annoying, unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way. At the end of the film, Ali G gives a speech. He mentions, if you hated this film, tell people it was good. Not even the speech could save the movie, He probably knew its gonna be a stinker. I would of given this a 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. Overall, Don't even waste your time on this rubbish.
