Dick and Jane (Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni) were the very couple most people think about when they think "American." They were white, working, married with one kid, a dog, a BMW, and a house in the suburbs. Even their names were all-American. All they were missing was a picket fence. Their cookie cutter world came crashing down around them when Jane quit her job and Dick's company, Globodyne, went belly up. They were reduced to selling all of their worldly possessions, they even had to pay their child's nanny in small appliances.When the bank came after their house, they drew a line in the sand. They would liquidate no more. It was time to get criminal."Fun with Dick and Jane" was plenty funny. I never knew the word "indicted" could be so hilarious. I suppose that's what happens when a failing company slaps a VP label on a guy and puts him in front of a television audience to field questions about a bogus earnings report. Jim Carrey was gold and Tea Leoni held her own. It was definitely fun with Dick and Jane.

"Fun with Dick and Jane" reflects, in many ways, what's wrong with our society. We watch in disbelief as more and more CEOs are hauled up to jail and how these unscrupulous people leave their once valued employees to fend for themselves, as best they can.Dan Perisot directs this remake of the 1977 Jane Fonda-George Segal vehicle and brings it up to date. He counts with two actors that are popular to present this new installment in a funny way, Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni in the main roles.Poor Dick finds out in the worst way the job he held has just disappeared and must face reality. Dick and Jane must deal with their sudden status as they see their electricity cut, their housekeeper deserts them and Dick suffers the indignity of having to compete with other unemployed, former colleagues, for jobs that aren't half as glamorous as the vice-presidency he almost had.What's a desperate man to do? Well, being a resourceful man, he must do what he has to. Jane and Dick start a path into taking the law into their own hands. In a way, Mr. Carrey, one of the producers, mixes a serious problem with his kind of comedy. Jim Carrey is one of the best comedians working in movies today, but he also has an enormous talent for doing some serious dramatic work, as he has already proved. He is a dynamo in the film and turns the situation Dick is facing into fun, in his own way.Tea Leoni, is equally suited to play Jane, the travel agent who suddenly sees all those comforts she was used to, disappear, and must adapt to her new circumstances. Ms. Leoni and Mr. Carrey do some funny things together, making the film look much better than what could have been. The supporting players, mainly Alec Baldwin and Richard Jenkins make good contributions to the film."Fun with Dick and Jane" is a typical example of those holiday themed films the studios love to unload at the end of the year.

Well, was this the best Jim Carrey comedy? Not really, but it is one of his better late one's. I think because I have had the week from heck, I just needed a good laugh, thanks to Jim. :) Anywho, Dick and Jane are two average Americans who follow by the rules and manage a reasonable budget. When the company that Dick owns goes broke, he is fired, he and Jane are now in trouble when Dick cannot find a job fast enough. Piece by piece they are loosing or having to sell their stuff, when Dick receives an eviction notice, he and Jane have had it and will no longer play by the rules to live their lives once again. With a cast who seemed to enjoy making the film, I think this was over all a funny movie to watch and would recommend it.7/10

FUN WITH DICK AND JANE (2005) ** Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni, Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins.Toothless satire remake of a largely forgotten comedy.Why does Hollywood continue to remake films that are in no way clamoring to be remade? In the latest 're-imagining' of a 'comedy' from the '70s that never registered to begin with the original FUN WITH DICK AND JANE with George Segal and Jane Fonda, I must admit do not remember at all. I was maybe ten when if first came out and when it premiered on cable most of it was over my head for a sophisticated farce about a middle-class couple facing life on another viewing when the corporate ladder hubby has been scaling shakes him free from his ascent to financial security.In the toothless 21st century attempt to shock the system, Dick Harper (sadly underused Carrey) is a VP wannabe of an Enron-like conglomerate that is on the verge of financial ruin and federal indictments aplenty when its CEO Jack McCallister (a slimily bearded Baldwin) absconds with its pension plans for his own personal gains while alighting on the company helicopter as Dick has been publicly humiliated as the investors' patsy. Dick's downward spiral continues as his wife Jane (Leoni, ditto) attempts to maneuver their lateral positions for the best even if it means paying their housekeeper in appliances when the money run out.What could have been a clever skewering of the '00s blight of corporate thievery and deceit comes across as a slap-happy sitcom sized rejoinder to the rat race with the indisposed couple resorting to stick-up jobs at the local mini- mart and eventually all paths leading back to the man responsible for their plight.Carrey and Leoni make the most of their slight screenplay (by Judd Apatow, Nicholas Stoller and Peter Tolan) and the ham-fisted direction by Dean Parisot but ultimately the story is rather beleaguered and the send-off ending feels tacked on.Too bad the comedy that could've been - sticking it to THE MAN - never comes to fruition.

Jim Carrey does it again. Slapstick comedy but not the pie throwing variety. it's a lot more subtle than the Ace Ventura movies but it's no dark comedy either.The movie is an extremely exaggerated view of Dick, Jane and kid coping with loss of job, income, car, nanny, TV, grass (the lawn type not the other grass), electricity, and even citizenship. Suspend your logic and have fun. There are escapes, car crashes, robberies, illegal immigrants, job hunts, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Bush ... if this doesn't perk your interest nothing will.The best gag in the film is at the end just before the titles start... don't miss the "Our Special Thanks To" part!

I have never seen the original FUN WITH DICK AND JANE (with George Segal and Jane Fonda) so I can't do many comparisons with this remake. However I saw it since Jim Carrey always had been one of my favourite actors of all time (both in comedy and drama) and I was also shocked at the score of 6,1 since I had a fine time watching it.Dick Harper (Jim Carrey) and his wife Jane (Tea Leoni) are married, with a child and they seem to have a perfect life. However, after a series of scams they lose their own jobs, their lives change drastically. At first they are in crisis and desperate in their search for new jobs. But after a while they discover that stealing things from the richer ones is kinda funny and they turn into a life of crime without ever being captured.Having never seen the original I can't understand why many people are negative towards this movie. Perhaps is because this remake at times is a bit heavy handed (and I can understand that) but I am sure that also the original was a bit depressing especially when Dick and Jane lost their jobs. The leads (Carrey and Leoni) are in top form and they have lots of chemistry together.
Also Alec Baldwin is very hilarious at times in his supporting role.However what I should say more? Just turn off your brain and enjoy this comedy for what it is even if you, like me, never saw the 1977 original.

I didn't find the 1977 version of "Fun With Dick and Jane" all that memorable, and this remake is about on a par with the original. Those who go for Jim Carrey's brand of humor will probably like it, and in a few instances I have to admit, his antics did make me chuckle. Most notable was that scene where he was dressed all in black with a mask and going bonkers on Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin). His gyrations were just so goofy you had to laugh. Pairing him up with TÃ©a Leoni wasn't a bad idea as their chemistry for this kind of picture worked. That makeup job when her face got distorted was kind of hideous though, I'm surprised she agreed to the mutilation. The story seems to be a back handed homage of sorts to all the corporate executives who mined their companies for all they were worth before the final nail was drilled into their coffins. Take note of the screen crawl just before the credits roll and you'll see what I mean.When I first watched and reviewed the earlier picture with George Segal and Jane Fonda in the lead roles, I made mention of the fact that the movie's captioning X'ed out the name 'Dick' whenever it was uttered on screen, obviously to draw attention away from it's inelegant description of a part of the male anatomy. Since anything goes today in movies and TV, no such censorship took place with this film, but that effort in the first place only drew more awareness to it in my estimation. And once again, I couldn't help thinking of a married couple that are friends of mine with the names Dick and Jane, who I kept envisioning through all the nonsense and shenanigans that Carrey and Leoni went through to get their revenge on the head of Globodyne. Fortunately, they never robbed so much as a gas station.

What a terrible misfire. Not only the title but the idea is the same as that Jane Fonda, George Segal vehicle of a few decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with the clout of Jim Carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. He could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. Money, money, grosses, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. I call it uncomfortable because that's how I felt. Aware as I was of the desperate attempts tried out on the screen to be funny. And failing, miserably. It could have been an outrageous, politically incorrect, mirror comedy of the post Enron days but no, that would be pointing too high, too risky. What a shame!

I think the reason why this film wasn't so well-received was because of its serious theme as people expected it to be an out-and-out comedy. However, I think it touches on some very relevant issues, especially today when the economy is at a recession where people are losing their jobs, their houses and slowly everything they own. But coming, back to the comedy element, there's plenty of that and a lot to laugh about so I still don't understand all the negativity towards this fun movie. For me the funniest sequence was the swollen mouth sequence. Carrey and Leoni are awesome together. They make a great comedic pair on screen. Richard Jenkins is terrific too and Alec Baldwin isn't bad either. I haven't watched the original version but I saw an interview of Jim Carrey where he mentions that the movie is more relevant today than it was in 1977. I couldn't agree more.

I saw this funny movie last Friday and I really have enjoyed this picture. I laugh a lot, and Jim Carrey uses one of the forgotten comedy techniques: the physical humor. Jim is a wonderful and versatile actors nowadays, he can be the funniest man in movies like this one or Ace Ventura (when he takes his humor to the limit), have an excellent contained comedy (as Eternal sunshine of the Spotlees Mind) or a surprising dramatic actor (Thruman Show or Man in the Moon). This movie touches a very sensible theme: empresarial corruption, a subject that, get lost with the comedy and doesn't leave something for being analyzed after the movie. Tea is not a great actress (as a matter of facts, in my opinion she spoils Spanglish) and Renee Zellweger or Reese Whiterspoon could have done a better role.

Jim Carrey has been funnier in other films, but still, something about this one hit the right spot for me. I wouldn't recommend full price admission at the theater, but a matinÃ©e is not a total waste on this movie.As usual Alec Baldwin puts in a trooper supporting role as the slimy CEO of the company that puts the screws to Carrey's character. There is enough fun stuff here to gloss over some of the big holes and "could have been's".Definitely could do worse this holiday season. As I mentioned in the summary, not one of Jim's best, but not close to his worse.

This movie has a good mix of typical Jim Carey humor with some modern day adult issues that many Americans can relate to. There is plenty of serious points in the movie to suggest the director wanted to reach adult audiences more-so than a younger crowd who can not identify much of the issues brought fourth in the movie. Tei and Jim are a great pair, and play their parts splendidly. The setting is such that they could be living and working in any major suburb across the US. The plot is very real to anyone that has worked for a big company and has moved up the corporate ladder. The fears, and concerns that develop as the plot progresses 'feels' very natural and lifelike. A+ Job done on this movie buy cast and crew.

Oh my lord, what were they thinking about with this one. It not only is frantically unfunny, but worse, a very good original was trashed in the bargain. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, actually turned in the performance of her life in that one. Even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life. Maybe she is just flat good as a crook. Any other time, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal team up beautifully, so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby, catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from.Because very very very little of that one remains, to this ones horror. Nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when Dick and Jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss..... and uhh........oh my lord, that's it? Well, looks like it. It truly is that bad a film.

Jim Carrey is hard to beat in a role like this. He looks like the all American yuppie - tall, clean shaven, well dressed, and in control of his life - and his comedic delivery has been refined into a polished riff. All is believable when he lets loose because you know this is a guy who has a great sense of humor and he can get you to laugh until you lose your breath without grossing you out or making you groan at absurd silliness. Even while prancing or jabbing the air or contorting his face, Carrey is - hands down - the sexiest comedian on screen today. Tea Leoni is a good match for him because she too can be sexy while doing pratfalls or ending up with mud on her face. This is a dream coupling that should be repeated in more light comedies the way William Powell & Myrna Loy were paired in The Thin Man series.I found this remake head and shoulders above the original because it had far more energy and there was more 'sympatico' in the match of personalities of Dick & Jane. The new version also has a much more important message about corporate shenanigans and its grave impact on modern society. The film moves at a quick pace and was too short for me, but that's only because I didn't want to leave these characters. They became that fun couple you always invite to your get-togethers because they are the life of every party.

22 January 2006. Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni, and director Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest and Home Fries), had a difficult movie to carry with the idea of a comedy about nice people turning to crime after a corporate executive takes off with its money. Yet besides a little uneven pacing and a few awkward moments in transition, the comedy team pulls it off including a few brief flashes of emotional drama that Jim is capable of. This mostly entertaining and sensitively handled comedy with elements of drama managed to skirt over the land mines and bombs that this movie had to negotiate through to pull off a movie without offending or losing its audience emotionally or sympathy. The plot is thought threw with relative taste in the descent and decline into poverty with turning into a drama. Oftentimes a comedy can easily transition into a drama that by the end ends up turning off everybody. In this movie, the script manages to turn things around (sometimes barely) and keeps its characters above water comically speaking while still retaining its substantive drama, the small amount there is. Jim continues his balance tight rope walk between his over the top comedic antics, a more sophisticated, subtle humorous performance, and his dramatic abilities - not completely without stumbling at times. Overall, this movie succeeds to the end in providing the audience with a comedy entertainment that was its intention while providing some semblance of serious commentary about corporate greed and the plight of the impoverished. Seven out of Ten Stars.

Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he's a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example).However, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has NOTHING else to recommend it.Even if you do like Carrey's comedy, I am not sure you will find this film amusing. I went to see it on a Saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. They giggled throughout the trailers, which weren't particularly funny, but when it came to the film, stony silence. I think it raised about five genuine laughs.The problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. It can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious. If it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but (I'm guessing) it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters.The strong point of the film is the hold-ups, and there was plenty of potential here. But these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. Meanwhile, you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates.Four separate groups walked out of this film while I was there, and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house (his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation!), I would have done the same. And in my entire 25 years of movie going, I have done that just once before.

Have we lost our humor in America? This is a very funny movie. In many ways it's a dark comedy with a happy ending. But it moves quickly, is a parody on timely issues and has some of the best physical acting you'll ever see.Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni work very well together. And while the 1977 original had two of my favorite people (whacko politics aside for Jane Fonda because she was a hoot in Barbarella), I think this version was more light hearted and more up to date.I have a strange feeling that younger people didn't understand the concept, 20-30's thought it implausible for them and people above were frightened by its premise.7 out of 10 for an entertaining time.

Dick and Jane (Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni) were the very couple most people think about when they think "American." They were white, working, married with one kid, a dog, a BMW, and a house in the suburbs. Even their names were all-American. All they were missing was a picket fence. Their cookie cutter world came crashing down around them when Jane quit her job and Dick's company, Globodyne, went belly up. They were reduced to selling all of their worldly possessions, they even had to pay their child's nanny in small appliances.When the bank came after their house, they drew a line in the sand. They would liquidate no more. It was time to get criminal."Fun with Dick and Jane" was plenty funny. I never knew the word "indicted" could be so hilarious. I suppose that's what happens when a failing company slaps a VP label on a guy and puts him in front of a television audience to field questions about a bogus earnings report. Jim Carrey was gold and Tea Leoni held her own. It was definitely fun with Dick and Jane.

In previews and early reviews this movie was called "one of the funniest movies ever" and I was eager to see it. But after a while it began to get called "the worst Jim Carrey movie ever". I still thought I should see it, being a big Jim Carrey fan, plus I haven't always agreed with the critics. After seeing it I can't say it's the funniest movie ever, but it definitely isn't the worst.I have not seen the original version, but I'm sure there are some modern plot twists and of course original jokes. There are plenty of gags and funny situations that kept me entertained throughout and some really good ones that made me laugh hysterically. Many comedies are very silly which makes them so funny, but people have said that this movie is just silly and not funny at all, I can't agree. While there are some small parts that are just silly, the rest are not.Acting wise it is quite good. Jim Carrey does his trademark craziness well in this one. The rest of the cast do well too.Overall it's a funny, entertaining movie. If you feel like a light comedy with some good laughs, ignore the harsh critics and go and see it.

This is the story of Dick, an ambitious marketing executive which is promoted to the top just on the day his corporation implodes due to some embezzlement scheme. The first 15 minutes (Dick's ascent) are really very, very funny - that's Jim Carrey at his best.The movie's best part is when you see Dick and his wife falling all the way to level where survival is really a struggle - this is actually very moving. Their ensuing blotched criminal career is on the other hand not so funny as you might expect -- you have the feeling that this is a very good serious movie trying to be funny just to meet the public's expectations.

A wildly underrated remake of the Jane Fonda/George Segal classic --- proving that it's never a bad time to say f### y## to corporate America. Jim Carrey & Tea Leoni find themselves way over their heads after Carrey is run out of his job by greedy boss Alec Baldwin. They plot revenge after trying (in the most bizarre ways imaginable)to make ends meet. Attempting everything from bank robbery to migrant day labor, Carrey is brilliant and Leoni is a perfect match for his hyperactivity. Their Sonny & Cher bit is lunacy and Carrey's run in with some ruthless INS officers has to be seen to be believed. Baldwin, affecting a southern drawl, is suitably nasty and the supporting cast includes Michael Higgins, Angie Harmon, and Richard Jenkins, as the couple's boozy and very unlikely savior.

Jim Carrey has come a long way since his early days on In Living Color. He became a hit actor in the likes of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (a personal childhood favourite), The Mask and Dumb and Dumber. He tried hard for an Oscar nom, but always contended with winning Golden Globes. And for years now, he has basically been bouncing around dramas, comedies, and dramedies. So now, he has tackled a remake (of a comedy no less), and the results as per the last few years, are mixed at best.Carrey is Dick, an employee at Globodyne (read: Enron) who is promoted just in time to help sail the company into oblivion on television. He tells his wife Jane (Tea Leoni) to leave her job only hours before hand, and upon returning stunning home, realizes that he may be in a bit of trouble. As the months go on, the pair's assets slowly begin to dwindle, and hope for continued survival begins to evaporate. So with nothing left to do, they turn to life of petty crime and hope for the best.It is not an original concept at all, but Carrey and Leoni do a valiant job keeping this boat floating. While the film does have a few hilarious moments, the rest of it is bogged down by mere snicker-filled sequences or just scenes that are totally unfunny. It's not like these two actors are having any trouble being funny, it's that the material is not funny. Judd Apatow did wonders with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, but he fumbles here pretty hard with his writing partner Nicholas Stoller, who does not have nearly enough credits to his name. A parody on what happened at Enron was inevitable, but this just seems lackluster and barely thought out. Subplots are brought in, but barely resolved, and the key storyline just feels very weak by the end. It's not terrible, it just feels a tad bit incomplete.The sorry thing about the entire film is the fact that much of it just feels like an extended montage with little payoff. It is only ninety minutes long, so it feels like a lot was trimmed down or cut right out. But the film suffers as a result. If it was longer, it undoubtedly could have had more potential for more funny moments, and as a whole, feel more complete.While Carrey and Leoni do their best, it's Leoni who gives a stronger performance. Yes, Carrey is right at home with his zany character, and totally overshadows Leoni in every single aspect. But he just lacks that integral element of human comedy here, that made him so famous in the first place. It's unfortunate, and makes me wonder if the old Carrey will ever return, or if we'll have to contend with semi-funny Carrey for the rest of his career. Leoni is much better, and feels more in tune with what she's doing. Even more unfortunate is the wasted supporting cast does very little. Alec Baldwin as the sleazy CEO Jack McCallister is sparingly unfunny, as is Richard Jenkins as the right hand man Frank Bascombe, who spends most of the movie drunk and not doing anything (besides setting up for the finale). The rest of the cast has little to no screen time, or are simply silly supporting characters that just feel like excess waste in the entire scheme of things.For all of it's faults, the film is a worth while watch. As said, I did laugh at some of it. A bit of work on the screenplay would have benefited everyone here. Just do not go in expecting a comedy classic with Jim Carrey. If so, you will be sadly disappointed.6.5/10.

Well, was this the best Jim Carrey comedy? Not really, but it is one of his better late one's. I think because I have had the week from heck, I just needed a good laugh, thanks to Jim. :) Anywho, Dick and Jane are two average Americans who follow by the rules and manage a reasonable budget. When the company that Dick owns goes broke, he is fired, he and Jane are now in trouble when Dick cannot find a job fast enough. Piece by piece they are loosing or having to sell their stuff, when Dick receives an eviction notice, he and Jane have had it and will no longer play by the rules to live their lives once again. With a cast who seemed to enjoy making the film, I think this was over all a funny movie to watch and would recommend it.7/10

Dick and Jane is a comedy I didn't expect to do very well. I wasn't sold by the trailers, and another remake is something the world can live happily without. Dick and Jane is an underrated hit though, and Carrey and Leoni are remarkably not as annoying as they sometimes can be. Carrey is, thankfully, as hyperbolic as the character of Dick will let him be and Jane isn't as complicated a role for Leoni to fall on. The movie excellently thanks corporations for its inspiration in the final credits.Dick has a happy, healthy upper-middle class family. A promotion to the upper echelon believes him to convince his wife Jane to quit her job and get that hot tub they always wanted. A sudden change in corporate direction however, changes their future as they must resort to drastic measures when the bills aren't getting paid.I didn't find myself laughing as much as I wanted to for a movie. In a year dominated by comedy-remake stinkers like the Honeymooners and Bewitched, Dick and Jane is one of the better movies of the year to watch. If you want a good movie to watch and understand a little bit of corporate history, I recommend Dick and Jane for you.

Take note of the screen crawl just before the credits roll and you'll see what I mean.When I first watched and reviewed the earlier picture with George Segal and Jane Fonda in the lead roles, I made mention of the fact that the movie's captioning X'ed out the name 'Dick' whenever it was uttered on screen, obviously to draw attention away from it's inelegant description of a part of the male anatomy. Since anything goes today in movies and TV, no such censorship took place with this film, but that effort in the first place only drew more awareness to it in my estimation. And once again, I couldn't help thinking of a married couple that are friends of mine with the names Dick and Jane, who I kept envisioning through all the nonsense and shenanigans that Carrey and Leoni went through to get their revenge on the head of Globodyne. Fortunately, they never robbed so much as a gas station.

What a terrible misfire. Not only the title but the idea is the same as that Jane Fonda, George Segal vehicle of a few decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with the clout of Jim Carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. He could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. Money, money, grosses, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. I call it uncomfortable because that's how I felt. Aware as I was of the desperate attempts tried out on the screen to be funny. And failing, miserably. It could have been an outrageous, politically incorrect, mirror comedy of the post Enron days but no, that would be pointing too high, too risky. What a shame!

I think the reason why this film wasn't so well-received was because of its serious theme as people expected it to be an out-and-out comedy. However, I think it touches on some very relevant issues, especially today when the economy is at a recession where people are losing their jobs, their houses and slowly everything they own. But coming, back to the comedy element, there's plenty of that and a lot to laugh about so I still don't understand all the negativity towards this fun movie. For me the funniest sequence was the swollen mouth sequence. Carrey and Leoni are awesome together. They make a great comedic pair on screen. Richard Jenkins is terrific too and Alec Baldwin isn't bad either. I haven't watched the original version but I saw an interview of Jim Carrey where he mentions that the movie is more relevant today than it was in 1977. I couldn't agree more.

Seen this a few times, nothing out of the ordinary but entertaining nevertheless. Just realized recently that the screenplay was part-written by Judd Apatow (with Nicholas Stoller). The cast is great with Carrey, Leoni & Baldwin. If you're in the mood for some uncomplicated laughs, this is the film for you.

I saw this funny movie last Friday and I really have enjoyed this picture. I laugh a lot, and Jim Carrey uses one of the forgotten comedy techniques: the physical humor. Jim is a wonderful and versatile actors nowadays, he can be the funniest man in movies like this one or Ace Ventura (when he takes his humor to the limit), have an excellent contained comedy (as Eternal sunshine of the Spotlees Mind) or a surprising dramatic actor (Thruman Show or Man in the Moon). This movie touches a very sensible theme: empresarial corruption, a subject that, get lost with the comedy and doesn't leave something for being analyzed after the movie. Tea is not a great actress (as a matter of facts, in my opinion she spoils Spanglish) and Renee Zellweger or Reese Whiterspoon could have done a better role.

Jim Carrey has been funnier in other films, but still, something about this one hit the right spot for me. I wouldn't recommend full price admission at the theater, but a matinÃ©e is not a total waste on this movie.As usual Alec Baldwin puts in a trooper supporting role as the slimy CEO of the company that puts the screws to Carrey's character. There is enough fun stuff here to gloss over some of the big holes and "could have been's".Definitely could do worse this holiday season. As I mentioned in the summary, not one of Jim's best, but not close to his worse.

This movie has a good mix of typical Jim Carey humor with some modern day adult issues that many Americans can relate to. There is plenty of serious points in the movie to suggest the director wanted to reach adult audiences more-so than a younger crowd who can not identify much of the issues brought fourth in the movie. Tei and Jim are a great pair, and play their parts splendidly. The setting is such that they could be living and working in any major suburb across the US. The plot is very real to anyone that has worked for a big company and has moved up the corporate ladder. The fears, and concerns that develop as the plot progresses 'feels' very natural and lifelike. A+ Job done on this movie buy cast and crew.

A satire about greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. Jim Carrey's reign was certainly short lived. He is an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. He produced this, this "masterpiece" as well, so he can't blame anyone here. "The number one comedy in America" shout the desperate TV adds. Of course, Jim Carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over. If I sound angry is because I am. I spent a sunny afternoon in California, plus, between tickets, parking, flat Cokes etc, almost 45 bucks on this thing, starring and produced by Mr Carry. Not anymore, do you hear? Not anymore.

22 January 2006. Jim Carrey, Tea Leoni, and director Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest and Home Fries), had a difficult movie to carry with the idea of a comedy about nice people turning to crime after a corporate executive takes off with its money. Yet besides a little uneven pacing and a few awkward moments in transition, the comedy team pulls it off including a few brief flashes of emotional drama that Jim is capable of. This mostly entertaining and sensitively handled comedy with elements of drama managed to skirt over the land mines and bombs that this movie had to negotiate through to pull off a movie without offending or losing its audience emotionally or sympathy. The plot is thought threw with relative taste in the descent and decline into poverty with turning into a drama. Oftentimes a comedy can easily transition into a drama that by the end ends up turning off everybody. In this movie, the script manages to turn things around (sometimes barely) and keeps its characters above water comically speaking while still retaining its substantive drama, the small amount there is. Jim continues his balance tight rope walk between his over the top comedic antics, a more sophisticated, subtle humorous performance, and his dramatic abilities - not completely without stumbling at times. Overall, this movie succeeds to the end in providing the audience with a comedy entertainment that was its intention while providing some semblance of serious commentary about corporate greed and the plight of the impoverished. Seven out of Ten Stars.

Oh my lord, what were they thinking about with this one. It not only is frantically unfunny, but worse, a very good original was trashed in the bargain. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, actually turned in the performance of her life in that one. Even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life. Maybe she is just flat good as a crook. Any other time, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal team up beautifully, so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby, catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from.Because very very very little of that one remains, to this ones horror. Nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when Dick and Jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss..... and uhh........oh my lord, that's it? Well, looks like it. It truly is that bad a film.

Jim Carrey is hard to beat in a role like this. He looks like the all American yuppie - tall, clean shaven, well dressed, and in control of his life - and his comedic delivery has been refined into a polished riff. All is believable when he lets loose because you know this is a guy who has a great sense of humor and he can get you to laugh until you lose your breath without grossing you out or making you groan at absurd silliness. Even while prancing or jabbing the air or contorting his face, Carrey is - hands down - the sexiest comedian on screen today. Tea Leoni is a good match for him because she too can be sexy while doing pratfalls or ending up with mud on her face. This is a dream coupling that should be repeated in more light comedies the way William Powell & Myrna Loy were paired in The Thin Man series.I found this remake head and shoulders above the original because it had far more energy and there was more 'sympatico' in the match of personalities of Dick & Jane. The new version also has a much more important message about corporate shenanigans and its grave impact on modern society. The film moves at a quick pace and was too short for me, but that's only because I didn't want to leave these characters. They became that fun couple you always invite to your get-togethers because they are the life of every party.

I thought I have seen almost all the films of Jim Carrey, but then I found that's not true, so I decided to start with this. This is a remake of the 70s film or you could say the second screen adaptation of the novel of the same name. I haven't seen the other version, but I must admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly. This is not the greatest comedy I have ever seen, but still so good with great performances, particularly Jim Carrey's.A simple storyline, a couple loses their jobs and they find hard to get another. They begin to lose one by one, everything that belongs to them and finally the house is the last thing they want to lose. So they plan to do something very serious thing to tackle their situation and seems its working out so well, but for how long. Then comes their masterplan to the permanent solution and how they accomplish it is what leads to the conclusion.The film was so fast, feels too short or like a TV episode. That means makes us to feel to have more, but it ends very nice way. The story might feel silly, but the comedies are so good. And if you like Jim Carrey and his trademark jokes, then you would have a great time. Truly, I haven't seen a good comedy from the recent time releases, so I'm happy I saw this, even though it is a decade old. There's no serious negative stuffs in it like drugs, sex or nudity, so I think it is okay for family viewing.7/10

Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he's a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example).However, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has NOTHING else to recommend it.Even if you do like Carrey's comedy, I am not sure you will find this film amusing. I went to see it on a Saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. They giggled throughout the trailers, which weren't particularly funny, but when it came to the film, stony silence. I think it raised about five genuine laughs.The problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. It can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious. If it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but (I'm guessing) it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters.The strong point of the film is the hold-ups, and there was plenty of potential here. But these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. Meanwhile, you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates.Four separate groups walked out of this film while I was there, and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house (his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation!), I would have done the same. And in my entire 25 years of movie going, I have done that just once before.
