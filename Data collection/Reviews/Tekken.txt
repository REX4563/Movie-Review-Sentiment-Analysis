Okay just finished watching this and wow is it bad. I could sit here and kick the heck out've it for not being faithful to the game, which hooo boy it isn't, but then all I'll get is a bunch of people going "It's Tekken The Movie, NOT Tekken The Game!".So I'll review it as a simple action movie. The plot was thin, the character motivations were practically nil and the fight scenes were shot with far too many cuts. The acting ranged from over the top to poor.Interestingly for a movie that did not in any way respect the storyline of the game, it went out of it's way to include homages to it. Hell entire characters were in it for no more than that. Anna Williams didn't have a fight or indeed even a line! She existed for no other reason to name drop and to wander about in her underwear. While we're on the subject of the Williams sister's what the heck is wrong with Nina's face?!? I have no idea if this is true, but it looks like it's been constructed in the operating theatre, apologies if it wasn't, but DAMN.They also managed to incorrectly spell Cung Le's name in the credits.Not for Tekken fans as they'll get angry, not for action movie fans as they'll get bored.

I was surprised positively. Yes, it's a video game adaption and from what I can tell it doesn't stick too much too it story wise, but for me it was quite entertaining. It's stupid, but not yet on a level where you want to face palm yourself all the time. It's much more serious than DOA and I still like that one better, but that's mostly because of its all-out- trash-appeal and because the fight choreography is a million times better. In Tekken many fights look like training exercises, many cuts can't hide, that you're not watching one fight, but many separate actions. Plus, there are some shots that are supposed to look dramatic or cool, but the just look badly done.But all in all, it's mildly entertaining, it does look more expensive than it was, the cos-play-factor is bearable and some ideas in the fights are nice to see. I would never buy it, but for rent it's entertaining 90 minutes of mindless fun.

Okay, First thing's first.. I am only writing a review on this Film because the last guy who did a review has seriously done my head in, and clearly doesn't know what he is talking about, he says that this film was an awful and boring film.. however i am curious as to what he is comparing it to.Now on to the film, I at first wasn't too sure about watching this and had no high hopes as there has been little advertisement on this film and really isn't as big of a production as the likes of Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter. The Acting wasn't too great, However the fight scenes make up for that as when the fighting kicks in you completely forget about the Acting. The film is highly Watchable and good entertainment. I Personally would of given it a 7 if there was more back story on each individual character, and there was more original cast.. example.. why is raven in it and not hwoarang grrrHowever the film in my opinion is far better than street fighter the legend of chun-li and not as good as MK.. but it's exactly like the game's which is good.

IN the tradition of "Mortal Kombat", "Street Fighter" and other fighting video-game series comes "Tekken" to the big screen. If you expect a cinematic treat the likes of "The Dark Knight" or "Iron Man", you are on the wrong planet. However, if "Tekken" conjures for you visions of some handsome underdog hero fighting against grizzled hunks, and scantily-clad women attempting motions of kick-boxing and kicking-ass, you are on the right track.And you may even be taken up by the action in "Tekken". At least for the first half of the movie.Mainly, the movie is about a handsome and rebellious Jin Kazama (Jon Foo) who gets reluctantly drawn into the Iron Fist tournament organised by the mighty Tekken Corp. Jin learnt to fight from his mother Jun (Tamlyn Tomita) who also warns him to stay away from Tekken and the Iron Fist tourney! Of course, one thing leads to another and Jin finds himself in the highly-publicised tournament where he must fight contestants twice his size and having triple his experience. These are heavies like the 'bionic' Bryan Fury (Gary Daniels) and Russian contender Sergei Dragonov (Anton Kasabov). No prizes for guessing if Jin would tip the odds.And oh yes, he also meets curvy femmes like Christie Monteiro (Kelly Overton) and Nina Williams (Candice Hillebrand) who provide the requisite teaser and eye candy. In the course of his battles, he learns the truth about himself! With fast-paced action, brief dialogues and some dazzling fight sequences, one can easily get taken away by the Tekken action, even if they are ludicrous and downright incredulous. The plot is predictable, even with its twist involving Jin and chief villain Kazuya Mishima (Ian Anthony Dale) and his father Heihachi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa). Indeed, the narrative barely helps to sustain the action sequences - and the fighting scenes get repetitive and stale in the second half of the film.But then with a second-rate cast of relative unknowns, it is unrealistic to expect anything more than the visual delights of "DOA". What we can be thankful for is that director Dwight Little has kept the flick within 90 minutes and does not show too many bloody and gory scenes (yes, some video-game enthusiasts may find "Tekken" tame).VERDICT: For fighting game fans and adrenaline addicts. - by LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)

Why such a bad grade? Let me start off by telling you that I am a real fan of the Tekken series. Don't get me wrong, the movie was *ehhh* OK, but it was not Tekken.The story of the movie does not fit in the time line of Tekken series. There have been 6 tournaments so far & the movie does not adept any of them, but mixes up everything & makes a huge mess out off it. Everything is just misplaced. For example: Jun Kazama (Jins mother) dies in Tekken 2, Miguel Caballero Rojo joins Tekken 6 to avenge his sisters death, Sergei Dragunov entered Tekken 5 to infiltrate Mishima Zaibatsu Lab, Eddy Gordo enters Tekken 3 to find the murderer of his father, etc.In Tekken, every character has his/her own purpose of entering the tournament. In the movie the actors didn't even know what they were doing there. NONE of the actors fitted the shoes of their characters & I'm not talking about the resemblance. I could care less about the resemblance, cause I know it's damn near impossible to look like a fictional character. For example: Kazuya Mishima is a good person, turned bad after the Devil Gene took over him, he only wanted one thing ever since: kill Heihachi Mishima & Jin Kazama in order to get full power of the Devil Gene, Codename Raven is a spy, who was ordered to infiltrate Mishima Zaibatsu, etc.If you are interested in the story of Tekken, you don't have to play Tekken games. Just surf to: http://tekken.wikia.com/wiki/Tekken_Wiki & you'll know what Tekken is all about.So I mainly hate this movie, cause it doesn't bring Tekken, it just brings a random action entertainment flick. It's not as if Tekken storyline is a masterpiece or anything. It's just like going to 5* restaurant, ordering a chicken & getting some KFC on your plate. Not as if KFC is bad, it's just that you're not getting, what you've ordered, thats all. You get the point?

I was expecting something of the level of stupidity like the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat movies, so I was pleasantly surprised when the movie had a consistent script and some decent action. I was already fantasizing about my IMDb review, saying how I was expecting crap and found a gem.Of course, that only lasted for the first half of the movie. Afterwards, attempts to make the movie follow a script, budget concerns and other movie politics made it all fall into the gutter of action movies when the cardboard villain must come into focus and be honorably defeated by the hero. I call bullshit. If the movie would have continued in the same style as the first half of the movie, where heroes meet on the battlefield of the arena and wither win or lose, it would have been a decent, even good film. Instead, hair gel and bad villain lines polluted the ending and turned it into another crappy video game movie. Why?!?!?Summary: Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa should have asked for a fortune in payment for the silly hair style of his character, probably something taken from the video game Tekken, that I have never played. The main character looked like a combination of Jean Claud van Damme and the vampire from Twilight. The hot chick that is the focus of his male desire gives him a kiss after being totally easy, but she denies him any... ahem... action. He returns to his slum where a girlfriend that actually wants and accepts sex awaits him. That part was artfully realistic. Tamlyn Tomita is still hot as hell, even if she keeps playing roles of moms that have to die. Kelly Overton mimics some decent fight moves, even if her only purpose in the movie is to look good.After thoughts: I wonder what would have happened if the hot girl would have actually had to participate in the tournament and fight Jin, and then the father grandfather angle actually been used in a royal politics manner... a good script maybe? Why did Raven (a black guy with white clothes and white hair?! An albino raven, maybe? What hair gel company sponsor this movie?Bottom line: watch 45 minutes of the movie. Stop. Fantasize about what cool movie this could have been. That is the only way to enjoy this film.

First off, I am a die hard Tekken fan. It is one of my favorite fighting game franchises. When i heard that there was a Tekken movie, my immediate thought was "Oh no, they are going to ruin it." WELL, I was wrong. I actually enjoyed it! I liked every bit of it. The story may not have been that great but you think about it, its hard trying to establish a story entwining 40 or so fighters in the entire franchise. The acting may not be great, but they are trained stunt-men and martial artists. The sets were cool, the costumes/makeup were great (except for Heihachi, his hairdo was a mess). There were some moments that had me scratching my head in disbelief but I'm not going to complain. (Thats what nitpickers do and I'm not a nitpicker). My only disappointment is that some of my favorite fighters weren't featured. Like Hwoarang, King and Lili. Thats all I have to say. Its no masterpiece nor as good as MK but I recommend this to anyone that enjoys Tekken or martial arts. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.

"You will fight, the world will watch, and my legacy will be written with your blood."Tekken actually wasn't half-bad. I'm as surprised to be saying that as you probably are to be reading it. It probably helped that the bar is so low for video game adaptations, and that the last such movie I saw was King of Fighters, which was awful to an absurd degree. Tekken can't help but look good in comparison to that. It helps that it makes at least an effort to keep some of the story and characters from the games, while offering frequent decent, if not great, fight scenes. The overuse of flashbacks gets a little old, but that's a much more minor issue than I was expecting Tekken to have. I have to mention that Tekken looks pretty good, with some impressive sets and a slick, high-budget veneer. The main actors are adequate, with John Foo as Jin being a capable fighter and believable enough as an earnest and ultimately good-hearted guy. Kelly Overton doesn't have a lot to do other than look hot in her greatly revised role as Christie, but she's infinitely qualified in that particular area. She does okay in her action scenes, too. Ian Anthony Dale is appropriately villainous as Kazuya, and everyone else is at least acceptable. Tekken is basically just another fighting tournament movie, placed in a video game setting. But, that's all it really needs to be. The story is simple and straight-forward, and I think that's a good thing. Keep in mind that this isn't supposed to be a 100% accurate adaptation of the game, and it'll probably entertain you.

This movie for any true Tekken fan, is a slap in the face. The storyline is all messed up, the characters just do not fit, Cung Le as Marshall Law? Hell no and Jin sounds British. The acting was horrible, Heihachi looked nothing like Heihachi, and Kazuya and Jin both had more honor and respect than Heihachi ever did. Heihachi with a heart? Kazuya A rapist? Just uncalled for.As far as anyone saying that they were entertained with these fights, you are probably a fan of the WWE. Even though fake, at least a lot of movies go the extra mile to showcase some sort of realism to the strikes, whereas in this movie the kicks, punches, and insanity done are miles from the areas that had been struck.Save yourself the time people, as far as video game movies are concerned, I would rather watch Bloodrayne or Far Cry. (Both of which were horrible.)

While there was reason to dislike the movie from both fan-based point- of-views (Lack of characters from a game that has quite a healthy roster, especially the absence of two main characters/transformations that could have been an obvious choice for the final bout) and movie critics point-of-view (scene inconsistencies, story), I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie. I didn't take any notice of the 'goofs' that were listed on this site while I was watching the film. Characters were imitated to a decent quality and the action was quite solid. But I feel what most critics are forgetting, is that yes a 'good movie' requires a good plot..or so that's what the critics seem to believe.. This is based off a FIGHTING game. A fighting game that also focuses more on fighting than story. So you shouldn't expect much more from a movie based on just that. To sum it up, I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't actually take my word for it.. In fact don't take any critic's word for it. I know from personal experience that only you will know whether you will enjoy a movie or not. People have different opinions and this is merely my opinion. I would be interested in an open-discussion about this movie anyways though :)POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT:I WANT A SEQUEL! I feel like there's a love triangle going on that needs to develop/conclude in the next movie. Also I want to see more fighters..especially devil,devil jin,ogre,jinpachi. And Heihachi Mishima is NOT dead ;)

I guess you could rate Tekken based on the video game or as a movie on its own. Either way its as bad as it can possible get. The story feels artificial just to get on with the fights, you feel during the whole movie that the characters are totally out of place.Jin Kazama in this movie has for some odd reason Australian accent and has no martial arts training from what i can see. Marshal Law is not a bruce lee character anymore, he is suddenly a beefed up MMA fighter!Jun (Jin's mother) and Kazuya is enemies for also some weird reason. The only things they are keeping from the game are some of the clothes and hairstyles. If you would review it as a fighting movie it would be bad as well, cause the fighting is non existent. Tekken is nice cause you have fighters with different fighting styles. Here you have mostly MMA fighting which consists of no real proper training behind it.This movie fails on so many levels. How on earth can a director get money to make a movie like this?

Look I understand Video Game movies have a stigma about them but to hate on a movie due to the lack of authenticity you should look again. The writers of this movie did the best they could to pick out the story of Tekken. What people do not understand is when a movie is made they can take liberties with the story because it is "Based" on characters not carbon copies. I enjoyed this film from beginning to end, some of the writing was bad and some of the actors could have been better(Movies now a days have the same issue), but you have to realize most of the actors in this film are actual MMA and martial artists. I liked how they changed things around to make sense of it all, especially for those who will be fresh to the story of Tekken. The fighting was top notch, Jin was likable, you really felt like he was an ordinary Joe. I loved the fact that the film was left open (watch after the credits). This movie to me has a wonderful replay value almost like "Kickboxer" on crack. All you fans need to get your heads out of your A$$ and enjoy the movie for what it is. If you like Tournament, Fighting or even a nice action flick this one is for you.

I just finished watching it - and it's not that bad. Of course, it's nowhere as good VG adaptation as Mortal Kombat 1995 (fighting game) or Silent Hill (if thinking about all Vg movies in general), but it's better than Dragonball Evolution, Street Fighter, SF: Legend of Chun Li, and DOA: Dead or Alive. In terms of faithfulness, it's not really to my liking as a Tekken games fan, that they changed much of the story around - but I'm not too surprised since it's being done to a lot of VG movies, such as Resident Evil films, and the Hit-man movie which just borrowed elements from the games (such as "Heihachi Mishima is Dead" quote from Tekken 5, Devil Gene vaguely implied with the quote "Curse of the Mishima Bloodline" Fights were pretty entertaining, though I wish they would have shown the actual fighting styles that match with the actual styles stated (for example, in the movie, it states Raven does Ninjitsu and Dragunov does Sambo, but they're not using those styles at all), Heihachi's fighting action was way too limited (interrupting Jin's fight with Yoshimitsu to save Jin and that's it), and Anna didn't fight at all in the tournament, she does attack Jin in the darkness with her sister Nina, but it's very short and hard to see cause they fight in the dark. Also,final fight between Jin and Kazuya was very disappointing - I was very let down by how short and how weak they made Kazuya (he slashes a worn out Jin on the chest, but when Kazuya himself who isn't even worn out gets slashed by his own axe in a little cut, it's game over? Jesus. One of the highlights of the film would be Ian Anthony Dale's acting as Kazuya (some people may be more familiar with his role as Scorpion in MK: Rebirth). He did surprising well in this role, and I could see his as Scorpion in a upcoming MK film (though I don't want it to be Rebirth). There are some corny lines (such as Eddy's "come on boy!") and some really annoying moments (such as those two punks cheering on Jin on his final fights, they were as annoying to me as those hackers from the Transformers movie. Also, Christie's so-called romance with Jin really didn't convince me either, though I do have to admit Overton is very hot). Anyway, I relatively enjoyed the movie (like when I watched Resident Evil films and Hit-man film), but I guess I owe it partly due to setting my expectations pretty low before watching - and it keeps me thinking could they have done a better job with bigger budget? And if the director and his team were someone like Joey Ansah and his crew for SF Legacy short film, what would it be like?

"If you can still breathe you can still fight, your only defeated when you decide." In the future countries no longer exist. The world is owned by corporations, each of which as a competitor in the "Iron-Fist" fighting tournament. Looking to avenge the death of his mother at the hands of the Tekken group, Jin (Foo) fights his way to the tournament. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Very, very entertaining with very good fighting scenes. It also stayed very close to the video game, complete with the pick-a-fighter sections. The downfall of this movie is the same problem with all video game movies though. When the movie is just the one-on-one fighting sequences like the game has it is very strong and fun to watch. When it tries to add a story aspect and a plot is where it begins to drag. But the filmmakers knew this I think and the movie never strays too far from the tournament aspect for too long. Overall, much better then I expected, and knowing it's a video game you will have certain expectations going in. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - I actually might.*Also try - Muay Thai Fighter

After watching the movie there was lots of things that were really distracting. 1 - the Entire movie does not go with the game storyline, which is kinda pointless of making. The only thing that was similar to the game was the character looks, and they did not even get that done well. 2 - there is no background to the characters being shown, for example the whole world is fallen in to corruption, but how? Jin is suddenly the son of Kazuya, but when did it happen? Jun Kazama fought in Iron Fist, when? Steve Fox knew Jun Kazama, how? lots of things they could have added to the movie to make it better, even though it was not related to the game storyline as many Tekken game players here would have realised very easily. 3 - Character moves was a major issue personally as lots of people that have played the games would have realised that the characters have some pretty nice moves when fighting, the point of the movie is to make people want to play the game but the movie just showed some moves that more or less anyone would be able to do.4 - The movie does not even state when the story is taking place, but with Dragunov appearing i would suggest it is during Tekken 6 probably, or Tekken 5. But the stage suggests it to be Tekken 4. Jin entering the tournament now suggests it to be Tekken 3, but then Kazuya appearing with a scar now suggests it to be Tekken 4! Wow this is getting really confusing!5 - The companies that are involved hugely are Mishima Zaibatsu, G Corp. Mishima Zaibatsu lead by Heihachi(Jin takes over when Heihachi was announced Dead in Tekken 5) and G Corp lead by Kazuya.The game has a very impacting story with the character relationships, the entire Mishima family more or less hate everyone. Kazuya hates Jin and Heihachi, Heihachi hates Jin and Kazuya, Jin hates Kazuya and Heihachi. and then Anna and Nina both hate each other. Heihachi is the rapist not Kazuya, although Kazuya is evil deep down he does have a soft side, from which Jin was born. Heihachi has 3 sons, 2 of which are biological and 1 being an adopted son. The movie although it was slightly impacting the story did not really meet the standards of the game, but it was better than the Street Fighter 2009 movie, but the best Fighting game adaptation in my opinion would be Dead or Alive and Street Fighter(Van Damme) as they had good fighting as well as story, but i do not know much of Dead or alive as i have not played the game.So overall i would say watch it and make your own judgement on it, as most people that have played the game would not find the movie enjoying. But if you would rather see a better storyline than the movie then i would suggest in playing the Tekken 6.

Boring watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.I tried and fell asleep on this 3 times. There is plenty of things happening, but who cares, really?The movie goes far out of the way to disconnect the audience from the characters, world and action.Maybe I'll update this if I can ever get through it, but I can't see it being better than what I think it is right now.Unless you're just a big Tekken fan, go watch "Dead or Alive" instead.

The legendary fighting game finally came into live action movie! As a fans of the game, I felt that I have to watch this movie despite bad reviews by other IMDb users.They're right. The story was so awful? yes. The movie looks cheap? yes. The characters had very different personality compared to the game? yes. Nina is too horny? yes.The fighting scenes isn't too bad, at least. Much better that that Dragon Ball Evolution. It's still enjoyable, with fast-paced background music. But the fights took place on very badly decorated arena.Of course, there were many stupid things in this movie. When Jin was attacked inside his room, Christie Monteiro can't even break the door by force! She has to break the window with something nearby, and then open the door using handle? What a lame way! These first class fighters are supposed to have great power in their muscle.The characters didn't perform their signature moves on the game. Where's that dragon uppercut used by the Mishimas (including Jin)? I didn't expect that the fighters will emit lightning, fire, etc from their body like that in the game, but at least please use their original moves in the game.This movie will disappoint you, either you're fans of the game or not.

The only thing the movie and the beat'em up series have in common are names. This movie is bad and unentertaining to the core. It sure does have a few good looking women in it, but that is about it. Cheap dialogs, bad acting and worse fight scenes, the thing a movie adaption of Tekken should possibly be about. Each Tekken character in the game has signature moves and a certain style, which the movie attempts show, but fails horribly. The characters do not have any depth, being stereotypes at the most, but fitting perfectly in a scenario glued together from bad cliché. Though i acknowledge that it is basic stuff that makes the world go round and the heart of the audience beat, THIS is not IT.I do not think this is what the Iron Fist series deserves, if you are a fan, spare yourself the agony watching it.i gave it 3 out of 10, because i saw a lot of movies in my time and this is like the saying "E for effort".

This movie is hard to discern. It has its ups and downs, its cheesy moments and its groundbreaking battles... As a stand-alone movie, one might think it pretty good. The acting isn't as bad as independent movies usually deliver. The characters are two-dimensional, and all the main characters were adorned with minimal background stories that blended in well with the movie; in other words, they didn't feel forced just so you can know the characters better. Also, unlike other movies that start off from one setting and then jump to a luxurious island/mansion/castle, etc., this movie maintains its dystopian vibe from beginning to end, maintaining the reality of its world its inviting you in. Compared to the games, there were a lot of disappointments. The characters dress like they do in the games, yet none of the actors are physically similar to them, nor do they talk like them. Also, some important characters (Heihachi, Kazuya, Nina) were extremely reduced to a disappointing level, while others (Christie, Steve, Raven) were needlessly emphasized. The movie actually manages to grasp your attention, but halfway through, it spans out of control, and the final fight was a major disappointment. I will also say that I'm glad some core characters like Paul Phoenix, Lei Wulong and Hwoarang were left out; it's better to leave them untouched than to ruin them.All in all, the movie might have had more credit if it changed the title and the names of the characters. In other words, it didn't need to be a Tekken adaption. One could easily come up with a movie based around a tournament without disappointing a lot of gamers (because let's face it, most of the people that watch these types of movies are gamers).

Okay just finished watching this and wow is it bad. I could sit here and kick the heck out've it for not being faithful to the game, which hooo boy it isn't, but then all I'll get is a bunch of people going "It's Tekken The Movie, NOT Tekken The Game!".So I'll review it as a simple action movie. The plot was thin, the character motivations were practically nil and the fight scenes were shot with far too many cuts.

Hell entire characters were in it for no more than that. Anna Williams didn't have a fight or indeed even a line! She existed for no other reason to name drop and to wander about in her underwear. While we're on the subject of the Williams sister's what the heck is wrong with Nina's face?!? I have no idea if this is true, but it looks like it's been constructed in the operating theatre, apologies if it wasn't, but DAMN.They also managed to incorrectly spell Cung Le's name in the credits.Not for Tekken fans as they'll get angry, not for action movie fans as they'll get bored.

I was surprised positively. Yes, it's a video game adaption and from what I can tell it doesn't stick too much too it story wise, but for me it was quite entertaining. It's stupid, but not yet on a level where you want to face palm yourself all the time. It's much more serious than DOA and I still like that one better, but that's mostly because of its all-out- trash-appeal and because the fight choreography is a million times better. In Tekken many fights look like training exercises, many cuts can't hide, that you're not watching one fight, but many separate actions. Plus, there are some shots that are supposed to look dramatic or cool, but the just look badly done.But all in all, it's mildly entertaining, it does look more expensive than it was, the cos-play-factor is bearable and some ideas in the fights are nice to see. I would never buy it, but for rent it's entertaining 90 minutes of mindless fun.

Why such a bad grade? Let me start off by telling you that I am a real fan of the Tekken series. Don't get me wrong, the movie was *ehhh* OK, but it was not Tekken.The story of the movie does not fit in the time line of Tekken series. There have been 6 tournaments so far & the movie does not adept any of them, but mixes up everything & makes a huge mess out off it. Everything is just misplaced. For example: Jun Kazama (Jins mother) dies in Tekken 2, Miguel Caballero Rojo joins Tekken 6 to avenge his sisters death, Sergei Dragunov entered Tekken 5 to infiltrate Mishima Zaibatsu Lab, Eddy Gordo enters Tekken 3 to find the murderer of his father, etc.In Tekken, every character has his/her own purpose of entering the tournament.

Just surf to: http://tekken.wikia.com/wiki/Tekken_Wiki & you'll know what Tekken is all about.So I mainly hate this movie, cause it doesn't bring Tekken, it just brings a random action entertainment flick. It's not as if Tekken storyline is a masterpiece or anything. It's just like going to 5* restaurant, ordering a chicken & getting some KFC on your plate. Not as if KFC is bad, it's just that you're not getting, what you've ordered, thats all. You get the point?

I was expecting something of the level of stupidity like the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat movies, so I was pleasantly surprised when the movie had a consistent script and some decent action. I was already fantasizing about my IMDb review, saying how I was expecting crap and found a gem.Of course, that only lasted for the first half of the movie. Afterwards, attempts to make the movie follow a script, budget concerns and other movie politics made it all fall into the gutter of action movies when the cardboard villain must come into focus and be honorably defeated by the hero. I call bullshit. If the movie would have continued in the same style as the first half of the movie, where heroes meet on the battlefield of the arena and wither win or lose, it would have been a decent, even good film. Instead, hair gel and bad villain lines polluted the ending and turned it into another crappy video game movie. Why?!?!?Summary: Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa should have asked for a fortune in payment for the silly hair style of his character, probably something taken from the video game Tekken, that I have never played. The main character looked like a combination of Jean Claud van Damme and the vampire from Twilight. The hot chick that is the focus of his male desire gives him a kiss after being totally easy, but she denies him any... ahem... action. He returns to his slum where a girlfriend that actually wants and accepts sex awaits him. That part was artfully realistic. Tamlyn Tomita is still hot as hell, even if she keeps playing roles of moms that have to die. Kelly Overton mimics some decent fight moves, even if her only purpose in the movie is to look good.After thoughts: I wonder what would have happened if the hot girl would have actually had to participate in the tournament and fight Jin, and then the father grandfather angle actually been used in a royal politics manner... a good script maybe? Why did Raven (a black guy with white clothes and white hair?! An albino raven, maybe? What hair gel company sponsor this movie?Bottom line: watch 45 minutes of the movie. Stop. Fantasize about what cool movie this could have been. That is the only way to enjoy this film.

First off, I am a die hard Tekken fan. It is one of my favorite fighting game franchises. When i heard that there was a Tekken movie, my immediate thought was "Oh no, they are going to ruin it." WELL, I was wrong. I actually enjoyed it! I liked every bit of it. The story may not have been that great but you think about it, its hard trying to establish a story entwining 40 or so fighters in the entire franchise. The acting may not be great, but they are trained stunt-men and martial artists. The sets were cool, the costumes/makeup were great (except for Heihachi, his hairdo was a mess). There were some moments that had me scratching my head in disbelief but I'm not going to complain. (Thats what nitpickers do and I'm not a nitpicker). My only disappointment is that some of my favorite fighters weren't featured. Like Hwoarang, King and Lili. Thats all I have to say. Its no masterpiece nor as good as MK but I recommend this to anyone that enjoys Tekken or martial arts. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.

"You will fight, the world will watch, and my legacy will be written with your blood."Tekken actually wasn't half-bad. I'm as surprised to be saying that as you probably are to be reading it. It probably helped that the bar is so low for video game adaptations, and that the last such movie I saw was King of Fighters, which was awful to an absurd degree. Tekken can't help but look good in comparison to that. It helps that it makes at least an effort to keep some of the story and characters from the games, while offering frequent decent, if not great, fight scenes. The overuse of flashbacks gets a little old, but that's a much more minor issue than I was expecting Tekken to have. I have to mention that Tekken looks pretty good, with some impressive sets and a slick, high-budget veneer. The main actors are adequate, with John Foo as Jin being a capable fighter and believable enough as an earnest and ultimately good-hearted guy. Kelly Overton doesn't have a lot to do other than look hot in her greatly revised role as Christie, but she's infinitely qualified in that particular area. She does okay in her action scenes, too. Ian Anthony Dale is appropriately villainous as Kazuya, and everyone else is at least acceptable. Tekken is basically just another fighting tournament movie, placed in a video game setting. But, that's all it really needs to be. The story is simple and straight-forward, and I think that's a good thing. Keep in mind that this isn't supposed to be a 100% accurate adaptation of the game, and it'll probably entertain you.

This movie for any true Tekken fan, is a slap in the face. The storyline is all messed up, the characters just do not fit, Cung Le as Marshall Law? Hell no and Jin sounds British. The acting was horrible, Heihachi looked nothing like Heihachi, and Kazuya and Jin both had more honor and respect than Heihachi ever did. Heihachi with a heart? Kazuya A rapist? Just uncalled for.As far as anyone saying that they were entertained with these fights, you are probably a fan of the WWE. Even though fake, at least a lot of movies go the extra mile to showcase some sort of realism to the strikes, whereas in this movie the kicks, punches, and insanity done are miles from the areas that had been struck.Save yourself the time people, as far as video game movies are concerned, I would rather watch Bloodrayne or Far Cry. (Both of which were horrible.)

While there was reason to dislike the movie from both fan-based point- of-views (Lack of characters from a game that has quite a healthy roster, especially the absence of two main characters/transformations that could have been an obvious choice for the final bout) and movie critics point-of-view (scene inconsistencies, story), I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie. I didn't take any notice of the 'goofs' that were listed on this site while I was watching the film. Characters were imitated to a decent quality and the action was quite solid. But I feel what most critics are forgetting, is that yes a 'good movie' requires a good plot..or so that's what the critics seem to believe.. This is based off a FIGHTING game. A fighting game that also focuses more on fighting than story. So you shouldn't expect much more from a movie based on just that. To sum it up, I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't actually take my word for it.. In fact don't take any critic's word for it. I know from personal experience that only you will know whether you will enjoy a movie or not. People have different opinions and this is merely my opinion. I would be interested in an open-discussion about this movie anyways though :)POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT:I WANT A SEQUEL! I feel like there's a love triangle going on that needs to develop/conclude in the next movie. Also I want to see more fighters..especially devil,devil jin,ogre,jinpachi. And Heihachi Mishima is NOT dead ;)

I guess you could rate Tekken based on the video game or as a movie on its own. Either way its as bad as it can possible get. The story feels artificial just to get on with the fights, you feel during the whole movie that the characters are totally out of place.Jin Kazama in this movie has for some odd reason Australian accent and has no martial arts training from what i can see. Marshal Law is not a bruce lee character anymore, he is suddenly a beefed up MMA fighter!Jun (Jin's mother) and Kazuya is enemies for also some weird reason. The only things they are keeping from the game are some of the clothes and hairstyles. If you would review it as a fighting movie it would be bad as well, cause the fighting is non existent. Tekken is nice cause you have fighters with different fighting styles. Here you have mostly MMA fighting which consists of no real proper training behind it.This movie fails on so many levels. How on earth can a director get money to make a movie like this?

Look I understand Video Game movies have a stigma about them but to hate on a movie due to the lack of authenticity you should look again. The writers of this movie did the best they could to pick out the story of Tekken. What people do not understand is when a movie is made they can take liberties with the story because it is "Based" on characters not carbon copies. I enjoyed this film from beginning to end, some of the writing was bad and some of the actors could have been better(Movies now a days have the same issue), but you have to realize most of the actors in this film are actual MMA and martial artists. I liked how they changed things around to make sense of it all, especially for those who will be fresh to the story of Tekken. The fighting was top notch, Jin was likable, you really felt like he was an ordinary Joe. I loved the fact that the film was left open (watch after the credits). This movie to me has a wonderful replay value almost like "Kickboxer" on crack. All you fans need to get your heads out of your A$$ and enjoy the movie for what it is. If you like Tournament, Fighting or even a nice action flick this one is for you.

I just finished watching it - and it's not that bad. Of course, it's nowhere as good VG adaptation as Mortal Kombat 1995 (fighting game) or Silent Hill (if thinking about all Vg movies in general), but it's better than Dragonball Evolution, Street Fighter, SF: Legend of Chun Li, and DOA: Dead or Alive. In terms of faithfulness, it's not really to my liking as a Tekken games fan, that they changed much of the story around - but I'm not too surprised since it's being done to a lot of VG movies, such as Resident Evil films, and the Hit-man movie which just borrowed elements from the games (such as "Heihachi Mishima is Dead" quote from Tekken 5, Devil Gene vaguely implied with the quote "Curse of the Mishima Bloodline" Fights were pretty entertaining, though I wish they would have shown the actual fighting styles that match with the actual styles stated (for example, in the movie, it states Raven does Ninjitsu and Dragunov does Sambo, but they're not using those styles at all), Heihachi's fighting action was way too limited (interrupting Jin's fight with Yoshimitsu to save Jin and that's it), and Anna didn't fight at all in the tournament, she does attack Jin in the darkness with her sister Nina, but it's very short and hard to see cause they fight in the dark. Also,final fight between Jin and Kazuya was very disappointing - I was very let down by how short and how weak they made Kazuya (he slashes a worn out Jin on the chest, but when Kazuya himself who isn't even worn out gets slashed by his own axe in a little cut, it's game over? Jesus. One of the highlights of the film would be Ian Anthony Dale's acting as Kazuya (some people may be more familiar with his role as Scorpion in MK: Rebirth). He did surprising well in this role, and I could see his as Scorpion in a upcoming MK film (though I don't want it to be Rebirth). There are some corny lines (such as Eddy's "come on boy!") and some really annoying moments (such as those two punks cheering on Jin on his final fights, they were as annoying to me as those hackers from the Transformers movie. Also, Christie's so-called romance with Jin really didn't convince me either, though I do have to admit Overton is very hot). Anyway, I relatively enjoyed the movie (like when I watched Resident Evil films and Hit-man film), but I guess I owe it partly due to setting my expectations pretty low before watching - and it keeps me thinking could they have done a better job with bigger budget? And if the director and his team were someone like Joey Ansah and his crew for SF Legacy short film, what would it be like?

The movie had brilliant fight scenes, however, being a huge fan of the original story line, it was quite a disappointment for fans all over the world due to the huge amount of changes from the original story line.Steve Fox introducing Jin to the tournament?? Heihachi "a good guy" Mishima? Love between Christie and Jin?I think that such a movie should first be released with the story based around the group of fighters, THEN maybe releasing movies with more details on a character's profile. Like X-men's Wolverine movie if you know what I mean. The movie being immediately based on 1 character's profile was not a good idea, in my opinion.People new to Tekken will not get much interest to the story after watching this, since the mostly attracted crowd was people who actually had an idea of the original story line.It was a good film to look forward to, but the story was highly sped up. I hope a sequel will follow with more character profiles as almost every posted review has asked for :)And also, the fans would appreciate one of the most classic characters in the movie. Give us Roger!!!! ;pOther than that I would like to mention again that the fight scenes were awesome, especially the highly matched fighting styles with the game for all those fans out there, seeing their favorite characters in real life action. Eddy Gordo and Brian Fury fans, you ll be the most to appreciate what I'm talking about ;)

"If you can still breathe you can still fight, your only defeated when you decide." In the future countries no longer exist. The world is owned by corporations, each of which as a competitor in the "Iron-Fist" fighting tournament. Looking to avenge the death of his mother at the hands of the Tekken group, Jin (Foo) fights his way to the tournament. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Very, very entertaining with very good fighting scenes. It also stayed very close to the video game, complete with the pick-a-fighter sections. The downfall of this movie is the same problem with all video game movies though. When the movie is just the one-on-one fighting sequences like the game has it is very strong and fun to watch. When it tries to add a story aspect and a plot is where it begins to drag. But the filmmakers knew this I think and the movie never strays too far from the tournament aspect for too long. Overall, much better then I expected, and knowing it's a video game you will have certain expectations going in. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - I actually might.*Also try - Muay Thai Fighter

Good points: some of the fight/dance moves, various bits of beefcake (both genders), some of the SFX.Bad points: just about everything else.This movie is cliché after cliché. The "world in turmoil and run by evil corporations" schlock, the "mommy taught me everything I know Oh no she's dead better avenge her", the "I am your father, Luke"; everything.I had no idea that to enjoy this movie you had to be a fan of the video game. It just looked kind of interesting from the outside but what a waste of cash it turned out to be. Even as a video game movie it appeared pointless. Where's the back-story? Why are the characters what they are? How the hell did this stupid movie get funding? etc.It will entertain pubescent bloodthirsty fans of homo-erotic violence (read: teenage boys) but even then it's just a time killer. No substance, no epiphanies, just blood, cliché, blood, cliché and blood.I want my money back.

After watching the movie there was lots of things that were really distracting. 1 - the Entire movie does not go with the game storyline, which is kinda pointless of making. The only thing that was similar to the game was the character looks, and they did not even get that done well. 2 - there is no background to the characters being shown, for example the whole world is fallen in to corruption, but how? Jin is suddenly the son of Kazuya, but when did it happen? Jun Kazama fought in Iron Fist, when? Steve Fox knew Jun Kazama, how? lots of things they could have added to the movie to make it better, even though it was not related to the game storyline as many Tekken game players here would have realised very easily. 3 - Character moves was a major issue personally as lots of people that have played the games would have realised that the characters have some pretty nice moves when fighting, the point of the movie is to make people want to play the game but the movie just showed some moves that more or less anyone would be able to do.4 - The movie does not even state when the story is taking place, but with Dragunov appearing i would suggest it is during Tekken 6 probably, or Tekken 5. But the stage suggests it to be Tekken 4. Jin entering the tournament now suggests it to be Tekken 3, but then Kazuya appearing with a scar now suggests it to be Tekken 4! Wow this is getting really confusing!5 - The companies that are involved hugely are Mishima Zaibatsu, G Corp. Mishima Zaibatsu lead by Heihachi(Jin takes over when Heihachi was announced Dead in Tekken 5) and G Corp lead by Kazuya.The game has a very impacting story with the character relationships, the entire Mishima family more or less hate everyone. Kazuya hates Jin and Heihachi, Heihachi hates Jin and Kazuya, Jin hates Kazuya and Heihachi. and then Anna and Nina both hate each other. Heihachi is the rapist not Kazuya, although Kazuya is evil deep down he does have a soft side, from which Jin was born. Heihachi has 3 sons, 2 of which are biological and 1 being an adopted son. The movie although it was slightly impacting the story did not really meet the standards of the game, but it was better than the Street Fighter 2009 movie, but the best Fighting game adaptation in my opinion would be Dead or Alive and Street Fighter(Van Damme) as they had good fighting as well as story, but i do not know much of Dead or alive as i have not played the game.So overall i would say watch it and make your own judgement on it, as most people that have played the game would not find the movie enjoying. But if you would rather see a better storyline than the movie then i would suggest in playing the Tekken 6.

Boring watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.I tried and fell asleep on this 3 times. There is plenty of things happening, but who cares, really?The movie goes far out of the way to disconnect the audience from the characters, world and action.Maybe I'll update this if I can ever get through it, but I can't see it being better than what I think it is right now.Unless you're just a big Tekken fan, go watch "Dead or Alive" instead.

When I was a child there was 3 video games that to this day will always go down in history as my favorite games ever made. One of those games happened to be Tekken. When I first heard about this movie I was pretty psyched. To be honest, I didn't really know what to expect. To say the least I wasn't "Butt Hurt" but I wasn't happy either. From the perspective of somebody who has never played the games before, this would in fact be a good film. However, from the perspective of somebody who has played the games... I found myself saying "omg what are you guys doing this isn't how that happened" almost every 5 minutes in this film. I guess I now know how those guys who say "The book was better" feel. A lot of the Tekken characters in this movie where completely out of character compared to the character they portray in the gaming world. Like I said though, I can see how someone who has never played the console games could enjoy this movie. Aside from all that, the content of the film as story progress wise was forced. The action is what made up for that downside. With all that being said as a loyal Tekken fan. I either hope A. They make an anime movie out of Tekken that sticks true to the roots or B. Does this movie some justice in a Hollywood remake. They're going to need to take a completely different approach if they want to attract the interests of the hardcore fans.

The only thing the movie and the beat'em up series have in common are names. This movie is bad and unentertaining to the core. It sure does have a few good looking women in it, but that is about it. Cheap dialogs, bad acting and worse fight scenes, the thing a movie adaption of Tekken should possibly be about. Each Tekken character in the game has signature moves and a certain style, which the movie attempts show, but fails horribly. The characters do not have any depth, being stereotypes at the most, but fitting perfectly in a scenario glued together from bad cliché. Though i acknowledge that it is basic stuff that makes the world go round and the heart of the audience beat, THIS is not IT.I do not think this is what the Iron Fist series deserves, if you are a fan, spare yourself the agony watching it.i gave it 3 out of 10, because i saw a lot of movies in my time and this is like the saying "E for effort".

The legendary fighting game finally came into live action movie! As a fans of the game, I felt that I have to watch this movie despite bad reviews by other IMDb users.They're right. The story was so awful? yes. The movie looks cheap? yes. The characters had very different personality compared to the game? yes. Nina is too horny? yes.The fighting scenes isn't too bad, at least. Much better that that Dragon Ball Evolution. It's still enjoyable, with fast-paced background music. But the fights took place on very badly decorated arena.Of course, there were many stupid things in this movie. When Jin was attacked inside his room, Christie Monteiro can't even break the door by force! She has to break the window with something nearby, and then open the door using handle? What a lame way! These first class fighters are supposed to have great power in their muscle.The characters didn't perform their signature moves on the game. Where's that dragon uppercut used by the Mishimas (including Jin)? I didn't expect that the fighters will emit lightning, fire, etc from their body like that in the game, but at least please use their original moves in the game.This movie will disappoint you, either you're fans of the game or not.

Fighting games make for poor plot material in general and I expected this to suck in terms of the story but I never expected it to suck on basically all levels. The fights were poor. Anyone who has played the game will come out of this very disappointed if what they are expecting to see is at least a decent fighting spectacle. The moves were generic, the action was boring and what was with the projected screen on the ring while they were fighting? Scenery? Not a single signature move from any of the characters. Not one. Again I wasn't expecting this one to have Oscar caliber storytelling, but you know an action movie falls flat on its face when even the action was generally terrible.Oh, and did Kazuya Mishima really have to look like George Michael? I mean come on... what did Kazuya do to deserve that?

did not seem to be a video game movie...unlike " street fighter." they did a good job of making the fight scenes seem realistic. the story line wasn't to bad either. i thought this film was going to be a disappointment...i was wrong. i thought it was better than any of jaun claudes movies. the women in this movie are all hott. there was even a little bit of sex scenes that were kinda spicy. the characters all had there own unique style. the one thing i was disappointed about was that yoshimitsu made a quick appearance and did not get enough camera time. some quirks about the movie was there really no surprise ending. all around it was a pretty good action packed movie that was surprisingly good...worth the time to watch.

This movie is hard to discern. It has its ups and downs, its cheesy moments and its groundbreaking battles... As a stand-alone movie, one might think it pretty good. The acting isn't as bad as independent movies usually deliver. The characters are two-dimensional, and all the main characters were adorned with minimal background stories that blended in well with the movie; in other words, they didn't feel forced just so you can know the characters better. Also, unlike other movies that start off from one setting and then jump to a luxurious island/mansion/castle, etc., this movie maintains its dystopian vibe from beginning to end, maintaining the reality of its world its inviting you in. Compared to the games, there were a lot of disappointments. The characters dress like they do in the games, yet none of the actors are physically similar to them, nor do they talk like them. Also, some important characters (Heihachi, Kazuya, Nina) were extremely reduced to a disappointing level, while others (Christie, Steve, Raven) were needlessly emphasized. The movie actually manages to grasp your attention, but halfway through, it spans out of control, and the final fight was a major disappointment. I will also say that I'm glad some core characters like Paul Phoenix, Lei Wulong and Hwoarang were left out; it's better to leave them untouched than to ruin them.All in all, the movie might have had more credit if it changed the title and the names of the characters. In other words, it didn't need to be a Tekken adaption. One could easily come up with a movie based around a tournament without disappointing a lot of gamers (because let's face it, most of the people that watch these types of movies are gamers).

The "Tekken" franchise has been a beloved game series to me. I truly loved the game play and I loved playing it. The characters were very creative and I almost enjoy every single character in the game.After years of rumors about the upcoming film, I was excited to watch the film. "Tekken" was like attached to my memory. It can already be called an anticipated movie. I bet the movie already has legions of fans waiting for the film to come in theaters.As I experienced this film,. I truly am disappointed with "Namco". I mean, they've created such a magnificent game for us to entertain ourselves. But, the movie was rubbish. How can "Namco" destroy its most precious work on the screen.In this film, many things are different. Maybe around 70% of the movie was different than the original series. The characters' storyline were different and worse. The stages where they fight was awful. I'm sure that once you watch this film, you'd be disappointed with it.Of course, the director is to blame. How can he destroy such a wonderful game series. His directing was very bad. I'm confused. Why would "Namco" choose a director who doesn't know how to create a good film ... AT ALL! Dwight H. Little is such a lame director. He should be ashamed of his work.Next, I didn't like the character casting. I wonder, who was in charge of the casting? He/she must look at the game characters carefully. Let me tell you one thing, they even have simple mistake. They cast a person with the wrong skin color from the games. I can't even manage a smile when I watched the film.Another thing I'm disappointed with is the story. How could they destroy the story of the games. It was just so different from the series and I can't believe "Namco" would allow that to happen. The story was so bad, 10 TIMES WORSE than the game series.If you want to see this, it's almost obvious that you would expect great action scenes. But, I don't think you'll get that experience here. The fighting scenes are not fun and they are not exciting at all. With bad music, there's nothing spectacular about the scenes, not at all. So, if you have a list what to expect from this film, cross our "Fighting/Action Scenes".If you're a "Tekken" fan, don't watch this. This is not what we call a modern film. This is what we call garbage. No matter how excited you are, I advise you to not watch this. I guarantee that once you go in the theater and stay there for a few minutes, you will sure want to go out of the theater immediately. I am so disappointed with the result of the film. I've risked things to watch this movie only to know that it's trash. So, if you still have the chance to avoid, do avoid it. Overall, I think "Tekken" should get 0 stars. But, since there's no 0, I have no choice but to give it a 1.
