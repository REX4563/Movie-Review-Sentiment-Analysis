Denzel Washington continues to prove why he is one of the best actors in the business with his performance in JOHN Q, a moving, emotional, and tension-charged drama about a family man whose son needs a heart transplant; however, due to financial problems, his insurance won't cover the cost of getting his son on the donor list so John Q decides to take hostages in the hospital until someone arranges for his son to be on the donor list. Despite a preachy and simplistic screenplay, the intense direction and first-rate performances make this film work. I particularly loved Denzel's work here because this was a character unlike he had ever played before...Denzel usually played well-educated, intelligent lawyers and/or businessmen (with the obvious exception of TRAINING DAY), but here Denzel is playing an average Joe...a working stiff, struggling to pay bills and keep food on the table and a roof over his family's head who is driven to extreme measures to protect the family he cherishes so dearly. Washington gets strong support from Robert Duvall, solid as always as the hostage negotiator, James Woods as a wimpy surgeon, Anne Heche as an unsympathetic hospital administrator, and especially Kimberly Elise as John's wife. An emotional drama, wrought with tension, that will rivet you to the screen.

Despite what people have said, this movie is NOTHING like Dog Day Afternoon. The only similarities between the two is that both films have to do with holding a public place hostage (In Dog Day Afternoon it was a Bank in John Q, its a hospital).  Sure, you see a sort of homage to Dog Day Afternoon in John Q, but thats it, the movie has its own plot.  I enjoyed this film, Denzel Washington is really believeable as the down-on-his-luck father, and the rest of the supporting cast executed their characters very well.  Most notably the great Robert Duvall as the hostage negotiator and Ray Liotta as the stuck-up police chief.  I won't say more about this movie other than it is heart-breaking and you can almost feel the pain frustration John Q has to go through.  4 stars out of 5.

Highly under-rated and ignored by most in 2002, "John Q" is one of those movies that is sometimes too intelligent for a viewing public unfamiliar with topics never really thought about in common societal circles (health care and insurance policies, rights of blue-collar citizens, media exploitation, law enforcement practices and over-paid medical specialists). Denzel Washington's young son falls out one day at a little league baseball game. The diagnosis is frightening. Without a new heart, the boy will most definitely die. Washington, a normal everyday citizen, lacks substantial resources and benefits from his insurance to even get his son on a donor's list. It is blatantly obvious that Washington and wife Kimberly Elise are being strangled by red tape in a mercilessly heartless (no pun intended) system. Friends Laura Herring and David Thornton (and seemingly countless other ordinary people) do their best to help the couple raise money and soon it seems that most everything they have is on the market to be sold. Work and more hard work does not get the couple much closer to having the money they desperately need. Washington realizes that time is now of the essence. He has been pushed and pushed again and now he takes it upon himself to push back. As a last resort he literally takes the doctor (James Woods) hostage, along with other bystanders who have nothing to do with Washington's war with the hospitals and insurance organizations. Immediately cops led by Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta surround the hospital and the tenseness builds. Hungry media cronies (who would not help Washington when he had asked earlier) also try to benefit from the misery of all those that are involved with their typical exploitation tactics (one thing Jerry Springer got right). Will Washington's son be saved and is Washington actually willing to take his own life in the venture so his boy can live? "John Q" is a very impressive production from director Nick Cassavetes (showing much of the same ability his late father John showed throughout his career). Screenwriter James Kearns gets to the soul of an American society that has been blinded by economics and inefficient big-wigs who have no business possessing the careers they have. Morality has gone out the window and that "hypocritical oath" that is so prevalent in the medical field seems to be little more than a silly afterthought. "John Q" succeeds everywhere just about except in its ending. The ending is a major mistake that took away from some of the good things accomplished before the final ten minutes. Washington, arguably better here than in recent triumphs like "Training Day" (an Oscar-winning role) and "Antwone Fisher", goes to an even higher plateau here. Much like Al Pacino in the equally under-rated "Dog Day Afternoon" (an admittedly better picture), Washington dominates in a role that thrives on a claustrophobic aspect that cannot be escaped or denied within the film's running time. Duvall and Woods are also solid, as always, but Washington is the man here. Strikingly accurate when pointing the finger at things wrong with America these days, "John Q" is a thought-provoking production that will cause its audience to think and learn about sometimes forgotten aspects of human life. 4 stars out of 5.

John Q (Denzel Washington) is just an average man, he works at a factory and his wife and his son Michael are his whole world. When his son is taken ill and needs an needs an urgent heart transplant, he soon learns that his insurance won't cover the bills and he has no real hope of raising the cash himself. In an act of desperation he holds the emergency room hostage, it's all he can do to get his son the care he needs.I felt the film was fundamentally flawed, yet it was made and performed with such passion and realism, what at first seems like a far-fetched plot is soon forgotten about, and you have to just go with the flow of this emotionally charged drama.The cast is very strong, and the direction holds the story together very nicely; but most of all it achieves what it sets out to do, and that is move the audience.7/10

Denzel Washington's portrayal of a desperate dad is excellent and compelling as he struggles to find a way to get his son to be treated and operated immediately, no matter what cost. He takes the whole hospital hostage until he gets it. One may say what he is doing is bad and illegal, but at the same time he stands up to the system, and fights the odds, but hey, he's doing it for his son. I praised him when he said "I don't want to bury my son, I want my son to bury me!" In a way, he's willing to sacrifice himself to save his son. The hostages he takes, seems to support him and the mass of audiences viewing are on his side. And he also seems to be calm and friendly to them too. The ending was also perfect, and overall a great film, and not to mention the great performances from Robert Duvall, James Woods and Ray Liotta of The Good Fellas, who uses his Tommy Vercetti voice again! Gotta love that guy, gotta love that Denzel Washington, recommended for those who love him.

Come on, the other black guy pretending to be John Q and the police falling for it and arresting the wrong guy? Not quite likely.The ending was way too predictable. Of course the movie begins with the white woman dying in a car accident so we all see it coming. But still it was too predictable.Only one cop taking a shot at John in the air vent? And he messes up and get really easily subdued by John? Ow come on! And the cop only had one bullet in his weapon? So he sees John coming towards him and he does absolutely nothing with the gun in his hands? Yeah right. And when John was punching him he did absolutely nothing to put up a fight.But besides the holes in the movie and the cheesy ending I still loved the movie. 7 stars out of 10.

A very well cooked thriller, with every necessary ingredient, and a plot meant to surprise the viewer.Full of love, passion, family issues, commercial interests and politics all blended into a magnificent work of art topped with Denzel Washington's performance The film shows many aspects of life, and should be seen by all people to evaluate one's point of view on each of the parallel stories depicted.The Author takes an everyday situation and sows the seed of self - criticism in every spectator, making this more than a thriller to pass the time away.The Director plays with the characters as a Master would play his pieces on a chessboard, giving each actor enough role and having a defined objective: to checkmate the audience, and I must say he does this with very few elements, mainly dialog sequences and very few Special effects, thus turning this film into a masterpiece.Denzel Washington is the perfect choice for this film, due to his ability to play poker face situations, and his ability to play any kind of character he is offered.I do highly recommend this movie, to see it two, three or more times. Every time one sees the film, gets a new detail to one's collection and a new question to answer. Ideal for family discussion and highly recommended for teenagers

Great movie with an enthralling story and superb acting by denzel. his acting job was seriously amazing. so many intense and suspenseful scenes. they did a great job of making you root for him. so many heart-wrenching moments. there were also a couple of questionable parts and some cheesy/corny parts (about 3 viewings)

In this movie, with a great acting of Denzel Washington as John Q. I felt the deep problems of health in the USA. My cousin lives in the United States (i don't), and she told me a few complaints about this problem; in the movie i finally understood about that. I don't understand how, the most powerful country in the world does have such bad health services to it's people?. For the benefit of the Americans, i hope that they change this system soon. Denzel puts his hearth on this movie, playing a normal guy with financial problems and a hard work; the way that Denzel shows his love to his son is remarkable and demonstrates why he is one of the actual best actors in Hollywood. If you have seen Searching for David's Hearth (2004), this is as the other side of the story.About the Movie: Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald (John Q.) a husband and father with some financial problems that works almost 20 hours a day on a factory but who can't afford his expenses. John is trying to get a second job in order to earn an extra money. In the middle of this John's son Mike (Daniel E. Smith) is found to have a disease caused by a bigger than normal heart, and the doctors told him that he will die soon if they don't make a heart transplant. Here everything is hard but it gets really harder when John goes to the insurance company and get the notice that his insurance suddenly don't cover this type of procedures. John and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) start to make everything possible to collect the money (a lot of money) needed just to get his son on the donor's list, with their son dying an not much money, John desperate and takes the hospital's emergency room staff and patients hostage, demanding for to his son to be put on that list and that doctors do the transplant. The story evolves emotionally deep trough all this; in a remarkable script.About the Cast: Denzel Washington put his soul onto this role, being by far the best of all!!, Kimberly Elise does good too, but a little exaggerated sometimes, Daniel Smith as Mike is pretty poor in his acting, he didn't had to do that much but this kid (sorry) still isn't a good actor; he has years to perfect his performance. James Woods acting as Dr. Raymond Turner, as always is very good and professional, also Anne Hache as Rebbeca Payne is great and show a coldness that ripped me out. Robert Duvall acting is good but his character could have been deployed even more, for the good of the film. Ray Liotta does good; Eddie Griffin is good too as one of the characters of the emergency room (Wow, this was a great cast!) 8/10! Excellent for Denzel Washington performance!

They had us (sort of) in the palm of their hands, but the ending was a pathetic triumph of focus group indecision. Denzel Washington's character would have ended in suicide. THAT is the best ending for this film, the most realistic and the the most heart felt. The ending that the movie stuck to caters to the weak spirited Hollywoodisms that have caused most of us to be cynical about what comes from that movie making capitol.

***Starring: Denzel Washington, Kimberly Elise, Robert Duvall, and ray Liotta.John Q. is basically what the tagline says it is. You leave a father no options, you leave him no choice. That's pretty much true. Washington plays John Q. Archibald, a loving husband and caring father who must come up with 250,000 dollars to pay for his son' heart transplant or watch him die. You got to see how the hospital is unfair to John. He even states that it gives 75,000,000 dollars worth of heart transplants for free to a certain amount of people and they wouldn't give it to him from good will. John an his family are very poor and you see how hard it is for him to do this. He takes the hospital hostage to get his son a heart transplant. The movie is very solid and intelligent. There couldn't have been a better actor for John than Denzel. He is one of the greatest actors of our time and he helps prove it here. Don't listen to what Ebert says and go rent this movie.

"John Q" was the first movie with which I'm familiar that looked at the health care situation in this country. Too bad that it had so many inaccuracies. The plot of course has economically strapped John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) taking a hospital hostage to demand medical treatment for his son.But, like I said, they misrepresented a number of things too many to enumerate here. But this movie's strength is looking at the disastrous effects of letting insurance companies run our health care system. You just may want to move to Canada after seeing this (although I haven't moved there). Also starring Kimberly Elise, James Woods, Anne Heche, Robert Duvall, and Ray Liotta.

Denzil Washington certainly knows how to pick a good film and he  has picked another with John Q but i cant help but think this could have been so much better if it didnt have so much Schmaltz and and tears. Even though this film does go way overboard with sentimentality it is still a very entertaining film that you cant fail to enjoy. There are some good well known actors in this film but although their performances are fine they dont really gell as a group on screan. I would have loved to have seen some tense scenes between Ray Liotta and Denzil Washington but sadly they fail to meet on screen. A good film , maybe more suited to the person who like a weepie. 7 out of 10.

If not Washington's brilliant performance, the movie would be really awful. The story is banal and really nothing special, but you can't stay stony-faced, when you see Denzel playing his role with so many emotions. Just imagine someone else in Denzel's place - then the movie would be real crap. To sum up, watch John Q only to see Denzel's brilliant performance and nothing else.

Denzel Washington, in my opinion, is the best actor in Hollywood. This movie is another example of his range and versatility. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There were four points n the movie where I cried. I cried when the parents were told about Mike's heart, I cried when he talked to his on on the phone, I cried when he was saying goodbye, and I cried as he drove away. This movie shows us where we as people are coming to. His son needed a heart transplant, but the hospitals said no, they couldn't do it, because they didn't have the money. A little boy almost died because of our greed. And that isn't just Hollywood hogwash; that happens everyday. We have people ripping off other people, people murdering one another, all for greed. Where is this world coming to?I've read some comments on this movies message board of people calling John Q. selfish. Maybe you guys were watching a different movie than I was because he wasn't selfish. Can any of us imagine what it's like to know that our child is dying and yet we are powerless?

The movie does bring attention to the US medical and insurance system. Director and writer aren't playing in the big league and it shows. "John Q." feels like a standard TV movie with some good moments. I feel bad for some good actors in this, could've been a great movie, like this it's just okay.

Denzel Wasington Rocks! And this fact, is once again proved, with his terrific act in 'John Q'. Though a decent film, it's flaws come up evidently, but Denzel manages to hold you till the end.Denzel stars as John Quincy Archibald, a father and husband whose son is diagnosed with an enlarged heart and then finds out he cannot receive a transplant because HMO insurance will not cover it. Therefore, he decides to take a hospital full of patients hostage until the hospital puts his son's name on the recipient's list.The Idea is interesting & challenging. The film begins with a class, as the writing holds you. But, in the second hour, especially, the writing gets lose and even the culmination isn't as good as one expects it to be. Nick Cassavetes directs this emotional story, with patience. Cinematography & Editing are fine. Acting-Wise: As mentioned right from the beginning, Denzel rules the show. A performance so well-done, that it holds you, even when the writing falters. In the supporting cast, Bobby Duvall, James Woods & Kimberly Elise are efficient. Anne Heche & Ray Liotta are passable. Others lend support. On the whole, 'John Q' is interesting in parts, but what really stands tall in this film, is it's lead-star's performance.

Denzel Washington continues to prove why he is one of the best actors in the business with his performance in JOHN Q, a moving, emotional, and tension-charged drama about a family man whose son needs a heart transplant; however, due to financial problems, his insurance won't cover the cost of getting his son on the donor list so John Q decides to take hostages in the hospital until someone arranges for his son to be on the donor list.

This is now the second film that I have watched which focuses on Americas health care, or lack of it, I live in the UK where all our citizens get free health care no matter what there circumstances are, What have we come to in this world if money is greater than the sum of a human life, America and it's people should be ashamed of themselves to ever let this situation happen. The film shows this situation up very well, The acting was first rate and the film in the end is a very worthy effort. Denzil Washington does a fine job of showing how we all would feel if we were thrust into a nightmare situation that meant you could loose your child simply because you don't have enough money to pay the rip of prices of the blood sucking health system.

John Q (Denzel Washington) is just an average man, he works at a factory and his wife and his son Michael are his whole world. When his son is taken ill and needs an needs an urgent heart transplant, he soon learns that his insurance won't cover the bills and he has no real hope of raising the cash himself.

It's no secret that America has a health care crisis where about 50 million people are uninsured in this country. The story about John Q. is about his battle to save his son's life when the hospital and health insurance companies have failed his young son by declining to put his name on the heart transplant list. Two time Oscar Winner Denzel Washington does his best to bring life into this character that any other actor would not be able to do. Kimberly Elise is also admirable in her role as his wife. Anne Heche's performance as Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, is quite sickening because she plays the bureaucracy part of the role but she does it well. She can act as well. James Woods plays the rich, blood-sucking doctor who John Q. takes hostage along with other innocent bystanders and hospital staff but John Q. has a heart too. Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall have supporting roles as the police chief and hostage negotiator trying to get John Q. to end the standoff. The actions are understandable since a parent would do anything to save their child's life from known death.

Denzel Washington's portrayal of a desperate dad is excellent and compelling as he struggles to find a way to get his son to be treated and operated immediately, no matter what cost. He takes the whole hospital hostage until he gets it. One may say what he is doing is bad and illegal, but at the same time he stands up to the system, and fights the odds, but hey, he's doing it for his son.

Gotta love that guy, gotta love that Denzel Washington, recommended for those who love him.

Great movie with an enthralling story and superb acting by denzel. his acting job was seriously amazing. so many intense and suspenseful scenes. they did a great job of making you root for him. so many heart-wrenching moments. there were also a couple of questionable parts and some cheesy/corny parts (about 3 viewings)

In this movie, with a great acting of Denzel Washington as John Q. I felt the deep problems of health in the USA. My cousin lives in the United States (i don't), and she told me a few complaints about this problem; in the movie i finally understood about that. I don't understand how, the most powerful country in the world does have such bad health services to it's people?. For the benefit of the Americans, i hope that they change this system soon. Denzel puts his hearth on this movie, playing a normal guy with financial problems and a hard work; the way that Denzel shows his love to his son is remarkable and demonstrates why he is one of the actual best actors in Hollywood. If you have seen Searching for David's Hearth (2004), this is as the other side of the story.About the Movie: Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald (John Q.) a husband and father with some financial problems that works almost 20 hours a day on a factory but who can't afford his expenses.

Smith) is found to have a disease caused by a bigger than normal heart, and the doctors told him that he will die soon if they don't make a heart transplant. Here everything is hard but it gets really harder when John goes to the insurance company and get the notice that his insurance suddenly don't cover this type of procedures.

'John Q' is a film which revolves around John Quincy Archibald, a decent man who works hard and is law-abiding. But when his ten-year-old son Mike is diagnosed with a cardiac condition and desperately needs a heart transplant that the family's insurer's refuse to pay for, John is force to take matters into his own hands. With his son weakening, John takes the staff and patients of a hospital hostage as he demands doctors perform the surgery.Denzel Washington plays John and, as usual, gives a very effecting performance that shows the strength and determination of a father's love without descending into schmaltz. Kimberly Elise, in her role as John's wife Denise nicely compliments his portrayal as a wife who wants a quiet life but will support her husband in anything if that is what it takes to save their son. The film also has strong support from Robert Duvall, as the hostage negotiator who sympathises with John but has a job to do, and James Woods in an uncharacteristically role as a spineless doctor who is more interested in his own life than the patients.The actual storyline was a bit too overly-sentimental at times but only someone with a hard heart couldn't be moved by John's plight. 'John Q' does highlight a number of ethical questions, such as how far should a parent go to save their child and, ultimately, how could such a tragedy happen in the twenty-first century America that a child is denied a heart transplant purely because their family can't afford it? Living in the UK, we have the National Health Service, which is far from perfect, but at least parents wouldn't have to take the law into their own hands to ensure their child is given the surgery they need to live. Despite the rather happy resolution to the film, there is still a sadness to the story because this sort of thing probably does happen despite America being so rich.'John Q' is a well-made thriller for those who also enjoy dramas and family-based films but it's also one which should be forced down the throats of every politician across the globe about why adequate health care should be provided for all, not matter what their financial status is.

They had us (sort of) in the palm of their hands, but the ending was a pathetic triumph of focus group indecision. Denzel Washington's character would have ended in suicide. THAT is the best ending for this film, the most realistic and the the most heart felt. The ending that the movie stuck to caters to the weak spirited Hollywoodisms that have caused most of us to be cynical about what comes from that movie making capitol.

You just may want to move to Canada after seeing this (although I haven't moved there). Also starring Kimberly Elise, James Woods, Anne Heche, Robert Duvall, and Ray Liotta.

Denzel Washington is a hard-working blue collar father whose son needs a heart transplant but who has run out of money and can't afford further medical treatment. He impulsively takes over Hope Memoral Hospital in Chicago, calling himself "John Q." (as in "John Q. Public"), holds the minimal weekend staff hostage and demands that his son be put on the list of recipients for a donated heart by a doctor (Anne Heche). Outside, the police (Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta) surround the place, a thousand guns aimed at the hospital, and try variously to negotiate with him or to snipe him. No donor being available, Washington decides that since he and his son have been tissue-typed and match, Washington will blow his own brains out to provide the necessary heart. Lots of arguments follow, involving chiefly one of the hostages who happens to be a cardiac surgeon (James Woods). As in a miracle, a young woman with a matching heart dies and the donation comes through just as Washington is wrestling with the damned safety on the automatic he's holding to his head. Whew! A close call, I'd say.Well, it has a truly competent professional cast, no doubt about it, and they play it at par. Also quite good in a small role is Paul Johansson. Nick Cassavetes' direction is functional but no more than that.The movie's up against the wall though. Inevitably we're dealing with de Maupassant's "Boule de Souif," in which a small group of people of varying tastes and backgrounds are squeezed together under pressure and little dramas play out between them. In a case like this the success depends as much on the script as on anything else. Given that it's going to look a little mechanical, and given that none if any of the characters can be given full development, whether the film satisfies or not hangs on what the characters say."Stagecoach" did a fine job, and so did "Twelve Angry Men" and "Dog Day Afternoon," so it's not an impossible task. The characters here are mostly predictably stereotyped. Among the police, we have the negotiator in conflict with the exterminator. We have conflict within the hospital between the pragmatist doctor and the humanist doctor. Among the waiting-room patients we have the noble black couple about to have their first child and the cowardly slapaho sniveling braggart of a white guy. The police sniper is fat, sweaty, sneering, and ugly.And they pretty much stay the way they are. There is a good deal of preaching that goes on. HMOs come in for a good deal of abuse. We know immediately that the chief of police, Liotta, is a simple-minded goon because he shows up at the "hostage situation" in full uniform, dripping with decorations, shaking hands with the press, telling everyone what to do because he knows best -- "How do you think I got THESE?", he shouts at Duvall's negotiator, pointing to the four stars on his shoulder. Oh -- the press. I forgot about the press. I leave it up to you to guess whether the model presented to us is the same as that in the "Die Hard" films (get the scoop at all costs, and make sure my hair looks good) or the idealistic responsible model the fifth estate would like us to swear to. The film overall takes a worthwhile story about a social issue and turns it into and almost unbroken string of sentimental clichés. There are some good things going for the film, despite the weaknesses of the script. A few exchanges stand out. As in "Dog Day Afternoon," when the crowd cheers Al Pacino, there is a crowd here that goes wild with applause when Denzel Washington appears at the hospital door. But Duvall puts it in perspective. "You're just the cause for today. Tomorrow you'll be forgotten." Anne Heche, the hard-boiled doctor, is given a good line too. If we give in to Washington's demands today, tomorrow the hospitals will be filled with gun-toting loonies. Why is it a good line, when nothing more is made of it? Because although it sounds like common sense there is not the slightest evidence that it's true. Our values are filled with such axioms. We never negotiate with terrorists. We only negotiate from a position of strength. Give 'em an inch and they'll take a mile. Skinnerian reenforcement works well with puppies and rats under controlled conditions. But does it work outside the lab? Probably, in a general way, but what's really at stake when we refuse negotiation -- reenforcement or our own pride? Should life and death depend on a notion so simple that it can be put on a bumper sticker? The film isn't entirely original or gripping, despite the tension inherent in the situation, but I'd be willing to rate it above average if it just makes us think a little more about that primitive belief.It's necessary to add that this is not a partisan liberal tract. The economics of HMOs is briefly and cogently explained and they come out looking bad. Not because they're evil but because that's the way health plans were structured. They were a social problem years before they became a political issue.

Denzil Washington certainly knows how to pick a good film and he  has picked another with John Q but i cant help but think this could have been so much better if it didnt have so much Schmaltz and and tears. Even though this film does go way overboard with sentimentality it is still a very entertaining film that you cant fail to enjoy. There are some good well known actors in this film but although their performances are fine they dont really gell as a group on screan. I would have loved to have seen some tense scenes between Ray Liotta and Denzil Washington but sadly they fail to meet on screen. A good film , maybe more suited to the person who like a weepie. 7 out of 10.

Once again Denzel Washington has outdone himself in this delightful movie. I am getting spoiled when ever I go to see one of his pictures, as his depth is constantly great.  Mr. Casavettes does a fine directing job in this poinient story, but with bits of humor thrown in to break up the tension. This may not be academy award material, but it certainly is worth the price of a ticket.  Go see it, you won't regret it.

If not Washington's brilliant performance, the movie would be really awful. The story is banal and really nothing special, but you can't stay stony-faced, when you see Denzel playing his role with so many emotions. Just imagine someone else in Denzel's place - then the movie would be real crap. To sum up, watch John Q only to see Denzel's brilliant performance and nothing else.

Denzel Washington, in my opinion, is the best actor in Hollywood. This movie is another example of his range and versatility. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There were four points n the movie where I cried. I cried when the parents were told about Mike's heart, I cried when he talked to his on on the phone, I cried when he was saying goodbye, and I cried as he drove away. This movie shows us where we as people are coming to. His son needed a heart transplant, but the hospitals said no, they couldn't do it, because they didn't have the money. A little boy almost died because of our greed. And that isn't just Hollywood hogwash; that happens everyday. We have people ripping off other people, people murdering one another, all for greed. Where is this world coming to?I've read some comments on this movies message board of people calling John Q. selfish. Maybe you guys were watching a different movie than I was because he wasn't selfish. Can any of us imagine what it's like to know that our child is dying and yet we are powerless?

I enjoyed this film. As others point out, the plot is simple. Son needs a transplant. Father takes hospital hostage to try to get it. But a simple plot is not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes you don't want to have to interpret everything.I thought the characterizations of the little family were so sweet. The trivial spats of everyday life earlier in the film. Later, both parents fighting together, willing to do anything to save the child. Some contrived, but heart-wrenching, moments showing each parent's love for the child. Denzel W. gave a very real performance as the decent, hard-working, blue-collar dad. Yes, he was almost perfect. Yes, the bad people were uniformly bad. Yet, the movie still works because of the strong performances of Denzel W. and the woman who played his wife.

I remember when this movie came out there was a lot of criticism towards it. I can honestly say that the only good things I heard about about it was these positive reviews on Amazon. I was determined to see it and I was finally able to see it. Guess what? It isn't as bad as these critics say it is but then again the movie going public are usually made up of morons.Premise: John Q Archibald's son passes out during a baseball game. Once taken to the hospital John and his wife find out that their son has an enlarged heart. John goes through great lengths to get money just to get his son's name on the heart donor's list only to get screwed over by the same hospital that was supposed to look out for him. Down on his last luck, John Q holds the whole hospital hostage at gunpoint until his son's medical needs are met.Opinion: This movie is very touching as well as a sad testament to the issue involving healthcare. Many people bash the movie because they figure that the way John Q handled his son's situation was extreme but if you were in his shoes and handled that situation with passiveness then you deserve to get bullied by these corporate warthogs for being docile! Everybody with the exception of the ham that beats his girl fits into this movie perfectly. Eddie Griffin provided brief moments of levity, James Woods was great as the doctor who had to be forced into compromising and John Q is one of Denzel's finest performances. The movie has a happy as well as a sad ending but I wont spoil it for those of you who have yet to see it. They say that the message of the movie was hammered onto the audience but in a world full of proud-to-be-stupid people, the only way to get a message so serious across is to beat it into their thick heads. I'll part by saying that not every movie that is critically panned is bad and not every critically acclaimed movie is good. See it for yourself.

The movie does bring attention to the US medical and insurance system. Director and writer aren't playing in the big league and it shows. "John Q." feels like a standard TV movie with some good moments. I feel bad for some good actors in this, could've been a great movie, like this it's just okay.

Fact: There are so many medical errors in this movie that it's hard to take seriously in terms of plausibility, especially if you have a clinical background.It's also a fact that the movie is well-acted and an enjoyable watch. Denzel Washington is a national treasure, and Robert Duvall, James Woods, and Ann Heche deliver solid performances. Almost every actor in JOHN Q brings something of value to the table.The flaws in the American medical system are well known to everyone regardless of their ideological bent. The fact that, at it's best, it's the world's finest and most sophisticated health care is not reasonably disputable. The fact that this excellence is too often available only to those of means is also not a matter of dispute, both before the ACA when this movie was made and since its passage.JOHN Q delivers this message forcefully, but to what end? Everyone wants quality health care for all; our leaders simply can't agree upon or find a way to get there. Nevertheless, a bit of preaching to the choir is OK once in a while as a reminder, and here, it's heavy handed while stopping short of being overbearing.JOHN Q is a problematic film. JOHN Q is a worthwhile film. Both statements can be -- and are -- true.As an honest reviewer, given its many flaws, I can't give JOHN Q more than 5 stars ... but I sure as heck want to.
