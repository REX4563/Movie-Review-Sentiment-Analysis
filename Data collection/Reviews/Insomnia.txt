As said in my reviews for his masterpiece 'Memento' and the fascinating 'The Prestige', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Insomnia' is not one of Nolan's best films, but not his worst. For me it's somewhere in the middle if ranking his films, 'Memento' being his best and, while with a lot of impressive elements, 'Interstellar' being the one that impressed least. It shows fidelity to the Norwegian original, but doesn't go so far that it's a pale retread, in a way that is summed up very well by Roger Ebert.Nolan directs with impeccable style and sense of atmosphere, as well as an ability to tell a potentially convoluted story with clarity without resorting to excess and over-ambition. Much of 'Insomnia' is exceptionally well made, while beautiful Alaska has rarely been more oppressive as well while the cinematography has grit and class. David Julyan's music score is not quite as complex as that for 'Memento', but has a very effective eeriness.The script is tight and thoughtful, and the story, filled with neat twists and turns, is hugely compelling and atmospheric, never being too simple but complex enough to still be understandable and be respectful to the viewer. The cat and mouse stuff could have been predictable and convoluted but executed in masterly hair-raising but also quiet tension.Performances are all strong across the board. While underused somewhat, Martin Donovan and especially Hilary Swank are great here. It is however Al Pacino and Robin Williams who are even better. Pacino gives perhaps his best performance since 'Heat' and he has to me definitely not been on this amount of blistering form as he is in 'Insomnia'. Williams is cast against type, and he plays a genuinely terrifying character with menace but also dignity and restraint.Flaws are only a couple, with the film ending too conveniently and some of the editing being a touch too jumpy.All in all, a gripping film and hardly a sleeper. 8/10 Bethany Cox

A veteran detective with skeletons in his closet, whisked away to a foreign land (for whatever reason) - it's been done many times. Most of the time, the "is he dirty or isn't he?" routine is frustrating ("Black Rain", "Boom Town", "Rising Sun", etc.). BUt it's different with "Insomnia"; you pretty much know the main character is a dirty cop, so it's really about the walls closing in, which is actually refreshing. And it adds levels.Other than that, it's the talent of the main cast that makes this fresh. Pacino, Swank and Williams are all terrific (although Williams is perfectly at home with quietly deranged; it's beyond creepy). And Pacino is well-suited for a guy who can't get any sleep. He makes run-down look easy.7/10

There is a scene in the original Insomnia where the protagonist (there played by Stellan Skarsgard, in this remake by Al Pacino), desperate to obtain a damaged bullet to tamper with the evidence of an ongoing investigation, approaches a dog in a dark alley and kills it. The remake mimics the scene, except the dog shot by Pacino is dead already. In a nutshell, this shows the difference between the two movies.Before this sounds like some kind of anti-remake crusade, I'll say Nolan's movie surpasses the Norwegian original from many points of view.Performances are stronger, led by a nicely low-key turn by Pacino, who reminds us what a great thespian he can be when he isn't hamming it up. The character of the killer is more developed, here aptly played by Robin Williams in one of those creepy clear-eyed, smug-faced turns of his. Dialogues are crisp without getting too cozy, cinematography makes an interesting use of colors and light.So, where does this thriller - focused on two veteran Homicide detectives searching for a killer in Alaska - goes wrong? It erases most of the moral ambiguity of the original. Skarsgard's dark protagonist was genuinely unsettling - a lost man who quickly sinks to ignominious lows to cover up his own mistakes. Here, Pacino is flawed in a much safer and more traditional way. The extent this remake goes to soften his main character into something more palatable to a mass audience is actually rather amusing in a meta kind of way.The greatest betrayal, though, is the ending, with the martyred hero redeemed by his own blood who passes the torch to Swank's young idealistic cop with a smile and a moral lesson. From the director of the dangerous and abrasive Memento, it's a real shame.7,5/10

I was really looking forward to this film, and I'm glad to say that I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  First of all, I was glad to see Al Pacino on screen again.  It seems like it's been a while since I've seen him on screen.  I think the last film he was in was "Any Given Sunday."  Pacino yet again delivers a brilliant performance, strapping the audience in for a wild ride through the emotionally scarred mind of Detective Will Dormer.  It seemed like I could feel his every emotion throughout the course of the movie.  Because this is a character-driven story that revolves around Dormer, his pain, anguish and guilt on account of accidentally taking his partner's life, constant insomnia and subsequent threats by his nemesis, played by Robin Williams as a writer of trashy detective novels who's fascinated by Dormer and blackmails him by threatening to spill out the secret of Dormer shooting his partner.  As for Robin Williams, he is fully convincing as the reclusive novelist/murderer of a 17-year-old girl.  I suspected, from the trailers, that he'd play a serial killer.  I wouldn't exactly classify his character as a serial killer, but he is the antagonist and a murderer and Williams plays the role perfectly, never underplaying it and never overplaying it.  He could've went over-the-top, playing a totally ruthless killer who cackles at the thought of murdering someone in cold blood.  Though he's not our sympathetic character, you do feel sympathy for him at times.  And I like how the story creates this little cat-and-mouse game between the two characters, each one plagued by skeletons in the closet.  Oscar-winner Hilary Swank delivers another fine performance, and I was stunned to see how amazingly attractive she looks, after having seen her gender-bending role as Brandon Teena in "Boys Don't Cry."
Christopher Nolan is the acclaimed director of "Memento" and he scores yet again, with this beautifully constructed thriller.  I was intrigued from start to finish.  Nolan's use of lighting is dark and murky, wonderfully setting the noirish tone.  Nolan shows great promise as an up-and-coming director, and with a good outlet he can possibly become the next Kubrick. I greatly look forward to seeing his next project, whenever that may be.I recommend "Insomnia" to anyone who loved Nolan's previous "Memento" or anyone who simply enjoys a great, multi-faceted mystery/thriller that will keep you guessing at every turn.  I think it's too early to vote this movie as one of the best films of 2002, but it's a possible candidate.  We don't see too many "great" films anymore, and whenever they're out there it's good to take advantage.My score:  9 (out of 10)

Who doesn't love Al Pacino? Anyone.....Come on..... there at least should be one hater! Guess there is not. Al Pacino is loved by everyone who has seen him as "Michael Vito Corleone" in The Godfather Trilogy or the ruthless "Tony Montana" in Scarface. These films were the highlights of his career and even though he isn't as memorable as Will Dormer in Insomnia, it is hard not to give him an honorable mention. Insomnia is referred to as a "Cat and Mouse" thriller and it proved that it is one because of the whole chase thing between Will Dormer, a cop, and a local writer who goes by the name of Walter Finch, a man who is under the suspicion of killing a teen. This is proved even more when there is an actual ground chase between them two on the logs in the flowing river. That scene was full of heart pounding action and added a bit of intrigue that made you appreciate the film a little bit more. The film would have been unknown to me if there weren't the three Oscar winners, Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank that made this thriller for what it is, also if Christopher Nolan hadn't directed it. He is truly a great director. Steven Spielberg has to watch out for the might of Nolan. Al Pacino was absolute and admirable in Insomnia therefore making him the best actor in the whole film. His role as a tough cop was fascinating and hypnotizing. Robin Williams, who portrays Walter Finch, was not as great as Al's however he still doesn't disappoint. This is not Robin Williams best role but it MIGHT be his most evilest role in his "Evil Trilogy". Hilary Swank's character Ellie Burr made you think that she was unnecessary but as the film reaches its climax you realize that she plays an important part. Swank's performance could not rival against her other roles in "Million Dollar Baby" or "Boy's don't Cry" however she is agreeable but not fun to watch. The films chilly, or spooky, atmosphere is the best in any movie, I have ever seen so far. It just makes the films setting really home-sweet-home. The scenery at the beginning was beautiful as the plane flew over the ice and glaciers of Alaska.In Nightmute, Alaska, seventeen year old resident Kay Connell is found murdered. As a favor to the local Nightmute police chief, two Los Angeles Robbery Homicide police detectives, Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart, are called in to assist in the investigation. Although renowned in the police world, both Dormer and Eckhart are facing some professional issues back in Los Angeles. In Nightmute, Dormer has a major case of insomnia due to a combination of the incessant midnight sun and from a secret he is carrying. This insomnia is causing him to be delusional. Something he is not dreaming about is that the murderer has contacted him, informing him all about the murder and the fact that he knows everything that is going on with Dormer. They begin a symbiotic relationship in keeping secrets for each individual's benefit. But ambitious young local detective, Ellie Burr, might piece the story together on her own.

Christopher Nolan follows the flawless MEMENTO with this, another one-word title film and another inventive, superb effort. Based on a Norwegian movie (which I haven't, as yet, seen), this tells the oft-told tale of a world-weary cop vs. a nasty and particularly slimy killer. What makes it special is the script – very believable and down-to-earth – and the characters, who are so realistically drawn that you can easily believe they are living, breathing people. The setting of the icy, desolate Alaskan town is very good indeed, combined with excellent cinematography which brings out every characteristic of the location and makes it feel really unique. Nolan shoots his film expertly, mixing in some fine chase and action sequences (the log run is brilliantly conceived) with the heavier, more dramatic moments.Al Pacino is fine in the role of the ageing, flawed cop. Sure it's a performance we've all seen before but he makes it extra special with his singular powers of method acting and realism. You feel tired just looking at his weary, end-of-the-road cop. The supporting cast are all fine but it's Robin Williams who really steals the show as the killer, Finch. Williams is nasty, slimy, villainous, creepy, and totally scary, a mundane and quiet little man who's prone to bursts of a violent psychopathic nature. The film remains unpredictable throughout, letting the suspense build gradually as the cat-and-mouse storyline increases the tension, before ending in a sudden burst of violence and excitement. Magnificent stuff, sadly all too rare these days in Hollywood but a reminder of what a good director, a good script and a good cast can really do.

As is evident by now, anyone who has enjoyed Christopher Nolan's movies would, most probably, Insomnia at the bottom of their favorite from Nolan. While people who don't enjoy the Nolan brand of cinema will mark Insomnia as their favorite from Nolan. Simply because, this movie is a remake and while has many of Nolan's signature styles, it is not as evident as it is in his other superior works (IMHO).Nolan's movies (from Following to Inception) is built around the concept of duality. Insomnia has a similar theme running through it, that of Al Pacino's character living the life of a honest role-model while still doing things reprehensible, thus showing two sides of life. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are in supreme form and the cinematography by Wally Pfister is gorgeous. But the 'quickness' that is associated with other Nolan movies (even BB) is visibly absent in this one. It is by no means a bad movie, but the slow burn of the thriller does dampen the effect. Not a must watch, but an intriguing thriller that well matches its Swedish inspiration.

Insomnia is almost a collage of several other mystery films (namely Se7en) tied into one, but not distinctively. Although it wasn't completely repetitive, it was as cliché as detective work goes, and the movie didn't stand out one way or another. Whether it's the elusive murderer on the loose or the mentally plagued cop who's trying his best, this movie is predictable and lacks ingenuity. Accompanying the lack of creativity, the prime actors and actresses had average performances and the emotional conviction in the roles was often lacking. A straight plot followed by routine dialogue made Insomnia rather mundane and an effort to watch. Although there were particular exciting scenes, they were rather short and sparse. The resources were there, but execution was a miss.Whether it's L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects, Se7en or any other great mystery movie, these all had a strong emotional attachment that hook viewers into truly empathizing with the protagonists and mystery at hand. Unfortunately in Insomnia, it's almost like you already know the fate of the characters, and still don't care.

Will Dormer is a veteran LA detective, recognized for his investigative skills, noted by his peers as a good cop.I was expecting a typical detective story with lots of puzzles and thrilling mysteries, hoping to see why Will Dormer is acclaimed for his job. But this is not really the focal point of the story. Just around 25 minutes in the movie, you'll already see a major lead about the suspect.While I understand that the story begins after the foggy beach chase, I was left wanting for more build up and mystery in the investigation. It really felt rushed.The first encounter with Walter Finch at the rocky beach put me in the edge of my seat. It's a pretty good cat and mouse chase but the real surprise is the accidental shooting of Hap that really sent me in shock.I'm not really a fan of the ending. I think it's predictable and too safe for an interesting lead character. And Ellie Burr, towards the end of the film, suddenly became too soft for Will that she tried to cover up the truth for him.Insomnia is a character-driven, psychological thriller. It explores the character's moral judgement on how they will navigate their way through difficult choices where their principles are at stake.Robin Williams as Walter Finch doesn't appeal to me that much but I love every bit of Al Pacino's acting as Will Dormer. Those sleep-deprived eyes, hunchback posture, and piercing stares look so authentic you can feel his weariness. Overall, it's a decent film but I'm not obsessed with it.

Riveting and interesting thriller with brilliant performances. Two Los Angeles homicide detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are dispatched to a northern town where the sun doesn't set to investigate the methodical murder of a local teen. To Ellie (Hilary Swank) the rookie assigned to assist the detective Dormer's a hero. But she doesn't knows Dorner is investigated by Internal Affairs. Poor Dormer,however, he's really disoriented in every scene, no longer distinguishes so clearly between means and motive, cause and effect. He who sins, does not sleep ! .Days never end. Nightmares are real. No one is innocent. Don't close your eyes. A tough cop. A brilliant killer. An unspeakable crime. A murder investigator has been brought in on a special case, sleep deprived, he makes a horrible mistake which is discovered by the killer he has been hunting !.This taut psychological thriller contains intrigue, action, shootouts , suspense, twists and turns. If all this may sound familiar, it's because Hillary Seitz's subtle script improves on the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name: Insomnia by Erik Skjoldbjærg with Stellan Skarsgård, Sverre Anker Ousdal, Gisken Armand. Concerning a twisted premise: when a killing takes place and covers it up, a double sided game of cat-and-mouse ensues. Despite its linear script, the movie is very recognisable the work of the sharp, probing intelligence that gave ¨Following¨ and ¨Memento¨. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the unconventional progression of the storyline and the various twists within the script. While it succeeds as an extremely stylish, gripping thriller, it's also another of the director's takes on life as narrative. Uniformly excellent performance especially from Al Pacino and Robin Williams , lends welcome nuance and depth to the ethical investigation while furnishing the drama with dark, telling ironies and intriguing ambiguity. There are few actors as Pacino who can keep a straight face, yet still manage to convey complex emotion, and he is one of them. He walked through his scenes with somberness and really powerful, yet weary. Pacino and Williams are well accompanied by a magnificent support cast, such as: Hilary Swank, Paul Dooley, Nicky Katt, Maura Tierney, Jonathan Jackson, Katharine Isabelle Larry Holden, Jay Brazeau, Lorne Cardinal, Ian Tracey, among others.It displays thrilling and suspenseful musical score by David Julyan . As well as cloudy and evocative cinematography by Wally Pfister , Nolan's regular, shot on several locations in Britannia Beach, Columbia Británica, Canadá, Port Alberni, Columbia Británica, Canadá, Hyder, Valdez, Alaska .

First off, Christopher Nolan is one of my biggest influences when it comes to film and screen writing. With films such as Following and Memento, both of which reached cult following levels, he is well on his way to a successful Hollywood career. Then, today came, his 3rd film was released, Insomnia. Based on a 1997 Norwegian film written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg, Insomnia is a true work of art in the world of film.Christopher Nolan takes all that was the 1997 film, and brings it to the next level, using his own style of directing, a musical score with shades of Memento, and an all star cast. Al Pacino and Robin Williams pulls out the greatest performances of their careers in the past decade, if not in their ENTIRE careers in my eyes. Pacino once again excels in the role of master dective, while Williams takes this chance to show his "dark side", and he does it so well. I can only hope that this is a rebirth of Robin Williams, and as it stands with his upcoming film One Hour Photo (which he once again plays a dark, psychotic role), it seems to be just that! Hilary Swank also pulls out what is the greatest role of her career.Insomnia brings you in as an audience, with it's perfectly woven plot, with a film noir feel to it, just as Nolan's first two films. It is a rollercoster ride of drama and suspense as you watch Al Pacino from the very beginning unravel, and the rest of the story and his past catches up with him. I can not say much more about it, as I do not wish to spoil anything about if for you, but I do want to say this... ...go see it, right now, and enjoy. If you love crime/mystery/drama films with that wonderful Film Noir feel to it, you will love this film. If that isn't your thing, then the performances of the three main actors are worth the price of a ticket in itself. Finally I just want to say, that Insomnia proves once and for all that Christopher Nolan will indeed be a force to reckoned with in Hollywood. I've said it before, and I'll say it again... ...Christopher Nolan is well on his way to becoming the Hollywood legend which he proves he is capable of becoming.

The film Insomnia, based on an earlier Norwegian film, is an almost winner.By acclaimed directed Christopher Nolan, (Memento,) this is a bet that almost, but not quite, pays off, in the sense of waiting for the "other shoe to drop." It is not so much a murder mystery as it is a character study, but, as with the rest of the film, it's almost but not quite that, also.Al Pacino is Detective Will Dormer, who has been summoned to Nightmute, Alaska by an old friend to help solve the murder of a 17-year-old girl. Pacino is a man on the verge of many things: retirement, age, and moral collapse, as we learn early on. He and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are being investigated by Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles. On the way to Alaska, Hap informs Dormer that he intends to "cut a deal" and take whatever comes of it. This doesn't please Dormer in the slightest, and he gives the impression he'll fight the investigation, and his partner's selling-out, but fate has a different idea. Early in the investigation, Dormer accidentally shoots Hap. With his partner now dead, Dormer has nothing more to fear from IA. Or so he imagines.Enter Walter Finch, played by Robin Williams; he is the main suspect in the murder, and has also seen the shooting of Hap, or so he informs Dormer. Now the plot will weave around these two, almost exclusively, as they play their game of manipulation and one-upmanship. And here's where the film begins to lose its own compass.First, I had a bit of a problem with the fact that the two detectives from L.A. were in Alaska to begin with. Supposedly, this is an official trip, but I have trouble believing that the Los Angeles Police Dept would send two of its people to Alaska for such a mundane reason. Yes, it's murder, but the ease with which these two solve the case and pinpoint the murderer is just so fast that it's hard to believe the Alaskans couldn't have done the same, and done it sooner. Second, the character of Ellie Burr, (Hilary Swank) who has made a study of Detective Dormer's work for her academy thesis, is just a little too worshipful. And what a coincidence that she should be there in Nightmute, involved in this case. It's a little too contrived, in my opinion. Hilary Swank, a wonderful actress, is overqualified for the wide-eyed wonderment she portrays here. There's not enough depth in her character to hold your interest.Third, we never really get a chance to pick apart Finch, Robin Williams' character. We only know a little about him, but nothing essential, and nothing that adds to our understanding of why he committed this foul deed in the first place, or what is driving him to do what he does. We come into this situation, "in the middle" and leave it pretty much the same way when the movie ends. There's a solution, but no enlightenment.
There are two other interesting characters that also tease us into wanting to know more, but never give up any information beyond that: the hotel desk clerk, played by Maura Tierney, and Police Chief Nyback, played by Paul Dooley, are both characters I would have liked to see developed into "whole" people. Especially Tierney's character, who says one of the most fascinating lines in the film, something about how people in Alaska are either born there or are there because they've escaped something a lot worse. With a lead-in like that, it was a shame not to follow up on it.Mostly, we are treated (?) to extreme closeups of Pacino as he spirals down into his insomniac, ethical black-hole, and teasers of the menace Robin Williams might actually be hiding underneath that parka. In neither case is it enough, or satisfying, and as the film winds down into its inevitable conclusion, we are left with a hollow feeling that we just didn't get enough. We can draw conclusions, but they are not the point; the point is what makes these things happen in the first place, and that's a question that goes unanswered. Additionally, there are some recurring cut-scenes of the murder itself, which are never explained or illuminated. They appear as memory flashes, but we never see them in their entirety, which is extremely annoying. Overall, the film looked as if it were originally a lot longer, and was edited down to fit its current time. If that's not the case, then it's just too minimalist to make a satisfying story. The plot is, or could be, a very good one, with a bit more explanation. There is a lot of atmospheric buildup, but in the end, not much suspense or tension for the viewer. The characters tease us with development, never quite making us understand them, or their motives; they feel thinly painted, and shadowy. Not a tour-de-force for director Nolan, though Pacino and Williams give their parts all the nuances they can.I left wanting more.

I erred in giving into temptation to watch the original Norwegian "Insomnia" on IFC just a couple of weeks before seeing this Hollywood re-make directed by indie-credible "Memento" Christopher Nolan with a very effective Academy Award-winning cast.The original movie had a tiny budget and also an excellent cast, led by the terrific Swede Stellan Skarsgård, growing as pale as that relentless sunshine during the course of the film; the usually haggard-looking Al Pacino interprets his insomnia visually through an ever more haggard face.Though the original film isn't given as the source material until well into the closing credits, this follows the main thrust of the story closely. The changes, though, are both subtle and significant and intriguingly as American as Sam Spade when the mise en scene gets moved to Alaska (actually shot in Vancouver). Significantly, there is less sex and more morality.Hilary Swank's character is more naive than her counterpart; Martin Donovan's character's role is more central to the story and, of course, Robin Williams gets more screen time than his original counterpart, as the conflict is less in the lead's mind and more on the screen as a duel. The plot twists are done differently so I shamefully got confused between the two movies.While not as overwhelming as the original, I do think this version should rank right up with the great detective/cop-does-the-right-thing movies, and the plot makes more sense than "The Big Sleep."(originally written 6/16/2002)

I loved the cop working with the killer. He's playing both side trying to save himself and stop the killer. And the added element of the endless day light was another great ingredient.Pacino as usual gives an outstanding performance. He made me tired just watching him. He did great at his progression of looking more and more tired. And he does these little things you don't normally see actors do. I don't know if I can explain it. But he seems comfortable to the point that he's outside the box and it adds reality.Hilary Swank was great as the young doe eyed cop. She had that look of enthusiasm and optimism in her eyes. And the way that she always looked at Pacino. She was starting out and he was ending. You can see it in both of their faces.Robin Williams was a different but great choice. He's obviously a good actor, we've known that. But we've never seen him like this before. He has some kind of sadness in his face and voice. Something that evokes your sympathy. You didn't want to believe the he was a killer and wanted to believe his story that the murder wasn't his fault. But then his calm passivity becomes creepy and scary. You know what he did the whole time and the fact that he's this calm about it makes him scary.This has two of the best/inventive chases I've ever seen. The foggy beach and the logs in the water. Not only does it utilize the area but it's different. Chasing someone in the fog where you can't see a thing and the killer could be right in front of you is good suspense. And on the beach with big rocks so you have to keep looking where you're going.The logs in the water is everything dangerous: fast, always moving, with the threat of drowning and the ground is unstable. When he falls in the sound was very good at conveying the power of the crashing logs.This was also a good remake. They took the story, made it their own and Americanized it. I hate it when a remake doesn't add anything new. If you're going to make it in a different country, make it in a different country. Don't do what "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" did. The Norwegian one is very good and worth watching.You know you're a good director when this is your least good movie. Of course at the time this was from the guy that did "Memento." We had no idea what the future held for this great director's career. His talent is evident here. Any director could have made this movie but he really added those extra touches to make it stand out

INSOMNIA is not only the third film of acclaimed director Christopher Nolan (his first two were FOLLOWINGS and MEMENTO), but also a film that is able to intertwine the acting talents of three Academy Award winners.  Al Pacino plays a celebrated cop who is asked to work on the case of a murdered girl in Alaska.  Hilary Swank plays the local law enforcement who has her eyes on making a big case.  Robin Williams plays a troubled Alaskan writer.  Without giving anything away, INSOMNIA is definitely worth it.  Some may see it, and be disappointed.  One way to steer away from this failure is think of INSOMNIA as a psychological thriller rather than a "Shoot 'em up" thriller. INSOMNIA is story about loyalty and human emotion.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is thrill-packed, but let's just say--You don't need blood and gore to make the audience members be on the edge of their seats (which I was). INSOMNIA hits all of its points including acting, directing, screenwriting, and cinematography.  It's a first class thriller with great characters.  On a side note...Pacino is worthy of an Oscar for his performance, Williams is equally excellent, and Swank also deserves recognition for complete scope of acting.  A job well done by these three actors, and especially the man behind the curtain, Christopher Nolan!

One doesn't expect to feel claustrophobic in Alaska, but that's exactly the effect when watching "Insomnia". The primary story is about the police investigation of the murder of a high-school girl in a small Alaskan town. Through the pull of old acquaintances and political necessity, two LA homicide detectives (Pacino and Martin Donovan) are dispatched to the scene to help the locals. The political necessity concerns a graft investigation in which the two LA detectives are key suspects. One is thinking of copping a plea, so they are spirited out of LA to avoid the investigative light. Then they find themselves in the 24-hour day of the Alaskan summer where the two plot lines collide; the murder investigation and the graft. And what a collision it is. The insomnia of the title is suffered by the Pacino character, who can't sleep during the movie's 7-day span. And each day his eyes are more sunken, he's groggier, less focused. This parallels his descent into guilt, remorse, and desperation. But to provide any more details would be to give away key plot elements. "Insomnia" is gripping and it's best to see the movie cold.The acting, especially Robin Williams as the key suspect in the child slaying, is top notch. Williams is made for these roles, he should kiss the suck-up feel-good stuff goodbye for good. The photography is excellent, Alaska never looked so ominous, and the direction delivers the goods. Highly recommended.

As said in my reviews for his masterpiece 'Memento' and the fascinating 'The Prestige', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Insomnia' is not one of Nolan's best films, but not his worst. For me it's somewhere in the middle if ranking his films, 'Memento' being his best and, while with a lot of impressive elements, 'Interstellar' being the one that impressed least. It shows fidelity to the Norwegian original, but doesn't go so far that it's a pale retread, in a way that is summed up very well by Roger Ebert.Nolan directs with impeccable style and sense of atmosphere, as well as an ability to tell a potentially convoluted story with clarity without resorting to excess and over-ambition. Much of 'Insomnia' is exceptionally well made, while beautiful Alaska has rarely been more oppressive as well while the cinematography has grit and class. David Julyan's music score is not quite as complex as that for 'Memento', but has a very effective eeriness.The script is tight and thoughtful, and the story, filled with neat twists and turns, is hugely compelling and atmospheric, never being too simple but complex enough to still be understandable and be respectful to the viewer. The cat and mouse stuff could have been predictable and convoluted but executed in masterly hair-raising but also quiet tension.Performances are all strong across the board. While underused somewhat, Martin Donovan and especially Hilary Swank are great here. It is however Al Pacino and Robin Williams who are even better. Pacino gives perhaps his best performance since 'Heat' and he has to me definitely not been on this amount of blistering form as he is in 'Insomnia'. Williams is cast against type, and he plays a genuinely terrifying character with menace but also dignity and restraint.Flaws are only a couple, with the film ending too conveniently and some of the editing being a touch too jumpy.All in all, a gripping film and hardly a sleeper. 8/10 Bethany Cox

I didn't know that 'Insomnia' was based on a Norwegian movie of the same title. Otherwise, I would have watched the original film first. What convinced me to watch this one was the cast that included three super-talented actors and the director Christopher Nolan ('loved his 'Memento'). Thus, my comment is pretty much just about the movie rather than how it compares to the original.There's really a lot to like about. This isn't merely a 'catch-the-bad-guy' thriller but a character driven psychological drama. It starts as a who done it, then turns into a how done it to why done it to what are you going to do about it. While it is the complex characters that stand out, the details of the murder case(s) are very well presented and the layered twists add well to the plot. 'Insomnia' is fascinating to look at. The production design is of very high quality and the cinematography is breathtaking. The attention to detail and the emphasis of the visuals that make the viewer experience Dormer's sleep deprived world is stunning. Incidentally, I was watching it very late at night and perhaps that is the best time to watch it.Nolan's style of execution is remarkable. Daylight is used very effectively as a character of its own. In a way, it's the antagonist of the movie that leads to Dormer's mental 'deterioration'. It's a dark movie set in constant daylight. Then there's the clever use of fog and floating logs which in a way act as pathetic fallacies. Blood also plays a symbolic role. The quietness of a cold and gloomy Alaska is both intense and chilling.Al Pacino proves again what an excellent actor he is. It's amazing how he eerily looks the part with bags under his eyes, a clumsy gait, stooped shoulders and a continuous expression of fatigue while he dives into the depth of an extremely complex character. Robin Williams skillfully downplays his part as the latently manipulative Finch as he takes advantage of Dormer's vulnerability. Hillary Swank brings an air of freshness as the rookie detective who also has to make a difficult decision towards the end. Maura Tierney makes very good use of her few scenes.On the flip side, it may seem as though 'Insomnia' loses focus in some scenes as it appears to derail. Of course there are different ways of looking at this. The ending feels rushed and is very predictable. Also Williams's Finch could have been more developed considering the important role he has. Nonetheless, it's a well-made film. I intend to watch the Norwegian version to see how it compares but on its own, Nolan's 'Insomnia' is a fascinating experience and the cast and crew deserve all the praise for finally putting it all together.

A veteran detective with skeletons in his closet, whisked away to a foreign land (for whatever reason) - it's been done many times. Most of the time, the "is he dirty or isn't he?" routine is frustrating ("Black Rain", "Boom Town", "Rising Sun", etc.). BUt it's different with "Insomnia"; you pretty much know the main character is a dirty cop, so it's really about the walls closing in, which is actually refreshing. And it adds levels.Other than that, it's the talent of the main cast that makes this fresh. Pacino, Swank and Williams are all terrific (although Williams is perfectly at home with quietly deranged; it's beyond creepy). And Pacino is well-suited for a guy who can't get any sleep. He makes run-down look easy.7/10

Al Pacino's character looked tired when he arrived in the Alaskan town. As he attempts to reconcile a serious mistake, he grows wearier and wearier. Enter Robin Williams, a sociopath who plays a cat and mouse game with Pacino. Balance that against the perceptive and admiring Hillary Swank and a lot of baggage from Pacino, and you have the ingredients for a terrific thrill a minute film. I found myself rooting for the Pacino character even though there is a level of dishonesty that will be hard to reconcile. He must cover some huge tracks. There are some issues with Williams' ability to know things that are a little far fetched. Many villains fall into that gap, but that's OK. We take him for what he is. It's an engaging movie.

There is a scene in the original Insomnia where the protagonist (there played by Stellan Skarsgard, in this remake by Al Pacino), desperate to obtain a damaged bullet to tamper with the evidence of an ongoing investigation, approaches a dog in a dark alley and kills it. The remake mimics the scene, except the dog shot by Pacino is dead already. In a nutshell, this shows the difference between the two movies.Before this sounds like some kind of anti-remake crusade, I'll say Nolan's movie surpasses the Norwegian original from many points of view.Performances are stronger, led by a nicely low-key turn by Pacino, who reminds us what a great thespian he can be when he isn't hamming it up. The character of the killer is more developed, here aptly played by Robin Williams in one of those creepy clear-eyed, smug-faced turns of his. Dialogues are crisp without getting too cozy, cinematography makes an interesting use of colors and light.So, where does this thriller - focused on two veteran Homicide detectives searching for a killer in Alaska - goes wrong? It erases most of the moral ambiguity of the original. Skarsgard's dark protagonist was genuinely unsettling - a lost man who quickly sinks to ignominious lows to cover up his own mistakes. Here, Pacino is flawed in a much safer and more traditional way. The extent this remake goes to soften his main character into something more palatable to a mass audience is actually rather amusing in a meta kind of way.The greatest betrayal, though, is the ending, with the martyred hero redeemed by his own blood who passes the torch to Swank's young idealistic cop with a smile and a moral lesson. From the director of the dangerous and abrasive Memento, it's a real shame.7,5/10

I was really looking forward to this film, and I'm glad to say that I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  First of all, I was glad to see Al Pacino on screen again.  It seems like it's been a while since I've seen him on screen.  I think the last film he was in was "Any Given Sunday."  Pacino yet again delivers a brilliant performance, strapping the audience in for a wild ride through the emotionally scarred mind of Detective Will Dormer.  It seemed like I could feel his every emotion throughout the course of the movie.  Because this is a character-driven story that revolves around Dormer, his pain, anguish and guilt on account of accidentally taking his partner's life, constant insomnia and subsequent threats by his nemesis, played by Robin Williams as a writer of trashy detective novels who's fascinated by Dormer and blackmails him by threatening to spill out the secret of Dormer shooting his partner.  As for Robin Williams, he is fully convincing as the reclusive novelist/murderer of a 17-year-old girl.  I suspected, from the trailers, that he'd play a serial killer.  I wouldn't exactly classify his character as a serial killer, but he is the antagonist and a murderer and Williams plays the role perfectly, never underplaying it and never overplaying it.  He could've went over-the-top, playing a totally ruthless killer who cackles at the thought of murdering someone in cold blood.  Though he's not our sympathetic character, you do feel sympathy for him at times.  And I like how the story creates this little cat-and-mouse game between the two characters, each one plagued by skeletons in the closet.  Oscar-winner Hilary Swank delivers another fine performance, and I was stunned to see how amazingly attractive she looks, after having seen her gender-bending role as Brandon Teena in "Boys Don't Cry."
Christopher Nolan is the acclaimed director of "Memento" and he scores yet again, with this beautifully constructed thriller.  I was intrigued from start to finish.  Nolan's use of lighting is dark and murky, wonderfully setting the noirish tone.  Nolan shows great promise as an up-and-coming director, and with a good outlet he can possibly become the next Kubrick. I greatly look forward to seeing his next project, whenever that may be.I recommend "Insomnia" to anyone who loved Nolan's previous "Memento" or anyone who simply enjoys a great, multi-faceted mystery/thriller that will keep you guessing at every turn.  I think it's too early to vote this movie as one of the best films of 2002, but it's a possible candidate.  We don't see too many "great" films anymore, and whenever they're out there it's good to take advantage.My score:  9 (out of 10)

Who doesn't love Al Pacino? Anyone.....Come on..... there at least should be one hater! Guess there is not. Al Pacino is loved by everyone who has seen him as "Michael Vito Corleone" in The Godfather Trilogy or the ruthless "Tony Montana" in Scarface. These films were the highlights of his career and even though he isn't as memorable as Will Dormer in Insomnia, it is hard not to give him an honorable mention. Insomnia is referred to as a "Cat and Mouse" thriller and it proved that it is one because of the whole chase thing between Will Dormer, a cop, and a local writer who goes by the name of Walter Finch, a man who is under the suspicion of killing a teen. This is proved even more when there is an actual ground chase between them two on the logs in the flowing river. That scene was full of heart pounding action and added a bit of intrigue that made you appreciate the film a little bit more. The film would have been unknown to me if there weren't the three Oscar winners, Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank that made this thriller for what it is, also if Christopher Nolan hadn't directed it. He is truly a great director. Steven Spielberg has to watch out for the might of Nolan. Al Pacino was absolute and admirable in Insomnia therefore making him the best actor in the whole film. His role as a tough cop was fascinating and hypnotizing. Robin Williams, who portrays Walter Finch, was not as great as Al's however he still doesn't disappoint. This is not Robin Williams best role but it MIGHT be his most evilest role in his "Evil Trilogy". Hilary Swank's character Ellie Burr made you think that she was unnecessary but as the film reaches its climax you realize that she plays an important part. Swank's performance could not rival against her other roles in "Million Dollar Baby" or "Boy's don't Cry" however she is agreeable but not fun to watch. The films chilly, or spooky, atmosphere is the best in any movie, I have ever seen so far. It just makes the films setting really home-sweet-home. The scenery at the beginning was beautiful as the plane flew over the ice and glaciers of Alaska.In Nightmute, Alaska, seventeen year old resident Kay Connell is found murdered. As a favor to the local Nightmute police chief, two Los Angeles Robbery Homicide police detectives, Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart, are called in to assist in the investigation. Although renowned in the police world, both Dormer and Eckhart are facing some professional issues back in Los Angeles. In Nightmute, Dormer has a major case of insomnia due to a combination of the incessant midnight sun and from a secret he is carrying. This insomnia is causing him to be delusional. Something he is not dreaming about is that the murderer has contacted him, informing him all about the murder and the fact that he knows everything that is going on with Dormer. They begin a symbiotic relationship in keeping secrets for each individual's benefit. But ambitious young local detective, Ellie Burr, might piece the story together on her own.

Christopher Nolan follows the flawless MEMENTO with this, another one-word title film and another inventive, superb effort. Based on a Norwegian movie (which I haven't, as yet, seen), this tells the oft-told tale of a world-weary cop vs. a nasty and particularly slimy killer. What makes it special is the script – very believable and down-to-earth – and the characters, who are so realistically drawn that you can easily believe they are living, breathing people. The setting of the icy, desolate Alaskan town is very good indeed, combined with excellent cinematography which brings out every characteristic of the location and makes it feel really unique. Nolan shoots his film expertly, mixing in some fine chase and action sequences (the log run is brilliantly conceived) with the heavier, more dramatic moments.Al Pacino is fine in the role of the ageing, flawed cop. Sure it's a performance we've all seen before but he makes it extra special with his singular powers of method acting and realism. You feel tired just looking at his weary, end-of-the-road cop. The supporting cast are all fine but it's Robin Williams who really steals the show as the killer, Finch. Williams is nasty, slimy, villainous, creepy, and totally scary, a mundane and quiet little man who's prone to bursts of a violent psychopathic nature. The film remains unpredictable throughout, letting the suspense build gradually as the cat-and-mouse storyline increases the tension, before ending in a sudden burst of violence and excitement. Magnificent stuff, sadly all too rare these days in Hollywood but a reminder of what a good director, a good script and a good cast can really do.

As is evident by now, anyone who has enjoyed Christopher Nolan's movies would, most probably, Insomnia at the bottom of their favorite from Nolan. While people who don't enjoy the Nolan brand of cinema will mark Insomnia as their favorite from Nolan. Simply because, this movie is a remake and while has many of Nolan's signature styles, it is not as evident as it is in his other superior works (IMHO).Nolan's movies (from Following to Inception) is built around the concept of duality. Insomnia has a similar theme running through it, that of Al Pacino's character living the life of a honest role-model while still doing things reprehensible, thus showing two sides of life. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are in supreme form and the cinematography by Wally Pfister is gorgeous. But the 'quickness' that is associated with other Nolan movies (even BB) is visibly absent in this one. It is by no means a bad movie, but the slow burn of the thriller does dampen the effect. Not a must watch, but an intriguing thriller that well matches its Swedish inspiration.

Al Pacino's acting once again is a highlight of a film he's in. He has the capacity to dominate a film with his presence. In this re-make of the Norwegian film, Pacino is excellent as a good-yet-tainted policeman who starts to unravel after not sleeping for four or five days. The Alaskan summer, with light 24 hours of day, can do that to visitorsRobin Williams, meanwhile, plays a killer. It's funny how comedians can do so well playing dramatic roles and Williams is a prime example. He's especially good at creepy nut-cases (See "One Hour Photo") Williams doesn't enter the movie until about halfway through and he's fascinating in a low-key role (until the end).For a modern-day crime film, this doesn't have a lot of action but that's fine if the acting is this good and the story involving. Here, the acting is better than the story. Kudos to Hillary Swank, too, for her performance as the cop.The Alaskan scenery ain't bad, either.

"Insomnia" is a thriller that has some big names attached to it: Al Pacino, Robin Williams & Hilary Swank; all designated as 'Academy Award Winner' on the movie poster. Director Christopher Nolan is also well-known, though his only Oscar nomination is for a co-screen writing credit.The story concerns a veteran cop (Al Pacino) sent to Alaska along with his partner in order to aid in a murder investigation. Through a series of events cop & killer (Robin Williams) eventually come face to face, though under circumstances that pit them against each other in a battle of wits.The cast, as previously noted, is stocked with Oscar-caliber talent. However, it seems to me that those casting the film went for big name actors over others who may have been better suited to the parts. I have no complaints about Al Pacino as he's played this sort of character enough times to be able to do it in his sleep. On the other hand, Robin Williams just didn't convince me as a murderer in the usual Hollywood 'criminal mastermind' mold. Hilary Swank was decent enough but her role demanded none of the skill that won her two well-deserved Oscars. The movie makers should have skipped Swank's price tag and spent the money on better support because most of it is merely television-caliber.The script is a pretty good one if you like thrillers of this sort, although it's been done to death by now. Nolan's direction throws in some admittedly breathtaking outdoor scenery while the more intimate scenes are no better than average. The score by David Julyan is decent enough but I can't really recall anything particularly interesting or memorable about it.On the whole, the film is a perfectly acceptable thriller though it falls into the trap of placing more emphasis on stars than story. However, I expect that fans of the genre will not find it difficult to overlook the supposed faults that I've outlined.

Insomnia is almost a collage of several other mystery films (namely Se7en) tied into one, but not distinctively. Although it wasn't completely repetitive, it was as cliché as detective work goes, and the movie didn't stand out one way or another. Whether it's the elusive murderer on the loose or the mentally plagued cop who's trying his best, this movie is predictable and lacks ingenuity. Accompanying the lack of creativity, the prime actors and actresses had average performances and the emotional conviction in the roles was often lacking. A straight plot followed by routine dialogue made Insomnia rather mundane and an effort to watch. Although there were particular exciting scenes, they were rather short and sparse. The resources were there, but execution was a miss.Whether it's L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects, Se7en or any other great mystery movie, these all had a strong emotional attachment that hook viewers into truly empathizing with the protagonists and mystery at hand. Unfortunately in Insomnia, it's almost like you already know the fate of the characters, and still don't care.

Like the 1997 Norwegian film on which it is based, 'Insomnia' is a superbly crafted crime thriller, one that is more concerned with the psychological complexities of its main character than with the minutiae of the criminal investigation itself - though the details of the case are fascinating in their own right as well.Al Pacino delivers his finest performance in years in the role of Detective Will Dormer, a seasoned homicide investigator brought in from Los Angeles to help solve the murder of a seventeen-year-old high school student in rural Alaska. The problem is that, back in L.A., Dormer is facing some heat of his own from LAPD's Internal Affairs Division, which is beginning a probe into the propriety of some of the veteran's actions on the job. Back in Alaska, while on a stakeout to nab the possible killer, Dormer becomes disoriented in the fog and ends up accidentally shooting and killing his longtime partner, a colleague who, Dormer had just learned, was planning to cooperate with the IA investigation back home, thereby bringing about the possible ruination of Dormer's career and reputation. Caught off guard by this sudden turn of events, Dormer suddenly finds himself in the unfamiliar role of perpetrator, looking for ways to cover up a 'crime' rather than unravel it. One of the compelling themes of the film is its insistence that only a very thin line separates those who commit crimes from those whose job it is to uncover and prosecute the wrongdoers.Dormer is stunned to find how quickly and easily he can cross over that line. The outstanding screenplay by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaerg really knows how to get into the minds and emotions of its characters, particularly in the case of Dormer, who turns out to be one of the most psychologically complex and fascinating figures we have encountered in the movies in a long, long time. Here is a man who has built his name and career on knowing how to unravel complex crimes, always priding himself on being one step ahead of the criminals who are so convinced they have left no traces behind which could point to their guilt. Yet, now Dormer finds himself in the same boat, as he anxiously looks for ways to hide the fact that he shot - even accidentally - a man who had the power to bring him down. As the story develops, Dormer, whom we assume at the start is innocent of the charges for which he is being investigated by Internal Affairs, begins to seem less and less innocent and more and more capable of doing just exactly what it is he is being accused of. Yet, the triumph of the film is that Pacino and the screenwriters never let us feel we know all there is to know about Dormer. He is truly a man of mystery, so tightly coiled that even he doesn't know or understand all that is going on in the deepest, darkest recesses of his psyche. By setting the film in the summer near the Arctic Circle, the filmmakers are able to provide a natural phenomenon to help aggravate Dormer's potentially psychotic condition. Like Mersault in Camus' 'The Stranger,' Dormer becomes strangely disoriented by the oppressive effect of the sun, though, in this case, it is the lack of a night that drives Dormer crazy through insomnia. As the virtually indistinguishable days and nights pass without sleep, Dormer begins to suffer from delirium and hallucinations, making it all the harder for him to separate truth from fiction, fantasy from reality and - most importantly - right from wrong and morality from immortality. When the killer reveals to Dormer that he saw him shoot his partner, Dormer finds himself faced with the ethical crisis of turning the culprit in or of bonding with him as 'partners' in mutual criminality and guilt. Here again the once-clear and distinct line between investigator and criminal suddenly ceases to exist.Pacino, stoop-shouldered and craggy-faced - the prominent bags under his eyes a physical testimony to his weariness and sleeplessness - plumbs the very depths of this infinitely rich and complex character. In fact, there is nothing less than an outstanding performance in the entire film. Robin Williams brings an air of restraint and understatement to the part of Walter Finch, the killer who plays a cat-and-mouse mind game with the sleepless, intellectually vulnerable Dormer, exploiting Dormer's weakened state to his own advantage. Hilary Swank brings a warmth and compassion to her role as Ellie Burr, an eager-to-please detective who has long idolized Dormer and his work, who also has to make an emotionally wrenching choice near the end of the film. Finally, Maura Tierney makes her few scenes count as a sympathetic innkeeper whom Dormer turns to as the person who happens to be handy at the moment when the need to unburden his soul spontaneously arises within him.As the film's director, Christopher Nolan establishes and maintains a mood of quiet intensity throughout the course of the film. Helped by the stark, but somewhat oppressively gloomy beauty of the Alaskan outpost setting, Nolan makes us experience the same sense of unease and disorientation Dormer himself feels. Nolan has chosen to punctuate his film with a series of highly charged, intensely dramatic confrontation scenes between Dorman and any number of the other characters in the film. The film never wanes in interest for even a moment of its running time.It is an enormous pleasure to see a film as intelligently conceived and executed as 'Insomnia.' Kudos to everyone involved with making this such a rare and fascinating movie going experience. But the greatest thanks goes to Al Pacino himself. He has never been so good.

Will Dormer is a veteran LA detective, recognized for his investigative skills, noted by his peers as a good cop.I was expecting a typical detective story with lots of puzzles and thrilling mysteries, hoping to see why Will Dormer is acclaimed for his job. But this is not really the focal point of the story. Just around 25 minutes in the movie, you'll already see a major lead about the suspect.While I understand that the story begins after the foggy beach chase, I was left wanting for more build up and mystery in the investigation. It really felt rushed.The first encounter with Walter Finch at the rocky beach put me in the edge of my seat. It's a pretty good cat and mouse chase but the real surprise is the accidental shooting of Hap that really sent me in shock.I'm not really a fan of the ending. I think it's predictable and too safe for an interesting lead character. And Ellie Burr, towards the end of the film, suddenly became too soft for Will that she tried to cover up the truth for him.Insomnia is a character-driven, psychological thriller. It explores the character's moral judgement on how they will navigate their way through difficult choices where their principles are at stake.Robin Williams as Walter Finch doesn't appeal to me that much but I love every bit of Al Pacino's acting as Will Dormer. Those sleep-deprived eyes, hunchback posture, and piercing stares look so authentic you can feel his weariness. Overall, it's a decent film but I'm not obsessed with it.

I used to think that nobody could come close to Robert De Niro when it comes to who was the best actor in Hollywood but as the years went by he started to pick some real Turkeys and a in the mean while an old hand was gradually taking the crown from De Niro and that is Al Pacino. In Insomnia he has picked another cracker of a film that although not fast paced is brilliantly acted and is very watchable. Hilary Swank is superb as is Robin Williams and its refreshing to see him taking a serious role instead of sentimental trash like Patch Adams but as per usual it is Al Pacino who steals the show. He plays an insomniac Cop who gets intangled in a murder case and gets into trouble after accidently killing his partner . I cant think of an actor who looks more tired than Pacino anyway so he was perfect for the role. The story is OK but to be honest the film is more about the performances than the plot. 8 out of 10

Riveting and interesting thriller with brilliant performances. Two Los Angeles homicide detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are dispatched to a northern town where the sun doesn't set to investigate the methodical murder of a local teen. To Ellie (Hilary Swank) the rookie assigned to assist the detective Dormer's a hero. But she doesn't knows Dorner is investigated by Internal Affairs. Poor Dormer,however, he's really disoriented in every scene, no longer distinguishes so clearly between means and motive, cause and effect. He who sins, does not sleep ! .Days never end. Nightmares are real. No one is innocent. Don't close your eyes. A tough cop. A brilliant killer. An unspeakable crime. A murder investigator has been brought in on a special case, sleep deprived, he makes a horrible mistake which is discovered by the killer he has been hunting !.This taut psychological thriller contains intrigue, action, shootouts , suspense, twists and turns. If all this may sound familiar, it's because Hillary Seitz's subtle script improves on the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name: Insomnia by Erik Skjoldbjærg with Stellan Skarsgård, Sverre Anker Ousdal, Gisken Armand. Concerning a twisted premise: when a killing takes place and covers it up, a double sided game of cat-and-mouse ensues. Despite its linear script, the movie is very recognisable the work of the sharp, probing intelligence that gave ¨Following¨ and ¨Memento¨. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the unconventional progression of the storyline and the various twists within the script. While it succeeds as an extremely stylish, gripping thriller, it's also another of the director's takes on life as narrative. Uniformly excellent performance especially from Al Pacino and Robin Williams , lends welcome nuance and depth to the ethical investigation while furnishing the drama with dark, telling ironies and intriguing ambiguity. There are few actors as Pacino who can keep a straight face, yet still manage to convey complex emotion, and he is one of them. He walked through his scenes with somberness and really powerful, yet weary. Pacino and Williams are well accompanied by a magnificent support cast, such as: Hilary Swank, Paul Dooley, Nicky Katt, Maura Tierney, Jonathan Jackson, Katharine Isabelle Larry Holden, Jay Brazeau, Lorne Cardinal, Ian Tracey, among others.It displays thrilling and suspenseful musical score by David Julyan . As well as cloudy and evocative cinematography by Wally Pfister , Nolan's regular, shot on several locations in Britannia Beach, Columbia Británica, Canadá, Port Alberni, Columbia Británica, Canadá, Hyder, Valdez, Alaska . The motion picture was perfectly written and directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia¨, ¨Memento¨ , ¨The Prestige¨ , ¨Batman begins¨, ¨The Dark Knight¨ , ¨The Dark Knight Rises¨, ¨Dunkirk¨, among others . Rating : Above average 7.5/10 , it was throughly entertaining and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think . The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work , it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final.

First off, Christopher Nolan is one of my biggest influences when it comes to film and screen writing. With films such as Following and Memento, both of which reached cult following levels, he is well on his way to a successful Hollywood career. Then, today came, his 3rd film was released, Insomnia. Based on a 1997 Norwegian film written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg, Insomnia is a true work of art in the world of film.Christopher Nolan takes all that was the 1997 film, and brings it to the next level, using his own style of directing, a musical score with shades of Memento, and an all star cast. Al Pacino and Robin Williams pulls out the greatest performances of their careers in the past decade, if not in their ENTIRE careers in my eyes. Pacino once again excels in the role of master dective, while Williams takes this chance to show his "dark side", and he does it so well. I can only hope that this is a rebirth of Robin Williams, and as it stands with his upcoming film One Hour Photo (which he once again plays a dark, psychotic role), it seems to be just that! Hilary Swank also pulls out what is the greatest role of her career.Insomnia brings you in as an audience, with it's perfectly woven plot, with a film noir feel to it, just as Nolan's first two films. It is a rollercoster ride of drama and suspense as you watch Al Pacino from the very beginning unravel, and the rest of the story and his past catches up with him. I can not say much more about it, as I do not wish to spoil anything about if for you, but I do want to say this... ...go see it, right now, and enjoy. If you love crime/mystery/drama films with that wonderful Film Noir feel to it, you will love this film. If that isn't your thing, then the performances of the three main actors are worth the price of a ticket in itself. Finally I just want to say, that Insomnia proves once and for all that Christopher Nolan will indeed be a force to reckoned with in Hollywood. I've said it before, and I'll say it again... ...Christopher Nolan is well on his way to becoming the Hollywood legend which he proves he is capable of becoming.

The film Insomnia, based on an earlier Norwegian film, is an almost winner.By acclaimed directed Christopher Nolan, (Memento,) this is a bet that almost, but not quite, pays off, in the sense of waiting for the "other shoe to drop." It is not so much a murder mystery as it is a character study, but, as with the rest of the film, it's almost but not quite that, also.Al Pacino is Detective Will Dormer, who has been summoned to Nightmute, Alaska by an old friend to help solve the murder of a 17-year-old girl. Pacino is a man on the verge of many things: retirement, age, and moral collapse, as we learn early on. He and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are being investigated by Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles. On the way to Alaska, Hap informs Dormer that he intends to "cut a deal" and take whatever comes of it. This doesn't please Dormer in the slightest, and he gives the impression he'll fight the investigation, and his partner's selling-out, but fate has a different idea. Early in the investigation, Dormer accidentally shoots Hap. With his partner now dead, Dormer has nothing more to fear from IA. Or so he imagines.Enter Walter Finch, played by Robin Williams; he is the main suspect in the murder, and has also seen the shooting of Hap, or so he informs Dormer. Now the plot will weave around these two, almost exclusively, as they play their game of manipulation and one-upmanship. And here's where the film begins to lose its own compass.First, I had a bit of a problem with the fact that the two detectives from L.A. were in Alaska to begin with. Supposedly, this is an official trip, but I have trouble believing that the Los Angeles Police Dept would send two of its people to Alaska for such a mundane reason. Yes, it's murder, but the ease with which these two solve the case and pinpoint the murderer is just so fast that it's hard to believe the Alaskans couldn't have done the same, and done it sooner. Second, the character of Ellie Burr, (Hilary Swank) who has made a study of Detective Dormer's work for her academy thesis, is just a little too worshipful. And what a coincidence that she should be there in Nightmute, involved in this case. It's a little too contrived, in my opinion. Hilary Swank, a wonderful actress, is overqualified for the wide-eyed wonderment she portrays here. There's not enough depth in her character to hold your interest.Third, we never really get a chance to pick apart Finch, Robin Williams' character. We only know a little about him, but nothing essential, and nothing that adds to our understanding of why he committed this foul deed in the first place, or what is driving him to do what he does. We come into this situation, "in the middle" and leave it pretty much the same way when the movie ends. There's a solution, but no enlightenment.
There are two other interesting characters that also tease us into wanting to know more, but never give up any information beyond that: the hotel desk clerk, played by Maura Tierney, and Police Chief Nyback, played by Paul Dooley, are both characters I would have liked to see developed into "whole" people. Especially Tierney's character, who says one of the most fascinating lines in the film, something about how people in Alaska are either born there or are there because they've escaped something a lot worse. With a lead-in like that, it was a shame not to follow up on it.Mostly, we are treated (?) to extreme closeups of Pacino as he spirals down into his insomniac, ethical black-hole, and teasers of the menace Robin Williams might actually be hiding underneath that parka. In neither case is it enough, or satisfying, and as the film winds down into its inevitable conclusion, we are left with a hollow feeling that we just didn't get enough. We can draw conclusions, but they are not the point; the point is what makes these things happen in the first place, and that's a question that goes unanswered. Additionally, there are some recurring cut-scenes of the murder itself, which are never explained or illuminated. They appear as memory flashes, but we never see them in their entirety, which is extremely annoying. Overall, the film looked as if it were originally a lot longer, and was edited down to fit its current time. If that's not the case, then it's just too minimalist to make a satisfying story. The plot is, or could be, a very good one, with a bit more explanation. There is a lot of atmospheric buildup, but in the end, not much suspense or tension for the viewer. The characters tease us with development, never quite making us understand them, or their motives; they feel thinly painted, and shadowy. Not a tour-de-force for director Nolan, though Pacino and Williams give their parts all the nuances they can.I left wanting more.

I erred in giving into temptation to watch the original Norwegian "Insomnia" on IFC just a couple of weeks before seeing this Hollywood re-make directed by indie-credible "Memento" Christopher Nolan with a very effective Academy Award-winning cast.The original movie had a tiny budget and also an excellent cast, led by the terrific Swede Stellan Skarsgård, growing as pale as that relentless sunshine during the course of the film; the usually haggard-looking Al Pacino interprets his insomnia visually through an ever more haggard face.Though the original film isn't given as the source material until well into the closing credits, this follows the main thrust of the story closely. The changes, though, are both subtle and significant and intriguingly as American as Sam Spade when the mise en scene gets moved to Alaska (actually shot in Vancouver). Significantly, there is less sex and more morality.Hilary Swank's character is more naive than her counterpart; Martin Donovan's character's role is more central to the story and, of course, Robin Williams gets more screen time than his original counterpart, as the conflict is less in the lead's mind and more on the screen as a duel. The plot twists are done differently so I shamefully got confused between the two movies.While not as overwhelming as the original, I do think this version should rank right up with the great detective/cop-does-the-right-thing movies, and the plot makes more sense than "The Big Sleep."(originally written 6/16/2002)

The movie is a decent crime drama thriller which tries to show many things but fails at many places.The story was simple and easily predictable, the screenplay was uneven, the direction was good and the performances were average. The writing of villian's character and his motive was weak. The main character was also not that well written. The suspense of the story was easily predictable and thrill part felt flat. But one thing, even after all this flaws or weaknesses, the overall movie was engaging.Overall, it was a decent crime drama thriller which could have been more tight and more in-depth.

I loved the cop working with the killer. He's playing both side trying to save himself and stop the killer. And the added element of the endless day light was another great ingredient.Pacino as usual gives an outstanding performance. He made me tired just watching him. He did great at his progression of looking more and more tired. And he does these little things you don't normally see actors do. I don't know if I can explain it. But he seems comfortable to the point that he's outside the box and it adds reality.Hilary Swank was great as the young doe eyed cop. She had that look of enthusiasm and optimism in her eyes. And the way that she always looked at Pacino. She was starting out and he was ending. You can see it in both of their faces.Robin Williams was a different but great choice. He's obviously a good actor, we've known that. But we've never seen him like this before. He has some kind of sadness in his face and voice. Something that evokes your sympathy. You didn't want to believe the he was a killer and wanted to believe his story that the murder wasn't his fault. But then his calm passivity becomes creepy and scary. You know what he did the whole time and the fact that he's this calm about it makes him scary.This has two of the best/inventive chases I've ever seen. The foggy beach and the logs in the water. Not only does it utilize the area but it's different. Chasing someone in the fog where you can't see a thing and the killer could be right in front of you is good suspense. And on the beach with big rocks so you have to keep looking where you're going.The logs in the water is everything dangerous: fast, always moving, with the threat of drowning and the ground is unstable. When he falls in the sound was very good at conveying the power of the crashing logs.This was also a good remake. They took the story, made it their own and Americanized it. I hate it when a remake doesn't add anything new. If you're going to make it in a different country, make it in a different country. Don't do what "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" did. The Norwegian one is very good and worth watching.You know you're a good director when this is your least good movie. Of course at the time this was from the guy that did "Memento." We had no idea what the future held for this great director's career. His talent is evident here. Any director could have made this movie but he really added those extra touches to make it stand out

Two detectives travel to canada to help to solve a mysterious crime case (murder of a girl). Will Dormer is characterized es really smart and the best, detective around. Although the local police can't find enough evidence, it takes Will just a view interviews to kind of solve the case. He just "knows" things and people immediately tell him how it really was... They set a trap to find the suspect. Because it is extremely foggy, he shoots his colege in an accident. Then he doesn't say it was an accident, no, he tries to hide the evidence, changes stuff, lies... Which is not so smart and he must know better! Its just luck that he is not caught immediately. Mr Finch, the real murder, hears everything and sees everything except you could probably see 3m that foggy day... He must have stood right next to them... Then he blackmails Will and blames somebody else who gets arrested for the murder of the girl.All that time Will can't sleep because in canada the sun doesn't set. In his room he tries to darken his room by using a kind of transparent tape to block the sun... Why? Why is he no just asking for a really dark room. Or use a kind of blindfold... This irritated me so much. The best detective in the world is not able to darken his room? And why the whole sleepdeprivation motive? In memento it really has a function in the movie. Here, Will is just always tired and the whole movie is called like that. Its just weired. It dorsn't add to the storry. He doesn't sleep for 6 days, right. He doesn't tell anybody... Doesn't use sleep medicarion...
And why did Mr Finch clean the girls body after the murder, without any stress and then levae the backpack with his book inside? He is portraied as the smartesd guy arround, but makes the most stupid mistakes...
The movie is not bad at all but feels a bit dumb and forced at times. The conversations between will and finch are great. The way the story goes is interesting but it's feels too constructed and at times not comprehensible.

You know that feeling a movie gives you at the end?  This one definitely had it.  Not because it was great, but because IT WAS OVER!  Robin Williams and Al Pacino played their roles perfectly, however, the story left me wanting, wondering If and hoping there was some kind of moral.  The final twist I was waiting for never seemed to come, either.  I own Following and Memento (Nolan's other films), but just cannot say I enjoyed this movie.  This film IS the CURE for INSOMNIA.
