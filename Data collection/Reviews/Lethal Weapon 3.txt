I caught this movie on TV a few days ago, so I may as well voice my opinion. I've enjoyed all the "Lethal Weapon" flicks and I hope one day to buy a boxed set of DVDs containing all four in the series.  Don't ask which one I think is best.  They're all lots of fun to watch.  Of course, the original didn't have as much humor as its sequels.  Mel Gibson's character was a downtrodden loner, who was established as a "loose cannon."  But as the series continued, he suddenly turned into Buddy Hackett, cracking jokes left and right.  Needless to say, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make one of the best on-screen duos in the history of film.  Their characters of Riggs and Murtaugh are like polar opposites, but that's the beauty of it.  That's the essence of the buddy cop genre.  The two partners are always at each other's throats, yet they share a great bond and deliver much humor.  Richard Donner is a spectacular action film director, and there are some breathtaking stunts.  The opening truck chase is extremely memorable. 
And each and every scene is buoyed by great comic relief.  Gibson says a great line when he arrests the fraudulent truck driver:  "You have the right to remain unconscious.  Whatever you say...ain't gonna be much."  That's a priceless line!  OK, so the plot is meandering.  There are scenes that are very entertaining, yet don't really move the story along.  But the whole movie is so funny and exciting that I just think...who gives a damn?  I'm having too much fun! 
Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz, adds additional comic relief.  His bleached blond do is hilarious enough, and his nebbish schtick makes it all the more humorous.  Rene Russo is also added to the cast, to provide some good eye candy.  Just like the Bond girls, there's always a sexy love interest in the "Lethal Weapon" movies.  In the second movie, there was Patsy Kensit. 
And there are some human elements to the story.  Danny Glover's Murtaugh still thinks "he's getting too old for this s**t" and is about to retire. He's suffering a severe middle-age crisis and to add to his problems, he ends up killing one of his son's friends--which he did out of self-defense. Sometimes I think Glover's acting talent is underrated.  And though this is a fluffy action/comedy, he delivers the kind of powerful performance he would in any Oscar-winning masterpiece.  "Lethal Weapon 3" again showcases the immense talent of its two irreplacable leads.  This sequel packs a lethal punch and delivers first-class entertainment from start to finish.  And I love that Eric Clapton/Sting song "It's Gonna Be Me."  My score:  8 (out of 10)

So this is the one where it all seems to get to be a lil much. Like wherever Murtagh and Riggs go there is trouble. It's still effective but a bit silly. This time around the baddie is quite generic, an ex cop selling confiscated weapons and police killing ammunition. Sure the guys are great but the real joy here is Renee Russo as Riggs new love interest. She's an IA officer whose bad ass and can hold her own. The interplay and chemistry between her and Riggs is great. But all the other stuff feels a lil silly at times. That being said it's still really fun and the last action setpiece in the housing development is quite fun and suspenseful. But the formula starts to feel a bit old. It's a low point for the franchise but it's still pretty damn good and that's all due to the charismatic cast.

Our friends Los Angeles policemen Martin Riggs(Mel Gibson) and and his methodical pal Roger Murtaugh(Danny Glover now are patrolling through the streets after a botcher explosion caused into a building. Roger is about to retire when they encounter themselves into a dangerous case. A previous police named Leo(Stuart Wilson) turned into criminal kingpin and heinous weapons smuggling. Meanwhile Martin falls in love with a tough police(Rene Russo) from Internal Affairs.This fast paced picture packs noisy supercharged action scenes ,thrills, loud pursuits, lot of violence and murders.The wacky police Gibson, always on the edge, and his partner the gentle and good father Glover again give nice performances with special chemistry between the two actors. They go after and run afoul a nasty villain well played by Stuart Wilson, including to Joe Pesci as likable swindler. Furthermore appear as secondaries Mark Pellegrino, Nick Chunlund,Alan Scarfe and unbilled , the director's wife and also producer: Lauren Shuler Donner as a nurse and the director Stephen T. Kay as a filmmaker. Colorful cinematography by equally director Jan De Bont and atmospheric musical score by Michael Kamen , accompanied by catching song by Eric Clapton. Richard Donner directs with fair-play and the result is quite entertaining. Acceptable and passable movie for enthusiastic of the series won't be disappointed. It's followed by the last chapter 'Lethal weapon 4' with same players adding to Jet Li and Chris Rock.

Riggs and Murtaugh arrest a man on gun charges just for him to be killed in the interrogation room by ex-cop Jack Travis.  Travis is running illegal guns.  Riggs and Murtaugh team up with IA officer Cole to track down and stop Travis while Murtaugh also faces trouble at home as the illegal guns impact on his family.This third in the series is a lot more polished and refined than the first two - there's a lot of money riding on this now!  The story is quite good but it's not rocket science.  It's really all an excuse to have a series of set pieces - from a building being destroyed to a desert showdown.  The romance between Riggs and Cole take away from Riggs' madman style character and makes the film a lot softer.  It also makes the action scenes a lot less believable as he seems to revert to action hero on cue.  However it does allow some humour.  The involvement of Pesci is funny but at times it's a little stretched.Gibson and Murtaugh are good, mainly because they're just having fun now in well worn characters - like old shoes!  Pesci is not quite as annoying as he was in LW2 but is still a bit of a spare wheel.  Russo is good as the love interest and handles herself well.Overall it's good fun but it lacks the dark, rough tone that made LW such a hit in the first place.

This is a great series! Actually I could stop right here because I have already said what needs to be said but just for people's enjoyment I'll elaborate a little.The acting is, much like in the two previous films, excellent. Somehow Mel Gibson and Danny Glover never seem to get tired of each other and it shows because their playful banter never seems to get tiring to the audience. Mel Gibson is a class actor and this time around he develops the character of Martin Riggs even further than he did in the second film. He is so good at portraying emotions that the audience genuinely feels with him. When he is angry you feel his anger and when he is sad you feel sad, you get the picture. The fact that he is so versatile shows in the contrasts of the character. He is both great in action-sequences and in romantic sequences. As for Danny Glover he also does a great job in bringing his character further and he really does in this installment because you get to see the more negative sides of the character this time around. In the first two films he was the character who didn't evolve much but took pride in it. This time, because retirement is rearing its ugly head, we get to see, what I must suppose was, the facade stripped away and see Murtaugh in his raw, pure form. Joe Pesci also returns this time for the comic relief and he is still funny. There is just something about the character of Leo Getz that is incredibly entertaining. However, the best performance is perhaps done by Stuart Wilson, an incredibly underrated actor who has sadly never really achieved a commercial breakthrough. He is the villain of this film and is perhaps the best villain of the series simply because he has more depth than any other villain in the series. He is also given considerably more screen time than many of the other villains so he really has a chance to shine. Rene Russo appears in this film as Riggs new romantic interest and she may not be the most gifted actress ever to be on film but her chemistry with Mel Gibson is undeniable and her on-screen presence is pretty amazing considering that she is a new entry to the character gallery.The story of the film is the weakest out of all the series (yes even the fourth one) and sometimes it kinda drags. Mainly, however, the story is still highly entertaining and funny. The best element of the script is the fact that villain is an ex-cop this time around and that does that the heroes can hate the villain even more because he is, aside from being a mean bastard, a traitor, almost a symbol of the back-side of the medallion.The action of the film is just like in the two previous movies absolutely brilliant. The action is highly entertaining and well made and Mel Gibson is excellent as an action star as well as many other things.All in all a great entry to a great series. 7/10

'Lethal Weapon 3' has the best opening sequence of all 'Lethal Weapon'-movies, although the opening of the fourth installment comes close. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) try to disable a bomb and what happens in the end can probably only happen in a movie like this. It is hilarious and spectacular anyway.The movie starts eight days before Murtaugh's retirement. He and Riggs must find an ex-cop named Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson). He steals weapons and ammunition from the police. At first they thought it was an inside job so Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) from Internal Affairs is put on the case. She is the perfect match for Riggs, beautiful but tough. We also meet Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) again. He kind of helps them with this case and again he is very good for the comedy.This is a fine installment although things get more and more familiar. Still, as long as it is spectacular and funny that doesn't really matter. The fun Gibson, Glover and director Richard Donner must have making this movie is clearly visible on the screen.

Even though this is in my opinion the weakest out of the Lethal Weapon series, that of course doesn't mean that this movie isn't fun and entertaining to watch.It suffers from the same minor flaws as the previous 2 Lethal Weapon movies. The story is incredibly simple, standard action material. It's totally uninteresting and also told in a totally uninteresting way. Also the villain is yet again heavily underused. But it's true that none of the Lethal Weapon movies have ever relied on its story. Instead the movie heavily relies on its two main character; Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. And when you have two such characters like Riggs and Murtaugh, who have such an amazing chemistry together, you just don't need much else to make a good and entertaining movie.Unfortunately the movie does nowhere live up to its fantastic and memorable beginning. Everything that happens after the opening sequence isn't really that interesting or memorable. The movie doesn't always have the right pace and the way the story is presented make it seem even less interesting than it is on paper.The movie is filled with some great characters next besides to the two main leads. Joe Pesci returns as Leo Getz and Rene Russo joins the team as a woman who knows how to take care of herself. The villain is this time played by the always great Stuart Wilson. It however is unfortunate that all of these characters are given too little screen time, especially Joe Pesci and Stuart Wilson. All of the Lethal Weapon movies always had great villains, that were also at the same time always heavily underused. Same goes for Wilson in this particular case, who's talent is practically wasted.But luckily the movie is still of course a perfectly entertaining one. This is absolutely thanks to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who still have the magic chemistry together, after already 2 Lethal Weapon movies. The two of them provide some great and hilarious moments together, that alone is reason enough why this movie is a good and enjoyable one to watch.Maybe not as good- but certainly just as entertaining as all of the other Lethal Weapon movies.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a buddy cop action movie the third sequel in the "Lethal Weapon" series, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon 3 (1992) is for my opinion the second best in the series! I love this flick, I always have enjoyed much more than I did Lethal Weapon 2. I love this sequel, I think is so much better than Lethal Weapon 2! Because the second installment in the series was way too violent movie from the first one, this one was just fun action sequel to the first one and I love it so much! I thought Donner kept the level going for the most part throughout the films!!! Why don't people like the last two movies!! I pretty stayed up half the night for two nights in a row because I got so hooked with these movies!. I especially love Rene Russo she's so sexy, sassy, and kicks a lot of ass in it. A nice addition to the team. Rene Russo in this movie she was the second crush I had on her. She was the most beautiful girl playing a tough cop ever. I was happy her character was not killed off, by the end of the movie. When the film ended I was really sad because I didn't know what happened too Martin Riggs and Lorna Cole, did their romance lasted forever. I was always hooked up and when I hared they are making Lethal Weapon 4 in 1998, I couldn't wait for the fourth installment! I grew up with this movie and it is my childhood movie of all time I love it to death!!!Rock on Riggs and Murtaugh! Perhaps as a reflection of that, "Weapon 3" depends more on chases, explosions and set pieces than it does on character development. The story again involves the partnership of Riggs and Murtaugh (Gibson and Glover), buddies in the long tradition of movie cop partners. This time Murtaugh is only eight days from retirement, a sure sign in any cop movie that his life will be repeatedly in danger. I remember Lethal Weapon 3 was a lot of fun and I would say it's my 2nd favorite of the series. Stuart Wilson was a good bad guy, humor was great including the banter. It's an entertaining sequel. I know a lot of people don't like this movie like I do a lot of fans prefer Lethal Weapon 2 over this flick, I don't! I think 1 and 3 are great flicks, 2 is my third favorite film in the franchise!!! Part 1 and 3 of Lethal Weapon I absolutely love! I enjoyed Lethal Weapon 2, I like Lethal Weapon 4. I really love Lethal Weapon 3, I always had fun with it. I highly enjoy it. I don't mind the story, a lot of people complain about the story. I think that story is very interesting. I think Joe Pesci has more screen time in this movie than in part 2. I love when Riggs cut the wrong wire in the opening scene and the whole Building Explodes. They both grabbed the cat and they save the cat ha ha. Than they went on patrol officer now, not anymore detectives. This movie is fun back and forth. The armored car is driven by this crooks and Riggs is chasing it. Riggs eventually has to brake the vehicle hard, causing the armored car to come to a sudden stop, resulting in the bad guy flying through the windshield and coming to rest on the hood and say my favorite line. "You have the right to remain unconscious. Anything you say ain't gonna be much." And Riggs punches the guy in the windshield and says "Back to bed. Back to bed." The car chase scene Riggs jumps off the subway and commandeers an LAPD motorcycle, then continues his pursuit of the truck, which has by then left the rails and taken to the streets. Riggs pursues Travis on the wrong side of a freeway, then into a section that was under construction. Travis manages to get stopped, but Riggs flies off an unfinished ramp, getting hung up by some cables. The cables give way, and he falls through several platforms, to the ground. This scene is Excellent and outstanding stunt, I can always watch that! The scene in the hockey arena is one of my favorite when Leo (Joe Pesci) wrestles with Jack Travis (Staurt Wilson) Their struggle carries them onto the ice and Travis shoots Leo in the arm. Riggs follows Travis out of the arena, but loses him. That scene Riggis running on the ice was fantastic. The end fight scene when Murtaugh takes out Walters, then tosses Darryl's gun to Riggs, loaded with the cop killer bullets. Riggs shoots through the bucket of the front-end loader, killing Travis was awesome! This movie is awesome and it is my favorite film in the "Lethal Weapon" series. It is a 10 for me. Lethal Weapon 3 is the third installment in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. The 1992 action sequel has Detective Sergeants Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) under the eye of an Internal Affairs detective (Rene Russo) during an investigation of a former cop who is dealing in illegal arms and armor-piercing ammunition. The film also stars Joe Pesci and Stuart Wilson. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Warner Bros.

The first 'Lethal Weapon' wasn't perfect, but it is still a very good film and important to the development of the buddy-cop film as well as being one of the best examples. Its first sequel is almost as good, if just missing out on being on the same level or surpassing it.'Lethal Weapon 3' is fun enough, and there is plenty to enjoy, but after the impressive first two films it was somewhat of a let-down. It didn't feel as fresh and had a ran out of ideas feel sometimes. Its weak link is the story, which does have some exciting moments and some good scenes but the first two films were much more focused and tight in plotting, here the story does meander in places and parts drag. Some of the dialogue is a lot of fun, some of it is repetitive and convoluted with a little too much emphasis at times on humour.After being such a delight in the second film, Joe Pesci returns and one was hoping he would be a welcome presence. Sadly count me in as one of the people who found him underused, his character merely being a plot device and Pesci being irritating this time round (the first time ever he's had that effect on me). Was mixed on the villain, Stuart Wilson does enjoy himself immensely and does bring a sinister edge to easily the best acted head villain in comparison to the first two films where the henchmen were more memorable and better played. The character himself was a little sketchy in development however and he could have been used more.However, the way 'Lethal Weapon 3' is shot and designed screams slick and stylish while Richard Donner once again directs with an assured hand. The score is atmospheric and groovy.Parts of the script doe entertain hugely and crackle in wit and tension.Once again, the action is slick and bursts with excitement and tension, with terrific stunts and the sheer scale of them being worthy of huge admiration. It is very easy to see why the chalk and cheese chemistry of the polar opposite characters of Riggs and Murtaugh became so popular, very rarely in a buddy-cop film has this kind of chemistry been so entertaining and perfectly pitched.Mel Gibson continues to excel in a performance as witty and intense has before. Danny Glover gives Murtaugh the right amount of spirit, subtlety and no-nonsense attitude. Rene Russo brings some much needed freshness and gives a strong performance.In summary, fun but the magic is not quite there for me. Not one of the best sequels there is, but hardly a disgrace and nowhere near among the worst. 6/10 Bethany Cox

This is undeniably the funniest of the first three films in the series. (After this one, I had no desire to see the fourth.)  But laughs alone are not enough to carry an action movie.  So let's throw in a lot of cool stunts.  Okay, now we've got enough to entertain viewers for two hours, so why add anything else?  I mean, we don't actually *need* to have a strong villain or emotional depth for the characters do we?   Well, we don't if we're just looking for a couple of hours of escapism. In that role, this movie delivers.  Mel Gibson made me laugh in this movie, despite the utter silliness of the humor.  The stunts kept me on the edge of my seat.  What can I say?  For two hours I had a good time.   But through it all, I still felt empty somehow.  And as I left the theater, I actually looked back and asked myself, "Did I just see a movie?"

This is the third installment of the Lethal Weapon franchise and what usually happens around this point is the creators are just kind of reusing all the ideas just to make money. This one was in that category..It was not all bad it still had all the fun and action of Riggs and Murtaugh teaming up but we have seen it twice before and they just switch the story line slightly.This movie is about Riggs and Murtaugh who try to bust an Ex cop who is now a arms dealer. They go on the case and in the meantime Riggs might have found a love interest.This was a good movie just not as good as the first. Granted if you saw this one second instead of the second one this one would probably be bette its just the same thing as the other two so still good but nothing new here.

Director Richard Donner's "Lethal Weapon 3" qualifies as a sloppily-scripted, slam-bang actioneer with all the subtlety of a brick through a plate glass window. Nevertheless, if you aren't too picky about its problems, "Lethal Weapon 3" can be a lot of fun to watch. Mel Gibson reprises his role as the looney Sgt. Martin Riggs along with Danny Glover as his partner Sgt. Roger Murtaugh. When the movie opens, we learn that Murtaugh has eight days to go before he retires from the LAPD. Staying alive that long around his crazy partner, Sgt. Murtaugh realizes, will take a miracle."Lethal Weapon 3" desperately needs more than a miracle. What is needs is a good plot and a villain you can love to hate. The second sequel in this entertaining police series as not as potent as its predecessors. If anything, "Lethal Weapon 3" is a third less filling. "Lethal Weapon 2" scenarist Jeffrey Boam appears to be running low on fresh ideas. He looks like he borrowed the plot from the 1974 John Sturges' movie "McQ," with John Wayne. This time around the bad guy is a dirty, ex-cop selling contraband machine guns to black street gangsters so as to encourage white families to migrate from the suburbs to the desert sands where he's erecting a new housing development.Stuart Wilson of "No Escape" plays Jack Travis as a despicable, audacious, greedy, no-holds-barred bad guy. Compared with psycho villain Gary Busey in the original "Lethal Weapon" or urbane Joss Ackland as the South African politician Arjen 'Aryan' Rudd with diplomatic immunity in "Lethal Weapon 2," Wilson is a bad guy, not an S.O.B. When Riggs finally ices him, you don't feel like leaping to your feet and applauding his demise like Ackland's death in "Lethal Weapon 2."Donner substitutes gags for gunplay. You spend more than half of the time laughing at the jokes than ducking the bullets. In the opening gambit, Riggs and Murtaugh fudge with a bomb and flatten an entire building. As the dust and debris settle, the bomb squad arrives. No, our heroes aren't booted off the force. Instead, they are demoted to wearing uniforms and walking a beat. While they're in uniform, they spot a bogus armored car and thwart a robbery. Riggs stumbles onto deadly red armored piercing bullets that can penetrate a bullet-proof vest as if it were Kleenex. Suddenly, the guys find themselves up to their eyes in a classified Internal Affairs investigation headed by newcomer Rene Russo as Lorna Cole. Finally, the Teflon-coated Riggs meets his female match. Russo is a tough-as-nails karate chopping detective with the scars to prove it. The movie's best scene has Riggs and Cole comparing their scars and bullet holes. That's the problem with "Lethal Weapon 3," there is no nail-gun scene like in "Lethal Weapon 2" or the suicide jump in "Lethal Weapon."The third time certainly is not the charm for the guys here. Nothing truly memorable happens. Joe Pesci returns as motor-mouthed Leo Getz, but he spends most of his time running off-screen errands or literally being the butt of Gibson's jokes. The movie takes a sobering turn when Murtaugh has to kill a 15-year old black gang member who was his son's friend. Murtaugh launches a personal crusade to track down Jack Travis, not only because he is selling guns to minors but also marketing cop-killer slugs. The final third of the action is one long chase, first through the L.A. subway onto the L.A. freeway, and evening into Travis' half-built housing complex. Donner, who helmed the first two "Lethal Weapon" movies" as well as "Superman" and "The Omen," is no slouch when it comes to action scenes. Although "Lethal Weapon 3" is a letdown, you won't know it while you're watching its madcap action. Donner supercharges the pace with so much kinetic energy that you forget that it's all been done before. The freeway chase here is straight out of William Friedkin "To Let & Die In L.A" with fewer vehicles on the road.The best thing about "Lethal Weapon 3" is the chemistry between Gibson and Glover. They learn this time out how inseparable they are as partners. Gibson is just as nutty here as he was in the previous "Lethal Weapon" movies. Glover tries to break his partner of his cigarette habit by getting him to eat doggie biscuits. Turns out that Riggs likes the doggie biscuits and cannot get enough of them. Part of the problem with "Lethal Weapon 3" is that neither Gibson nor Glover ever appear to be in jeopardy. You cannot worry about the heroes catching lead if you're laughing your butt off.Nevertheless, for all its faults, "Lethal Weapon 3" is a lot of fun. If you can suffer through the lengthy end credits, Donner and company have a hilarious joke for you.

Lethal Weapon 3 continues to have the great humour, emotion, action and car chases that the franchise delivers. Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Joe Pesci give great performances again and Rene Russo is a welcome addition. Richard Donner's direction is great once again. The music by Michael Kamen, David Sandborn and Eric Clapton is once again really good. However, the franchise formula that it follows is becoming predictable.

Many films fall from grace in regards to sequels. Lethal Weapon started very good, got great with #2 and then fell below the first one with the third installment, cleverly titled: Lethal Weapon 3.Not that Lethal Weapon 3's all that bad. It's got its comedy, fantastic, though sporadic, action sequences – always nice to see real action in movies over the CGI world of today, and it's got the chemistry still in place between the two leads: Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover.) Unfortunately, what it suffers most from: probably one of the most aimless scripts of all time. This film was all over the place, as if the actors were told, via speakerphone because Director Donner had to be on some holiday spending his check he probably received immediately following #2, just do what you want, say what you think and cough it up. That last part nailed my point when one character, the infamous psychologist from the series played by Mary Ellen Trainor either has a cold, or her explanation of her coughing was cut from the final film.Further proving my critique, the movie is about armored piercing bullets, or cop killers, gangs, retirement, filming a movie, a land project, a new romance, an unwanted romance, an ex-cop, sublingual messages again – SEE: the Murtaugh's new dog, selling homes, the internal affairs department, or police police and the word word. And it jumps from one of these to the next without ease, warning or reason. Sure, they get to the point, but mostly it was about the cast reuniting for some more fun, of their own.You'll have fun, too, but at the cost of trying to sort things out. It's best to leave your brain at the door, just sit back and watch the few action scenes, like the enormously irrelevant but exciting explosion that opens the film. The humor's there – Gibson definitely had it, Glover played a more subdued straight man and Pesci's played his role all over again from #2.This viewing, however, reminded me a lot of the magic I felt when I first watched it, probably a dozen or more times when I was much younger. I forgot some of the lines I've used in real life, like "Kelly's pool hall. Kelly speaking." Yep, I've actually answered the phone with that. Or "It's the Police, Police." – I used to work in Quality Assurance, whereas I listened to phone calls of the customer service representatives of my firm and so I called my department the "Police, Police." Also, I've used "Why? Am I getting to you? Am I getting to you?" I guess the trend is, they love to repeat themselves. Word. Word.You could do a lot worse and if you try and jump past the Murtaugh feeling sorry for himself + the funeral scene, both of which took up entirely too much of the picture, you might have some fun. But take heed: as humorous and action packed some scenes are, this is a huge step down from #2 but a nice companion. I just wished they knew when to throw in the towel and quit here

The most popular team of detectives in cinematic history is back again, making the streets of Los Angeles safe and secure for the citizens at large in `Lethal Weapon 3,' directed by Richard Donner and once again starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.  This time the action literally starts with a bang (a big one) when Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) answer a call and, suffice to say, Riggs can't wait for the bomb squad to arrive.  It makes for a spectacular opening scene, but it's just a warm up for what follows.  Some bad things are going down in the City of Angels, perhaps not unusual for L.A., but someone is putting automatic weapons and armor piercing bullets (called `Cop Killers' as they can penetrate a bullet proof vest) on the streets, which is really bad news for police officers in general, and especially for those in particular areas of the city.  Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case, but it quickly escalates, and because of certain untoward circumstances soon falls into the hands of Internal Affairs.  Which brings Officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) into the picture.  And sparks begin to fly. 	The first two installments of this series are hard to beat, but as they say, the third time's a charm; and Donner must have had the shaman working with him on this one, because he pulled off quite a feat-- making a third that ranks right up there with the first two.  He seems to have found the perfect balance with this one; the main characters are in place and established, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) is back, and the addition of Russo is the icing on the cake.  The story is good, there's plenty of great action and some sensational stunts, and the humor has been toned down a notch, which increases the level of intensity of the drama.  In short, Donner measures out all of the right elements to perfection and makes it all gel together for the complete package.  And what a package it is. 	By now, Gibson IS Riggs, from the inside out; still somewhat on the edge, but not quite as volatile.  And Glover could play Murtaugh in his sleep; which may sound like easy street for an actor, but it takes real professionals to maintain the credibility of characters they know so well (it would be so easy to phone it in and let the details slip at this point), and these two have what it takes.  Their chemistry remains intact, and they've put polish on an act that was already shining.  The real chemistry this time, however, is between Gibson and Russo, who click from the beginning, starting with their first scene together.  Russo sparkles as Lorna, putting some real style and spunk into her; there's just enough edginess to her to make her believable as a no-nonsense I.A. investigator, and it makes her the perfect match for Gibson's Riggs.  There's a terrific scene between them, in which they compare battle scars, that fits their characters so well and so credibly underscores the development of their relationship.  it's a memorable scene, and a good example of how well the script, by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen, was written. 	The supporting cast includes Darlene Love (Trish), Traci Wolfe (Rianne), Stuart Wilson (Jack Travis), Steve Kahan (Capt. Murphy), Damon Hines (Nick), Ebonie Smith (Carrie) and Gregory Millar (Tyrone).  In the world of the Cinema, it's a rare thing when a sequel matches up to the original, and when the third does, it's a real triumph; and `Lethal Weapon 3' is just that, a triumph.  It's a quality action/drama that exemplifies why this series is so popular.  Simply put, it's a good movie on it's own, and part of a great series; so don't stop now, `Lethal Weapon 4' is ready and waiting for you. I rate his one 10/10.

I caught this movie on TV a few days ago, so I may as well voice my opinion. I've enjoyed all the "Lethal Weapon" flicks and I hope one day to buy a boxed set of DVDs containing all four in the series.  Don't ask which one I think is best.  They're all lots of fun to watch.  Of course, the original didn't have as much humor as its sequels.  Mel Gibson's character was a downtrodden loner, who was established as a "loose cannon."  But as the series continued, he suddenly turned into Buddy Hackett, cracking jokes left and right.  Needless to say, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make one of the best on-screen duos in the history of film.  Their characters of Riggs and Murtaugh are like polar opposites, but that's the beauty of it.  That's the essence of the buddy cop genre.  The two partners are always at each other's throats, yet they share a great bond and deliver much humor.  Richard Donner is a spectacular action film director, and there are some breathtaking stunts.  The opening truck chase is extremely memorable. 
And each and every scene is buoyed by great comic relief.  Gibson says a great line when he arrests the fraudulent truck driver:  "You have the right to remain unconscious.  Whatever you say...ain't gonna be much."  That's a priceless line!  OK, so the plot is meandering.  There are scenes that are very entertaining, yet don't really move the story along.  But the whole movie is so funny and exciting that I just think...who gives a damn?  I'm having too much fun! 
Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz, adds additional comic relief.  His bleached blond do is hilarious enough, and his nebbish schtick makes it all the more humorous.  Rene Russo is also added to the cast, to provide some good eye candy.  Just like the Bond girls, there's always a sexy love interest in the "Lethal Weapon" movies.  In the second movie, there was Patsy Kensit. 
And there are some human elements to the story.  Danny Glover's Murtaugh still thinks "he's getting too old for this s**t" and is about to retire. He's suffering a severe middle-age crisis and to add to his problems, he ends up killing one of his son's friends--which he did out of self-defense. Sometimes I think Glover's acting talent is underrated.  And though this is a fluffy action/comedy, he delivers the kind of powerful performance he would in any Oscar-winning masterpiece.  "Lethal Weapon 3" again showcases the immense talent of its two irreplacable leads.  This sequel packs a lethal punch and delivers first-class entertainment from start to finish.  And I love that Eric Clapton/Sting song "It's Gonna Be Me."  My score:  8 (out of 10)

So this is the one where it all seems to get to be a lil much. Like wherever Murtagh and Riggs go there is trouble. It's still effective but a bit silly. This time around the baddie is quite generic, an ex cop selling confiscated weapons and police killing ammunition. Sure the guys are great but the real joy here is Renee Russo as Riggs new love interest. She's an IA officer whose bad ass and can hold her own. The interplay and chemistry between her and Riggs is great. But all the other stuff feels a lil silly at times. That being said it's still really fun and the last action setpiece in the housing development is quite fun and suspenseful. But the formula starts to feel a bit old. It's a low point for the franchise but it's still pretty damn good and that's all due to the charismatic cast.

Our friends Los Angeles policemen Martin Riggs(Mel Gibson) and and his methodical pal Roger Murtaugh(Danny Glover now are patrolling through the streets after a botcher explosion caused into a building. Roger is about to retire when they encounter themselves into a dangerous case. A previous police named Leo(Stuart Wilson) turned into criminal kingpin and heinous weapons smuggling. Meanwhile Martin falls in love with a tough police(Rene Russo) from Internal Affairs.This fast paced picture packs noisy supercharged action scenes ,thrills, loud pursuits, lot of violence and murders.The wacky police Gibson, always on the edge, and his partner the gentle and good father Glover again give nice performances with special chemistry between the two actors. They go after and run afoul a nasty villain well played by Stuart Wilson, including to Joe Pesci as likable swindler. Furthermore appear as secondaries Mark Pellegrino, Nick Chunlund,Alan Scarfe and unbilled , the director's wife and also producer: Lauren Shuler Donner as a nurse and the director Stephen T. Kay as a filmmaker. Colorful cinematography by equally director Jan De Bont and atmospheric musical score by Michael Kamen , accompanied by catching song by Eric Clapton. Richard Donner directs with fair-play and the result is quite entertaining. Acceptable and passable movie for enthusiastic of the series won't be disappointed. It's followed by the last chapter 'Lethal weapon 4' with same players adding to Jet Li and Chris Rock.

Riggs and Murtaugh arrest a man on gun charges just for him to be killed in the interrogation room by ex-cop Jack Travis.  Travis is running illegal guns.  Riggs and Murtaugh team up with IA officer Cole to track down and stop Travis while Murtaugh also faces trouble at home as the illegal guns impact on his family.This third in the series is a lot more polished and refined than the first two - there's a lot of money riding on this now!  The story is quite good but it's not rocket science.  It's really all an excuse to have a series of set pieces - from a building being destroyed to a desert showdown.  The romance between Riggs and Cole take away from Riggs' madman style character and makes the film a lot softer.  It also makes the action scenes a lot less believable as he seems to revert to action hero on cue.  However it does allow some humour.  The involvement of Pesci is funny but at times it's a little stretched.Gibson and Murtaugh are good, mainly because they're just having fun now in well worn characters - like old shoes!  Pesci is not quite as annoying as he was in LW2 but is still a bit of a spare wheel.  Russo is good as the love interest and handles herself well.Overall it's good fun but it lacks the dark, rough tone that made LW such a hit in the first place.

This is a great series! Actually I could stop right here because I have already said what needs to be said but just for people's enjoyment I'll elaborate a little.The acting is, much like in the two previous films, excellent. Somehow Mel Gibson and Danny Glover never seem to get tired of each other and it shows because their playful banter never seems to get tiring to the audience. Mel Gibson is a class actor and this time around he develops the character of Martin Riggs even further than he did in the second film. He is so good at portraying emotions that the audience genuinely feels with him. When he is angry you feel his anger and when he is sad you feel sad, you get the picture. The fact that he is so versatile shows in the contrasts of the character. He is both great in action-sequences and in romantic sequences. As for Danny Glover he also does a great job in bringing his character further and he really does in this installment because you get to see the more negative sides of the character this time around. In the first two films he was the character who didn't evolve much but took pride in it. This time, because retirement is rearing its ugly head, we get to see, what I must suppose was, the facade stripped away and see Murtaugh in his raw, pure form. Joe Pesci also returns this time for the comic relief and he is still funny. There is just something about the character of Leo Getz that is incredibly entertaining. However, the best performance is perhaps done by Stuart Wilson, an incredibly underrated actor who has sadly never really achieved a commercial breakthrough. He is the villain of this film and is perhaps the best villain of the series simply because he has more depth than any other villain in the series. He is also given considerably more screen time than many of the other villains so he really has a chance to shine. Rene Russo appears in this film as Riggs new romantic interest and she may not be the most gifted actress ever to be on film but her chemistry with Mel Gibson is undeniable and her on-screen presence is pretty amazing considering that she is a new entry to the character gallery.The story of the film is the weakest out of all the series (yes even the fourth one) and sometimes it kinda drags. Mainly, however, the story is still highly entertaining and funny. The best element of the script is the fact that villain is an ex-cop this time around and that does that the heroes can hate the villain even more because he is, aside from being a mean bastard, a traitor, almost a symbol of the back-side of the medallion.The action of the film is just like in the two previous movies absolutely brilliant. The action is highly entertaining and well made and Mel Gibson is excellent as an action star as well as many other things.All in all a great entry to a great series. 7/10

'Lethal Weapon 3' has the best opening sequence of all 'Lethal Weapon'-movies, although the opening of the fourth installment comes close. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) try to disable a bomb and what happens in the end can probably only happen in a movie like this. It is hilarious and spectacular anyway.The movie starts eight days before Murtaugh's retirement. He and Riggs must find an ex-cop named Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson). He steals weapons and ammunition from the police. At first they thought it was an inside job so Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) from Internal Affairs is put on the case. She is the perfect match for Riggs, beautiful but tough. We also meet Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) again. He kind of helps them with this case and again he is very good for the comedy.This is a fine installment although things get more and more familiar. Still, as long as it is spectacular and funny that doesn't really matter. The fun Gibson, Glover and director Richard Donner must have making this movie is clearly visible on the screen.

Plot In A Paragraph: Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover) pursue a former L.A.P.D. lieutenant turned ruthless arms dealer, during the six days prior to Murtaugh's retirement.There is a massive drop in quality from the first two movies, and I think it is not helped by a lame villain. Rene Russo is a good addition to the cast though. This is a much watered down Lethal Weapon movie compared to the first two movies, and for this Zoner, Lethal Weapon 3 is the low point of the franchise for me. The lack of Shane Black is obvious. They up the comedy even more this time, and it falls a bit flat for me. The humour in the first two was great, this has a female security guard chasing Murtaugh around whilst Riggs is tricking him into kicking water coolers over. Riggs is an absolute jerk at times in this one!! Gone is the man overcome with grief, looking for a reason to get through the day and is dangerously unpredictable as a result. Instead we get someone who eats raw onions and dog biscuits, threatens Jaywalkers with his gun, beats up movie directors, knocks out handcuffed suspects and makes random guesses on what Wire to cut on a bomb!! And that's without mention his treatment of his best friend and partner Murtaugh.He constantly berates him about retiring despite it being the sensible option. Especially since he can't dress himself without accidentally setting off his gun. Riggs repeatedly put him in unnecessary danger. Surely Riggs should want his best friend safe at home with his family, out of danger. But no, he is incredibly selfish!! Joe Pesci who I loved in the last one, is awful here. There is no reason for him to be here and he's just irritating. Does the movie director Riggs assaults remind anyone of Steven Spielberg?? Lethal Weapon 3 grossed $144 million to finish the 4th highest grossing movie of 1992.

Richard Donner again directs Riggs and Murtaugh in another action adventure worthy of the title.Rene Russo is introduced as Lorna Cole (internal affairs) and clashes with Riggs and Murtaugh on the investigation of an arms dealer (Jack Travis) Cole and Riggs begin to see eye to eye as their relationship takes shape, while Murtaugh is torn apart after killing his sons best friend in a kill or be killed shoot out.Chasing the man who put the gun the boys hand the three join forces and face the arsenal of armour piercing bullets being fed on to the streets (cop killers)Pesci's character takes a back seat but still provides some laughs in this successful extension of the series.Not as good as the first 2 films, but still good 7/10

Even though this is in my opinion the weakest out of the Lethal Weapon series, that of course doesn't mean that this movie isn't fun and entertaining to watch.It suffers from the same minor flaws as the previous 2 Lethal Weapon movies. The story is incredibly simple, standard action material. It's totally uninteresting and also told in a totally uninteresting way. Also the villain is yet again heavily underused. But it's true that none of the Lethal Weapon movies have ever relied on its story. Instead the movie heavily relies on its two main character; Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. And when you have two such characters like Riggs and Murtaugh, who have such an amazing chemistry together, you just don't need much else to make a good and entertaining movie.Unfortunately the movie does nowhere live up to its fantastic and memorable beginning. Everything that happens after the opening sequence isn't really that interesting or memorable. The movie doesn't always have the right pace and the way the story is presented make it seem even less interesting than it is on paper.The movie is filled with some great characters next besides to the two main leads. Joe Pesci returns as Leo Getz and Rene Russo joins the team as a woman who knows how to take care of herself. The villain is this time played by the always great Stuart Wilson. It however is unfortunate that all of these characters are given too little screen time, especially Joe Pesci and Stuart Wilson. All of the Lethal Weapon movies always had great villains, that were also at the same time always heavily underused. Same goes for Wilson in this particular case, who's talent is practically wasted.But luckily the movie is still of course a perfectly entertaining one. This is absolutely thanks to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who still have the magic chemistry together, after already 2 Lethal Weapon movies. The two of them provide some great and hilarious moments together, that alone is reason enough why this movie is a good and enjoyable one to watch.Maybe not as good- but certainly just as entertaining as all of the other Lethal Weapon movies.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a buddy cop action movie the third sequel in the "Lethal Weapon" series, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon 3 (1992) is for my opinion the second best in the series! I love this flick, I always have enjoyed much more than I did Lethal Weapon 2. I love this sequel, I think is so much better than Lethal Weapon 2! Because the second installment in the series was way too violent movie from the first one, this one was just fun action sequel to the first one and I love it so much! I thought Donner kept the level going for the most part throughout the films!!! Why don't people like the last two movies!! I pretty stayed up half the night for two nights in a row because I got so hooked with these movies!. I especially love Rene Russo she's so sexy, sassy, and kicks a lot of ass in it. A nice addition to the team. Rene Russo in this movie she was the second crush I had on her. She was the most beautiful girl playing a tough cop ever. I was happy her character was not killed off, by the end of the movie. When the film ended I was really sad because I didn't know what happened too Martin Riggs and Lorna Cole, did their romance lasted forever. I was always hooked up and when I hared they are making Lethal Weapon 4 in 1998, I couldn't wait for the fourth installment! I grew up with this movie and it is my childhood movie of all time I love it to death!!!Rock on Riggs and Murtaugh! Perhaps as a reflection of that, "Weapon 3" depends more on chases, explosions and set pieces than it does on character development. The story again involves the partnership of Riggs and Murtaugh (Gibson and Glover), buddies in the long tradition of movie cop partners. This time Murtaugh is only eight days from retirement, a sure sign in any cop movie that his life will be repeatedly in danger. I remember Lethal Weapon 3 was a lot of fun and I would say it's my 2nd favorite of the series. Stuart Wilson was a good bad guy, humor was great including the banter. It's an entertaining sequel. I know a lot of people don't like this movie like I do a lot of fans prefer Lethal Weapon 2 over this flick, I don't! I think 1 and 3 are great flicks, 2 is my third favorite film in the franchise!!! Part 1 and 3 of Lethal Weapon I absolutely love! I enjoyed Lethal Weapon 2, I like Lethal Weapon 4. I really love Lethal Weapon 3, I always had fun with it. I highly enjoy it. I don't mind the story, a lot of people complain about the story. I think that story is very interesting. I think Joe Pesci has more screen time in this movie than in part 2. I love when Riggs cut the wrong wire in the opening scene and the whole Building Explodes. They both grabbed the cat and they save the cat ha ha. Than they went on patrol officer now, not anymore detectives. This movie is fun back and forth. The armored car is driven by this crooks and Riggs is chasing it. Riggs eventually has to brake the vehicle hard, causing the armored car to come to a sudden stop, resulting in the bad guy flying through the windshield and coming to rest on the hood and say my favorite line. "You have the right to remain unconscious. Anything you say ain't gonna be much." And Riggs punches the guy in the windshield and says "Back to bed. Back to bed." The car chase scene Riggs jumps off the subway and commandeers an LAPD motorcycle, then continues his pursuit of the truck, which has by then left the rails and taken to the streets. Riggs pursues Travis on the wrong side of a freeway, then into a section that was under construction. Travis manages to get stopped, but Riggs flies off an unfinished ramp, getting hung up by some cables. The cables give way, and he falls through several platforms, to the ground. This scene is Excellent and outstanding stunt, I can always watch that! The scene in the hockey arena is one of my favorite when Leo (Joe Pesci) wrestles with Jack Travis (Staurt Wilson) Their struggle carries them onto the ice and Travis shoots Leo in the arm. Riggs follows Travis out of the arena, but loses him. That scene Riggis running on the ice was fantastic. The end fight scene when Murtaugh takes out Walters, then tosses Darryl's gun to Riggs, loaded with the cop killer bullets. Riggs shoots through the bucket of the front-end loader, killing Travis was awesome! This movie is awesome and it is my favorite film in the "Lethal Weapon" series. It is a 10 for me. Lethal Weapon 3 is the third installment in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. The 1992 action sequel has Detective Sergeants Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) under the eye of an Internal Affairs detective (Rene Russo) during an investigation of a former cop who is dealing in illegal arms and armor-piercing ammunition. The film also stars Joe Pesci and Stuart Wilson. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Warner Bros.

The first 'Lethal Weapon' wasn't perfect, but it is still a very good film and important to the development of the buddy-cop film as well as being one of the best examples. Its first sequel is almost as good, if just missing out on being on the same level or surpassing it.'Lethal Weapon 3' is fun enough, and there is plenty to enjoy, but after the impressive first two films it was somewhat of a let-down. It didn't feel as fresh and had a ran out of ideas feel sometimes. Its weak link is the story, which does have some exciting moments and some good scenes but the first two films were much more focused and tight in plotting, here the story does meander in places and parts drag. Some of the dialogue is a lot of fun, some of it is repetitive and convoluted with a little too much emphasis at times on humour.After being such a delight in the second film, Joe Pesci returns and one was hoping he would be a welcome presence. Sadly count me in as one of the people who found him underused, his character merely being a plot device and Pesci being irritating this time round (the first time ever he's had that effect on me). Was mixed on the villain, Stuart Wilson does enjoy himself immensely and does bring a sinister edge to easily the best acted head villain in comparison to the first two films where the henchmen were more memorable and better played. The character himself was a little sketchy in development however and he could have been used more.However, the way 'Lethal Weapon 3' is shot and designed screams slick and stylish while Richard Donner once again directs with an assured hand. The score is atmospheric and groovy.Parts of the script doe entertain hugely and crackle in wit and tension.Once again, the action is slick and bursts with excitement and tension, with terrific stunts and the sheer scale of them being worthy of huge admiration. It is very easy to see why the chalk and cheese chemistry of the polar opposite characters of Riggs and Murtaugh became so popular, very rarely in a buddy-cop film has this kind of chemistry been so entertaining and perfectly pitched.Mel Gibson continues to excel in a performance as witty and intense has before. Danny Glover gives Murtaugh the right amount of spirit, subtlety and no-nonsense attitude. Rene Russo brings some much needed freshness and gives a strong performance.In summary, fun but the magic is not quite there for me. Not one of the best sequels there is, but hardly a disgrace and nowhere near among the worst. 6/10 Bethany Cox

Lethal Weapon 3 is the thrid film in the series and just as good. Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and the funny Joe Pesci are all back for the fun. This time they add the sexy Rene Russo to the mix who can hang with Riggs and is just as crazy. Underreated actor Stuart Wilson makes another good bad guy in this good sequel.

Our Rover Boys Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are riding high again. They both lose their sergeant's stripes again over their recklessness, but when they stop an armored car heist and take a prisoner, they uncover a really nasty smuggling and arms dealing racket masterminded by a cop who just went over the hill.According to LAPD's Internal Affairs Stuart Wilson racked up more complaints than about any cop on record, he was effective but reckless and brutal. Wilson just one day on a stakeout went over the hill, left after saying he was going for coffee. Just went over the bad guys, Job abandonment reaches a new high.In fact Wilson is one of the slimiest villains ever in the history of cinema. The seriousness of this guy is almost jarringly out of place with Legal Weapon style hijinks.Mel Gibson gets a surprise in that Rene Russo whom he initially thought was an uptight IA cop turns out to be the woman he's been waiting for since his wife died. The girl has some moves.One small performance you should note, that of Jason Rainwater of a young idealistic cop who tags after Gibson and Glover and gets killed in the fight with Wilson and his crew. A touching death scene that will bring a tear to the eye.

Has any movie franchise sunk as far and as rapidly as the Lethal Weapon series did with Part 3? The original film and its first sequel always had an element of comedy to go with the gritty action, but in this third instalment the humour is brought to the fore (and the nastiness toned down); the result is absolutely cringe-worthy, as tough cops Riggs and Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover) are regularly turned into incompetent clowns for the amusement of a younger demographic.From the opening scene in which Riggs stupidly attempts to diffuse a bomb with disastrous results, to the end credits sequence in which Riggs, clearly having not learnt his lesson, considers diffusing yet another bomb, Lethal Weapon 3 is an embarrassment to the action genre. Jeffery Boam, who did such a good job with Part 2, completely screws up here, his plot being predictable and dull and the characters frequently acting against type just for laughs. Worse still, Boam brings back shifty Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), making him even more obnoxious and irritating than before.Once again, Riggs is given a love interest—internal affairs cop Lorna Cole (Rene Russo)—but this chapter being a tamer affair aimed at the whole family, she doesn't get a sex scene (thankfully sparing the viewer yet another Mel Gibson ass shot) and doesn't wind up swimming with the fishes like poor old Patsy Kensit's Rika; instead, Lorna joins in with the crime-fighting fun, proving to be as handy with her fists and guns as the guys. All of this nonsense is accompanied by the series' terrible signature sax and guitar score, which only goes to make matters even more intolerable.

This is undeniably the funniest of the first three films in the series. (After this one, I had no desire to see the fourth.)  But laughs alone are not enough to carry an action movie.  So let's throw in a lot of cool stunts.  Okay, now we've got enough to entertain viewers for two hours, so why add anything else?  I mean, we don't actually *need* to have a strong villain or emotional depth for the characters do we?   Well, we don't if we're just looking for a couple of hours of escapism. In that role, this movie delivers.  Mel Gibson made me laugh in this movie, despite the utter silliness of the humor.  The stunts kept me on the edge of my seat.  What can I say?  For two hours I had a good time.   But through it all, I still felt empty somehow.  And as I left the theater, I actually looked back and asked myself, "Did I just see a movie?"

This is the third installment of the Lethal Weapon franchise and what usually happens around this point is the creators are just kind of reusing all the ideas just to make money. This one was in that category..It was not all bad it still had all the fun and action of Riggs and Murtaugh teaming up but we have seen it twice before and they just switch the story line slightly.This movie is about Riggs and Murtaugh who try to bust an Ex cop who is now a arms dealer. They go on the case and in the meantime Riggs might have found a love interest.This was a good movie just not as good as the first. Granted if you saw this one second instead of the second one this one would probably be bette its just the same thing as the other two so still good but nothing new here.

Director Richard Donner's "Lethal Weapon 3" qualifies as a sloppily-scripted, slam-bang actioneer with all the subtlety of a brick through a plate glass window. Nevertheless, if you aren't too picky about its problems, "Lethal Weapon 3" can be a lot of fun to watch. Mel Gibson reprises his role as the looney Sgt. Martin Riggs along with Danny Glover as his partner Sgt. Roger Murtaugh. When the movie opens, we learn that Murtaugh has eight days to go before he retires from the LAPD. Staying alive that long around his crazy partner, Sgt. Murtaugh realizes, will take a miracle."Lethal Weapon 3" desperately needs more than a miracle. What is needs is a good plot and a villain you can love to hate. The second sequel in this entertaining police series as not as potent as its predecessors. If anything, "Lethal Weapon 3" is a third less filling. "Lethal Weapon 2" scenarist Jeffrey Boam appears to be running low on fresh ideas. He looks like he borrowed the plot from the 1974 John Sturges' movie "McQ," with John Wayne. This time around the bad guy is a dirty, ex-cop selling contraband machine guns to black street gangsters so as to encourage white families to migrate from the suburbs to the desert sands where he's erecting a new housing development.Stuart Wilson of "No Escape" plays Jack Travis as a despicable, audacious, greedy, no-holds-barred bad guy. Compared with psycho villain Gary Busey in the original "Lethal Weapon" or urbane Joss Ackland as the South African politician Arjen 'Aryan' Rudd with diplomatic immunity in "Lethal Weapon 2," Wilson is a bad guy, not an S.O.B. When Riggs finally ices him, you don't feel like leaping to your feet and applauding his demise like Ackland's death in "Lethal Weapon 2."Donner substitutes gags for gunplay. You spend more than half of the time laughing at the jokes than ducking the bullets. In the opening gambit, Riggs and Murtaugh fudge with a bomb and flatten an entire building. As the dust and debris settle, the bomb squad arrives. No, our heroes aren't booted off the force. Instead, they are demoted to wearing uniforms and walking a beat. While they're in uniform, they spot a bogus armored car and thwart a robbery. Riggs stumbles onto deadly red armored piercing bullets that can penetrate a bullet-proof vest as if it were Kleenex. Suddenly, the guys find themselves up to their eyes in a classified Internal Affairs investigation headed by newcomer Rene Russo as Lorna Cole. Finally, the Teflon-coated Riggs meets his female match. Russo is a tough-as-nails karate chopping detective with the scars to prove it. The movie's best scene has Riggs and Cole comparing their scars and bullet holes. That's the problem with "Lethal Weapon 3," there is no nail-gun scene like in "Lethal Weapon 2" or the suicide jump in "Lethal Weapon."The third time certainly is not the charm for the guys here. Nothing truly memorable happens. Joe Pesci returns as motor-mouthed Leo Getz, but he spends most of his time running off-screen errands or literally being the butt of Gibson's jokes. The movie takes a sobering turn when Murtaugh has to kill a 15-year old black gang member who was his son's friend. Murtaugh launches a personal crusade to track down Jack Travis, not only because he is selling guns to minors but also marketing cop-killer slugs. The final third of the action is one long chase, first through the L.A. subway onto the L.A. freeway, and evening into Travis' half-built housing complex. Donner, who helmed the first two "Lethal Weapon" movies" as well as "Superman" and "The Omen," is no slouch when it comes to action scenes. Although "Lethal Weapon 3" is a letdown, you won't know it while you're watching its madcap action. Donner supercharges the pace with so much kinetic energy that you forget that it's all been done before. The freeway chase here is straight out of William Friedkin "To Let & Die In L.A" with fewer vehicles on the road.The best thing about "Lethal Weapon 3" is the chemistry between Gibson and Glover. They learn this time out how inseparable they are as partners. Gibson is just as nutty here as he was in the previous "Lethal Weapon" movies. Glover tries to break his partner of his cigarette habit by getting him to eat doggie biscuits. Turns out that Riggs likes the doggie biscuits and cannot get enough of them. Part of the problem with "Lethal Weapon 3" is that neither Gibson nor Glover ever appear to be in jeopardy. You cannot worry about the heroes catching lead if you're laughing your butt off.Nevertheless, for all its faults, "Lethal Weapon 3" is a lot of fun. If you can suffer through the lengthy end credits, Donner and company have a hilarious joke for you.

Not a bad movie. It was entertaining, was it great? No. The best part of the movie wasn't the plot, but one guy Leo Getz. He was funny in this movie. Glad they had him in it.

The dynamic duo of Riggs & Murtaugh is back and ready to rock-n-roll...again. I'm not going to lie, this one would probably rank as #3 in the Lethal Weapon filmography. It's got some great moments, but it also has a few moments that really fall flat.Starting with the strengths. The saving grace of this film for me is Roger Murtaugh, he ultimately carries the bulk of the emotion throughout the film. The whole dynamic of Father/Son and the decision that impacts him so deeply is superb acting by Danny Glover. The relationship between Riggs and Cole is fantastic as well. It's Riggs showing his willingness to have a real connection since the passing of his wife. They also work great as a combo having similar personality traits and attitudes.The negatives. Riggs and Cole have a dynamic relationship, but it gets too serious too fast, they go from not trusting each other at the beginning of the week to being "Honey" and "Sweetie" by the end of the week. I know that near-death situations can cause someone to have altered decisions, but they are both used to high-intensity situations. They shouldn't have moved that quickly. The villain seemed really bland, I know it's an ex-cop and that he has insider details to weaponry, but ultimately the character didn't really add that much to the plot.I really like the series and even though this isn't my favorite one in the series I'll continue to watch. I'm a fan.

Richard Donner continues the adventures of Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and his eternal partner Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), in what is yet another escapist adventure, uncompromising and fun, within the subgenre of police films. This would be the end of a trilogy for the series. There was, during the 5 years that separate the first and the third film, a good job of maturing the characters, even though the script of this third one is the weakest of the whole series.After causing a building to explode, partners Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh are demoted to street guards. The duo has a chance to turn the tide when they investigate, with the help of officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), a police gun theft. The scheme is being run by a corrupt former police officer, who kills anyone who decides to open his mouth.The series has always been dedicated and exploring the relationship between detectives Murtaugh and Riggs, and the third film is no different. In this, we see Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) already 50 years old and a week from his retirement from the homicide department. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), despite not making that clear during most of the film, resents losing his partner and fears of ending their friendship as well. Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) returns to "assist" the duo once again and we also have the addition of detective Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), a detective from the internal affairs department who works on an investigation into Murtaugh and is forced to help in the mission of the pair of detectives. Almost as "deadly" as Martin Riggs, Lorna makes up the quartet that hunts Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson) and tries to prevent him from getting away with selling stolen weapons from the Los Angeles police depot.Lethal Weapon is a saga about aging and family. Both aspects are presented since its first episode in 1987, being further explored in this one. Despite the playful tone and the addition of Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), basically an artifice of the script to make a feminine counterpoint to Riggs, there are heavy themes proposed on screen, such as the huge incidence of young blacks in organized crime, with terrible consequences for the veteran police officer, who finds himself guilty of shooting a fellow man who, to make matters worse, had direct contact with his son. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam and Rober Mark Keman remains consistent with the whole narrative skeleton that Shane Black built, harmoniously uniting a fantasy action, typically familiar humor supported by a very intimate actor direction, established by Donner.It is important to highlight that if the Lethal Weapon 2 presented some novelties that avoided the feeling of "more of the same", this Lethal Weapon 3 does not present the same freshness, giving the feeling that it simply repeats the formula of the previous films. Fortunately, "Lethal weapon" is a series that depends very little on the plot of each film, basing its success on the excellent mix of action and comedy employed by Richard Donner, and, mainly, on the chemistry of his cop team, thanks to the exceptional rapport Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Thus, if the weakened villains and the story are too simple to harm the narrative, the strength of the action scenes constantly interspersed with moments of good humor and the dynamic relationship of the main duo guarantee the success of the film.This third episode addresses again, albeit superficially, the theme of retirement, illustrating the cruel dilemma that everyone faces when approaching the time to stop doing what they like. This interesting subtext is even more evident, obviously, because now Roger is much closer to retiring (more precisely, there are eight days when the narrative begins). This way, Danny Glover for the first time has more prominence than Mel Gibson, by illustrating very well the discomfort that the character feels, for example, through his already traditional phrase "I am too old for that", something reflected also when he answers the question "Did you cut yourself? Old blade? With two dry and direct words: "Old face". The actor shows competence even when Roger worries about his son Nick (Damon Hines), desperately trying to maintain the lost intimacy with the boy through the pathetic joke he makes with the slang words his son uses in his daily life. The situation only gets worse when he accidentally kills a friend of Nick's, which leads us to the best dramatic scene of the film, when Riggs shows his friend that he was not to blame for the murder, proving once again their strong friendship. Relief comes to Roger only when his son says he doesn't blame him, taking an enormous weight off his back and giving him back his motivation.Richard Donner is once again able to balance the exciting action sequences with moments worthy of good comedy films, something remarkable from the first scene of this "Lethal weapon 3", when the conflict between Riggs' impulsiveness and Murtaugh's conservatism takes us into a building surrounded by the police due to the suspicion of a bomb and gives us one of the most emblematic scenes in the series. The director is also competent in conducting the great action scenes, such as the chase with vans at high speed, also full of hints of good humor, thanks to the friendly Delores, interpreted with charisma by Delores Hall, or the exciting chase that begins in the metro, goes out into the streets with Riggs on a motorbike (and against the grain!) and ends with him hanging from a bridge. In this scene, observe the dynamic alternation between aerial planes, close-ups and subjective planes, which place us under Riggs' point of view.Donner is also skilled in the camera movements that throw us into the plot, like the camera that accompanies Riggs and Roger in the shooting that results in the death of Darryl (Bobby Wynn), in addition to using these same movements to convey sensations, as in zoom out which decreases Roger on the screen after this shooting, illustrating the policeman's distress after killing the boy. And finally, Richard Donner shows talent in directing the funny scenes, like when Riggs interrupts the filming of a film and gets in the way of Rianne (Traci Wolfe), trying to immediately recover the girl's job in his own way, or when Leo (Joe Pesci) takes shot on the hockey court and taken to the hospital.To maintain this relaxed atmosphere, Donner also maintained some of the main flaws of the series, such as the less likely situations, such as when ex-lieutenant Travis (Stuart Wilson) enters the police station without being searched, goes to the living room, kills the arrested burglar in front of from the cameras and leaves quietly, and the villains weakened by the lightness of the narrative, something evidenced when Lorna (Rene Russo) and Riggs invade a house, beat all the bandits and flee with their guns and their dog.Gibson and Glover maintain the incredible rapport of the previous films, making that friendship practically palpable to the viewer, who still bears in mind the memory of everything they lived, giving the friendship between Riggs and Roger an enormous weight. In addition, the constant games between them give realism to that relationship, because true friends act exactly this way. Riggs remains crazy to the point of playing with a ferocious dog and making friends with him, impressing his new partner Lorna, but he no longer has the same suicidal impulse as before, as he found his place in Roger's family. And although her introduction follows the cliché "fight and then be together", Rene Russo's Lorna is really charming, conquering Riggs with her skills during a fight ("My girl", he says), but also with her direct way of deal with the crazy policeman. Although he does not have the chemistry of Gibson and Glover on the scene, Russo does well and establishes a good partnership with the duo, especially with Mel Gibson, something remarkable from the fun scene where they show the scars on the body and end up sleeping together. Closing the highlights of the cast, Joe Pesci is again hilarious as Leo, with his quick lines and his eager way of dealing with his "friends".The impeccable soundtrack of Eric Clapton, Michael Kamen and David Sanborn, full of jazz and blues, and the clear photography of Jan de Bont, who believes in bright colors and many daytime scenes, remain consistent with the light atmosphere of the series. And the direction of Richard Donner, two other trademarks of the quadrilogy, are repeated in this film. The script and the main plot, which never became protagonists of any film in the series, are left even more aside in this third film, making room for the hilarious dialogues between the characters and the goods of the drama moments with good performances. It would certainly be a good ending to the trilogy for the series, which, as we know, would win a fourth part years later.

Lethal Weapon 3 continues to have the great humour, emotion, action and car chases that the franchise delivers. Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Joe Pesci give great performances again and Rene Russo is a welcome addition. Richard Donner's direction is great once again. The music by Michael Kamen, David Sandborn and Eric Clapton is once again really good. However, the franchise formula that it follows is becoming predictable.

Third installment into the lives of cops Riggs and Murtaugh is a slam bam action film that excels like its previous two successes. Gibson, Glover and Pesci return once again in great form, while Russo makes a grand entrance as a fellow officer and love interest of Riggs. Our heroes take on a corrupt ex-cop in this non stop adventure directed once again by Donner.

The most popular team of detectives in cinematic history is back again, making the streets of Los Angeles safe and secure for the citizens at large in `Lethal Weapon 3,' directed by Richard Donner and once again starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.  This time the action literally starts with a bang (a big one) when Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) answer a call and, suffice to say, Riggs can't wait for the bomb squad to arrive.  It makes for a spectacular opening scene, but it's just a warm up for what follows.  Some bad things are going down in the City of Angels, perhaps not unusual for L.A., but someone is putting automatic weapons and armor piercing bullets (called `Cop Killers' as they can penetrate a bullet proof vest) on the streets, which is really bad news for police officers in general, and especially for those in particular areas of the city.  Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case, but it quickly escalates, and because of certain untoward circumstances soon falls into the hands of Internal Affairs.  Which brings Officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) into the picture.  And sparks begin to fly. 	The first two installments of this series are hard to beat, but as they say, the third time's a charm; and Donner must have had the shaman working with him on this one, because he pulled off quite a feat-- making a third that ranks right up there with the first two.  He seems to have found the perfect balance with this one; the main characters are in place and established, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) is back, and the addition of Russo is the icing on the cake.  The story is good, there's plenty of great action and some sensational stunts, and the humor has been toned down a notch, which increases the level of intensity of the drama.  In short, Donner measures out all of the right elements to perfection and makes it all gel together for the complete package.  And what a package it is. 	By now, Gibson IS Riggs, from the inside out; still somewhat on the edge, but not quite as volatile.  And Glover could play Murtaugh in his sleep; which may sound like easy street for an actor, but it takes real professionals to maintain the credibility of characters they know so well (it would be so easy to phone it in and let the details slip at this point), and these two have what it takes.  Their chemistry remains intact, and they've put polish on an act that was already shining.  The real chemistry this time, however, is between Gibson and Russo, who click from the beginning, starting with their first scene together.  Russo sparkles as Lorna, putting some real style and spunk into her; there's just enough edginess to her to make her believable as a no-nonsense I.A. investigator, and it makes her the perfect match for Gibson's Riggs.  There's a terrific scene between them, in which they compare battle scars, that fits their characters so well and so credibly underscores the development of their relationship.  it's a memorable scene, and a good example of how well the script, by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen, was written. 	The supporting cast includes Darlene Love (Trish), Traci Wolfe (Rianne), Stuart Wilson (Jack Travis), Steve Kahan (Capt. Murphy), Damon Hines (Nick), Ebonie Smith (Carrie) and Gregory Millar (Tyrone).  In the world of the Cinema, it's a rare thing when a sequel matches up to the original, and when the third does, it's a real triumph; and `Lethal Weapon 3' is just that, a triumph.  It's a quality action/drama that exemplifies why this series is so popular.  Simply put, it's a good movie on it's own, and part of a great series; so don't stop now, `Lethal Weapon 4' is ready and waiting for you. I rate his one 10/10.

Many films fall from grace in regards to sequels. Lethal Weapon started very good, got great with #2 and then fell below the first one with the third installment, cleverly titled: Lethal Weapon 3.Not that Lethal Weapon 3's all that bad. It's got its comedy, fantastic, though sporadic, action sequences – always nice to see real action in movies over the CGI world of today, and it's got the chemistry still in place between the two leads: Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover.) Unfortunately, what it suffers most from: probably one of the most aimless scripts of all time. This film was all over the place, as if the actors were told, via speakerphone because Director Donner had to be on some holiday spending his check he probably received immediately following #2, just do what you want, say what you think and cough it up. That last part nailed my point when one character, the infamous psychologist from the series played by Mary Ellen Trainor either has a cold, or her explanation of her coughing was cut from the final film.Further proving my critique, the movie is about armored piercing bullets, or cop killers, gangs, retirement, filming a movie, a land project, a new romance, an unwanted romance, an ex-cop, sublingual messages again – SEE: the Murtaugh's new dog, selling homes, the internal affairs department, or police police and the word word. And it jumps from one of these to the next without ease, warning or reason. Sure, they get to the point, but mostly it was about the cast reuniting for some more fun, of their own.You'll have fun, too, but at the cost of trying to sort things out. It's best to leave your brain at the door, just sit back and watch the few action scenes, like the enormously irrelevant but exciting explosion that opens the film. The humor's there – Gibson definitely had it, Glover played a more subdued straight man and Pesci's played his role all over again from #2.This viewing, however, reminded me a lot of the magic I felt when I first watched it, probably a dozen or more times when I was much younger. I forgot some of the lines I've used in real life, like "Kelly's pool hall. Kelly speaking." Yep, I've actually answered the phone with that. Or "It's the Police, Police." – I used to work in Quality Assurance, whereas I listened to phone calls of the customer service representatives of my firm and so I called my department the "Police, Police." Also, I've used "Why? Am I getting to you? Am I getting to you?" I guess the trend is, they love to repeat themselves. Word. Word.You could do a lot worse and if you try and jump past the Murtaugh feeling sorry for himself + the funeral scene, both of which took up entirely too much of the picture, you might have some fun. But take heed: as humorous and action packed some scenes are, this is a huge step down from #2 but a nice companion. I just wished they knew when to throw in the towel and quit here

After a botched bomb disposal job, Riggs and Murtagh find themselves on foot patrol (which they both aren't happy about). After witnessing a murder at the hands of a bogus security team, Riggs sets off in hot pursuit with Murtagh not far behind in the 'real' security vehicle. Riggs and Murtagh contain the situation following a pursuit and some fisticuffs and arrest the driver Billy Phelps (Mark Pellegrino). When they examine his weapon, it turns out that it is a special type of gun that is able to pierce 'armour'. However, before Riggs and Murtagh manage to question Phelps, a man comes into the police station and shoots Phelps and calmly walks away. Riggs, Murtagh and internal affairs officer Lorna Cole (Russo) discover that Phelps has been shot and promptly examine the CCTV footage where Cole identifies the killer as 'Jack Travis' - a former police officer who is into arms in a big way. Riggs, Murtagh and Cole find that they must all work together to try and find out why Travis has murdered Phelps and how the 2 of them are linked; For me, the main problem with this Lethal Weapon entry is that there is very little in the way of a plot. The plot is basically Travis steals lots of arms and uses them against the police and that's pretty much it. We learn very little about Travis's motivations and we get no background information about him. Why did he get involved with arms? Why did he have a vendetta against the police? Who knows? Second we come to Leo Getz - OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK (sorry I couldn't resist). I thought it was quite refreshing when he was introduced in the second film and found him to be tolerable in that film. Getz character also had more relevance to the plot in LW2. I found his character beyond irritating in this film and what exactly was the point of him being in this film? Oh yeah, he's an Estate Agent. Really? I like Joe Pesci and I've enjoyed every other film that he's been in, but I really couldn't stand him in LW3 - as I mentioned he was tolerable in the second film, but I felt he was a bit OTT here.There were other absurd scenes as well like where Cole and Riggs are both showing each other scars from where they've been shot and injured in various places. Why? Not only was it pointless, but it was also unfunny.At least, LW3 still had its funny moments and the chemistry is still strong between Riggs and Murtagh. As far as entertainment goes, this is good. But if you are the sort of person who enjoys a film with a well thought out and coherent plot then this may come as a disappointment. I gave it 5/10 purely for its entertainment value.
