Laura (Belen Rueda) returns to the orphanage she spent time in as a child with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and little boy Simon (Roger Princep) in hopes of re-establishing it as seaside retreat for children with disabilities only to find there may be some former residents who never left. In Juan Antonio Bayona's tightly wound "The Orphanage" nothing is as it seems and child's play takes on sinister overtones.Bayona belongs to this new wave of Spanish-language directors (most notably Del Torro and Amenabar) who excel when it comes to creating moody atmospheric tales of the supernatural with Catholic overtones. Whereas "Pan's Labyrinth" took a dark fantasy approach to a Passion Play, "The Orphanage" is closer to the classic haunted house themes of "The Others" as it attempts to give a sentimental view of life after death. Be warned, "The Orphanage" is often more sad than scary, and those not familiar with Catholic mysticism might find things a bit hard to believe. As goes the film's mantra...Believe, Then You Will See. Those with the patience and the heart will be greatly rewarded as the audience doesn't necessarily have to Believe to relate to the characters who do.Working from refined "less is more" psychological horror templates, Bayona delivers the formulaic goods. There will be a simplistic but heartfelt exploration of grief. There will be allusions to classic literature (in this case a very nicely done "Peter Pan" as Catholic allegory motif). There will be uncovering dark secrets from the past. There will be precocious children with spooky imaginary friends. There will be creaking set designs and manipulative sound effects to create "gotcha!" moments. There will be a creepy medium (an excellent Geraldine Chaplin) brought in for a séance. And there will be a twist at the end.Thankfully, there is also a great performance from Belen Rueda as Laura. She gives a compelling portrayal of a woman devoured by her loss and achingly desperate for the truth no matter how horrific that truth might be. One must have a cold heart not to find sympathy with her, and even the most hardened audience member will find it hard not to feel that stray tear form in the corner of their trembling eye when all is revealed. "The Orphanage" offers nothing terribly new, but sometimes the same old ghost story presented in a beautiful way makes for the best type of cold-rainy-day entertainment.

Let me begin by saying I DON'T like horror movies. I don't enjoy jumping in my seat. I don't like being afraid of the dark for the next 2 days, and I usually HATE Spanish movies. So usually I only see the big horror classics, and that is because I've read enough spoilers to confront the movie in a laid-back way.Having said this, I was dragged to see this movie against my will. And I was right! I have never, EVER, been more uneasy, uncomfortable on any movie, from the Exorcist to the Prophecy, from Psycho to Halloween. The story seems obvious; the cliché-horror themes are there, and while I saw them coming, I was comfortable enough. But then comes the movie, the script, the score, the acting, all in perfect harmony... and you jump, and you chill and you shout and you wish you had never entered that dammed cinema.It is good. It is great.It is moving and horrifying. It does not need CGI, sound effects or unreal characters. Its there. Its real. Its haunting. It WILL be a classic.Chapeau!

I saw this at the Frightfest and its AMAZING, did the previous reviewer even see it? No real shocks!!, I've never seen a cinema jump like the audience at Frightfest for this film. I'm kind of tempted to name the shocks but I wont. Its such a stunningly made film, creepy, atmospheric, shocking, great story, beautifully directed, the main woman is incredible. I was never really sure if it was supernatural or psychological, but as it reveals...wow, its excellent. Its so well done I cant write more without giving stuff away, but go and see it. I was expecting a low rent " pan's Labyrinth " but I think it might be even better than PL, though very different. Best film i've seen in ages

If you love a well-told ghost story, then you should enjoy THE ORPHANAGE. It's packed with mystery, dread, and perfectly-placed chills.Laura (Belen Rueda) returns to the titular institution of her youth in order to turn it into a home for disabled children. With her husband and young son in tow, all seems fine at first. When tragedy strikes, Laura's world collapses, leaving her at the mercy of a supernatural game.This movie deals as much with the agony of loss as it does with the paranormal. The ending is as poignant as it is terrifying. Recommended for those seeking intelligent horror films...

Attended the first commercial screening of The Orphanage (El Orfanato) last night at FrightFest, London. Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez have delivered something really special for their first feature. I have never jumped out of my seat like I did last night, nor my partner, nor most of the audience it seemed. Apart from the terrific scares, there are solid performances from the whole cast, stunning cinematography, and the editing is flawless. If I had to criticise one element, it is that the music swells just a little too much a couple of times, but it is a good score nonetheless.See this one at the cinema.

I went to see this film not expecting too much and was therefore unmoved by the end credits. This is a film in the horror category that plays on atmosphere, camera style and storyline rather than sheer gore. To that end it's a decent enough effort. Yes it does deliver a hefty chunk of chilling atmosphere and the film is heavily influenced by such films as The Others, The Haunting and even The Grudge. The acting is fine too but I found many of the scenes overlong and predictable. Apart from two moments which will jolt you out of your seat, there is a distinct lack of scariness here simply because the key scenes are not convincing enough and there is a distinct lack of creepiness, director Bayona obviously preferring tension and pseudo-suspense - the latter of which is misplaced in a number of scenes. I can understand perfectly some people being drawn convincingly into the story by simple virtue of it's claustrophobic feel and the way it's all played out, but that is not enough to save it from being at times laborious. Instead of it being one of Spain's best it simply creates a level to which others might aspire to do better. A good effort but nonetheless disappointing.

Laura returns with her family to the orphanage she grew up in as a child, she reopens it for handicapped children and all is going to plan until her son starts communicating with an invisible friend...Directed by Juan Antonio Bayona & produced by Guillermo del Toro, this Spanish picture is a delightful antidote to the ream of gore for gore sake movies flooding the market on a seemingly daily basis. This is not a horror movie as such, this is one of those pictures that oozes old fashioned values as regards telling a grand old ghost story with mysterious undertones. The setting is perfect, the orphanage of the piece is a ghostly monolithic structure that has all those perfectly shadowy rooms that are hiding secrets, expansive gardens perfectly framed in aura by Bayona's willingness to let the setting be an integral part of the story. The story is a creepy one, and there is always an added air of unease when children are the focal point of the piece in question, and sure enough this central concept of troubled children and troubled childhoods gets the maximum amount of emotion from the viewing public.It's hard to write anymore than I have without delving deeper into the story and it's significant turn of events, suffice to say I feel this is a wonderful creepy, and at times beautiful, film that prospective viewers would be better off going into devoid of any prior knowledge. Belén Rueda plays Laura and it's a marvellous performance from her, full of emotion and guts, she carries the film with skillful ease. Bayona directs carefully, and it's evident that he is benefiting from the guiding hands of his gifted producer, but his marker is here and I'll be keeping an eye out for future efforts from the young Spaniard.A smashingly engaging film that is in the vein of Robert Wise's The Haunting & Alejandro Amenábar's The Others, so if you like real well told ghost stories that unhinge rather than shock you, get in the queue because El Orfanato is a real pleasure. 9/10

It's a unique experience to watch Spanish horror compared to American, but I personally enjoyed this film. The ending fits the buildup, and the scary scenes are definitely unsettling. It doesn't take anything to the next level like the best horror out there, but you'll get scared a few times throughout your viewing experience.Worth a watch if you are getting bored of the same, violent, predictable horror out there.

This is an incredible movie - period!The fact that its a horror movie will no doubt divide the fans of the genre. Will there be blood? No. Is it unrated or too scary for cinemas? No. Will it give you nightmares? Hardly. But what it will give you is brilliant acting and a story so perfectly executed - IN A HORROR MOVIE MIND YOU.I've watched hundreds of horror movies and most of them will have something - something they obviously wanted to build the movie around - wheter it be brutality, jumpscares, creepy mutants or loads of guts and blood being shovelled in your face, but hardly any of them focus on the story. This one does - much like "The Others" did a handful of years before it.If you decide to watch The Orfanage, you can lean back comfortably in your seat (although you will probably stay clued to the edge) and have faith that it will take you from beginning to end in a carefully considered way... with no special effects, no bewildered zombies or other inexplicable things being mindlessly tossed in for dramatic effect and best of all - no unanswered questions.Enjoy! (PS the Wendy reference knocked the air right out of me)

I went into a screening of this today knowing only that it was about a woman who buys the home she lived in as an orphaned child, planning to open it to other orphans, that it mixed fantasy and reality, and that Guillermo del Toro of 'Pan's Labyrinth' had a hand in it. I didn't have any expectations. Even if I did, I certainly not have expected what I got. 'El Orfanato' surprised me first in successfully thrilling me with its surface, and surprised me again in how deeply it moved me with its core.When Laura (the marvelous Belén Rueda) moves back into the house that used to be the orphanage she lived in as a girl, she is thirty-seven, married, and she and her husband have adopted a son - Simón, a little boy with HIV who doesn't know that he's terminally ill or adopted. Simón is wildly creative - he has several imaginary friends and a penchant for treasure hunts, mind games, and the story of Peter Pan. One day shortly after a mysterious visit from a social worker and Simón's revelation that he knows the truth about his adoption and illness, Simón disappears. The rest of the film follows Laura's desperate search for her son as she comes to terms with her loss and her own past as well.Screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez does a masterful job of balancing the thriller with the drama. Laura's attempts to connect with everything that haunts her and her home are darkly touching, though slightly psychologically twisted. The acting is strong, and the directing, editing, cinematography, and music all work together well. Some of the sound effects - the constant creaking, wind blowing, etc. - got wearisome as the film went on, and some of the thrills were a little cheap - I won't ruin it for anyone by revealing them - though, admittedly, they were effective all the same. The story dragged a little towards the end and during the scene with the medium - cutting it just a little shorter might have been equally as effective and easier on the viewer.Bottom line: even if you don't like "scary" movies (like me), you'll probably still appreciate and enjoy the more thrilling aspects. If you're a horror flick buff, you'll probably find some of the thriller elements a little tired and overdone. Either way, it's still worth seeing - the exploration of Laura's heart and mind are both lovely and tragic to behold, and though the film is morbid, it is beautiful as well.

I'm a little bit tired of horror and suspense films. I had to get to the cinema because I could not say no to my girlfriend. Now I do not regret the wonderful evening I spent. This film achieved what others did not- I could not release my girlfriend's hand all over the time, and when the story finished I discovered there was nothing unexplained. A great suspense film I recommend. Belén Rueda, is a completely credible character and the place where the story has been shot helps make it realistic or, at least, the viewer gets into the environment created. The rest of actors are good and Geraldine Chaplin's scene is one of the most creepy I've ever seen

I went into this movie expecting the usual horror slock but was taken complely by surprise. This is a well made, well written and well executed movie with only small inperfections.The charecters just have so much charm, you root for them and are heartbroken whenever they are hurt.The movie follows Laura and her family that buys the old orphanage she used to be in. The place is giving of some scary vibes and soon her son Simòn disappears.This movie is emotionally brutal. It sets up these charming and lovable charecters and sees them slowly decent into sadness whenever something bad happens. The ending of this film made me tear up and is a gut punch in all the right ways.One of the small problems I have with the movie is how it balances it's different elements. The movie is a Charming ghost story, then paranormal investigation then straight up horror movie and tragic drama. While all these elements work on their own, they can feel disconnected from the part before it, as if you were watching a completely new movie. I don't see this as a major flaw but something I noticed while watching.The story is an amazing exploration of desperation. The little family that loses it's son, starts to believe in ghost and will do anything to see him again. Seeing them rationalice more and more wierd and unbelievable stuff is heartbreaking. Even now I wonder if their ever really were ghosts or if Laura just wanted to believe so bad in order to find her son. Both stories are amazing interpretations in my opinion.This movies scares are great. I am sadly so used to American cueing now that it surprised me whenever the movie didn't do a cheap jumpscare. All the scares are earned and well done, with only a few not doing it for me. The atmosphere is what is making the movie scary, not loud noises. There is one scene towards the end that freaked me out with so much tension that you'll be bursting with antisepation inside.The camera work is also really well done in this film with great moving cameras and beutiful stills. The camera work doing scary scenes are especially done well and Really makes the scenes even scarier.I highly recommend this film. After a long dry period with bad horror movies it's great to finally see an amazing one. It is a most see.

Greetings again from the darkness. We are blessed with so few horror movies for grown-ups because it is a nearly impossible genre to succeed in. There is such a fine line between suspense and stupidity, and to succeed there must be an air of believability. This film manages to walk the high wire and maintain the balance ... to the point of a few good scares and more than enough suspense! Produced by the great Guillermo del Toro and directed by Spain's new hot shot director, Juan Antonio Bayona, the film has some very basic, even cliché, story lines and premises. Still the quality is so high and the acting so strong that it does suck the viewer right into this world. The simplistic approach is what makes it work. The house creaks, clanks and other noises are extraordinarily creepy and not over the top. The best moments are the "little" things and I really enjoyed Geraldine Chaplin's time as the medium.OK, it is a horror movie, but this is a very good performance from Bolen Rueda, who was so memorable in "The Sea Inside". Ms. Rueda is Laura, who wants to set up a house for a few needy kids in the same house in which she lived as an orphan when she was a kid. Guess what? There is more to the story than that! Laura's own adopted son is played by the extraordinarily cute Roger Princep as Simon. Big eyes and bushy hair, he is like a living (or maybe not) doll.It is so difficult for these films to find an audience, especially when released in the U.S. with sub-titles, but this one deserves attention to anyone who enjoys a little suspense and a few good darkened theatre jumps in the seat!

As scripted by Sergio G. Sanchez and directed by J.A. Bayona, "El Orfanato" a.k.a. "The Orphanage" is a haunting, beautiful, and poetic horror tale. It derives its impact from being so utterly rich in emotion and for drenching it in genuine atmosphere rather going for the purely visceral impact - or relying too heavily on the jump scare. The performances, the writing, and the directing are very sensitive and you can completely get on the side of the lead character. And you're discovering things with her rather than being one step ahead the entire time. This is one film that could very well be described as a journey. And when it's all over, it will definitely stay with you.Gorgeous Belen Rueda stars as Laura, a young woman who lives with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) in what used to be the orphanage where she dwelled as a child. They seem to have a happy life with adopted son Simon (adorable Roger Princep), but haven't actually told the truth to the kid, either that he's sick (he's HIV positive) or that they're his adoptive parents and not his biological ones. She's concerned because of his association with imaginary friends, but things take an even darker one when the boy disappears from a costume party. It's up to Laura to find Simon and to probe the mysteries of this orphanage.Enhanced by a lovely score by Fernando Velazquez, "El Orfanato" is deliberately paced but rewarding for patient viewers. It entirely hinges on the acting and the mood and in fact doesn't feature that much in the way of visual effects. There is a real sense of sadness throughout, and despair, and one can completely sympathize with Laura and Simon. The film is reasonably spooky, especially when paranormal experts and a medium (played by guest star Geraldine Chaplin) try to get in contact with the restless spirits of the piece; instead of making us see with our eyes what she is describing, it forces us to use our imagination. The final act is all about Laura as she isolates herself and attempts to recreate the past in order to unlock its secrets.Ultimately a satisfying experience, "El Orfanato" would come highly recommended to those genre fans wishing for films more in the mold of "The Haunting" (1963) and "The Others".Eight out of 10.

This movie has already been compared to way too many classic and well-known contemporary horror films. That's because it's a classic story. A woman moves into the haunted house of her memories, discovers ghosts and a mystery, starts working it all out while a cynical husband states that it can't be real, and eventually resolves the pained past of what causes the haunting in the first place, thus leading to transcendence. There are creepy children, bumps in the night, and an old woman with shady motivations. It literally couldn't go wrong.And it doesn't. J.A. Bayona gets the help of famed Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro to float, move, and explore his way through dusty rooms, hidden basements, and creepy hallways. Belen Rueda plays a caring, compassionate mother who only wants to protect her son, though she makes mistakes that sometimes a mother makes. Creepy ghost children play hide-and-seek and treasure-hunt games, ultimately leading to a compelling twist. This movie is carefully designed and even holds a few surprises.Whereas it may not be the most original movie out there, it certainly has its place for an audience craving a good old fashioned horror movie themed around something other than idiots trapped in a room full of intricate torture devices. It's a very nice return to form, and it's probably something you should see before the grubby Hollywood execs put their dirty paws on it and turn it into a CUTITSACAT! glurge-o-mania.--PolarisDiB

The former orphan Laura (Belén Rueda) raises her adopted son Simón (Roger Príncep) with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) in an old house and former orphanage where she was raised. Simón is HIV positive and tells Laura that he has five invisible friends, and she believes they are fruit of his imagination. Laura decides to reopen an orphanage for handicapped children in the location and during the opening party, Simón calls her to show the little cabin of his friend Tomás. The busy Laura does not gives much attention to her son; then she sees a mysterious masked boy and Simón vanishes. Laura feels the presence of other persons in the house and months later, the desperate Laura invites a team of parapsychologists to try to unravel the mystery."El Orfanato" is a creepy and spooky ghost story with a dark and very sad atmosphere. The screenplay, direction, acting and cinematography are great, disclosing a dramatic and sensitive plot that explores the disappearance of a young boy with touches of supernatural in the despair of his mother. However, the explanation of the mystery in the end makes this sensitive movie actually a drama, and not horror genre, and maybe that is the reason why some viewers have written bad reviews (or maybe they have not understood the plot). My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Orfanato" ("The Orphanage")Note: On 25 January 2015 I saw this movie again on Blu-Ray.

The Orphanage concerns a former resident who ultimately is adopted and returns to the abandoned institution as an adult to open a home for disabled children. Prior to the opening, her son, who is also adopted, disappears. Most of the plot involves the mystery of what happened to her child and her friends at the orphanage. I have to say that for most of this movie I was bored out of my mind due to the slow pace. The concept itself was okay and the story is all tied up in a tidy bundle by the end, but getting there was quite tedious at times.The acting was okay, but bordered on the melodramatic in certain parts. However, the mom's desperation and frustration over the loss of her son is appropriate. I think the characters did okay overall with the lines they had been given considering the slow pace. I just wish the film would have had more oomph. Some of the sets and cinematography were quite nice and interesting as well and the orphanage itself has quite the creepy feel to it. The film has a fair amount of atmosphere.IMHO, this film had the horror equivalent of Crimson Peak, a movie that I actually did like. The horror element in The Orphanage is quite tame, so if you are looking for thrills and chills, I don't know that this film will do it for you. I don't know that it will do for a hardened horror fan either. Mystery, suspense and drama fans might like it if they don't mind the supernatural elements and the snail's pace.

The Orphanage is a slick and quietly chilling piece of work based around (what else?) an orphanage. A woman named Laura returns to the orphanage she grew up in as a child, with the intention of opening it up again as a home for children with disabilities. Together with her husband and adopted son Simon, Laura tries to make the huge old building ready to receive it's first new residents, but all is not quiet in the dusty rooms and grounds, and gradually she starts to feel sinister presences from the past making themselves known.The film strings out quite a good story, blending traditional scares (bumping noises heard through walls and doors, silently appearing children in masks) with modern touches (Simon is HIV positive). Although most of the actual frights are on the soft side, the film does have quite away with sudden shocks, especially one great sequence involving the death of a sinister secondary character...you'll know when you see it! But mostly, things stay pretty calm, and there were times when I was wishing for something more visceral to actually happen, as many of the very well built tension sequences fade away without any cinematic pay-off, such as a very tense séance sequence, and in most of the (many) scenes of Laura alone in the orphanage, she being almost too subtly menaced for things to get really scary, which I think is a shame. However there are certain moments when you WILL jump!However, The Orphanage still stands up as a strong piece of work. The backbone of the film is undoubtedly the strong performance by Belén Rueda as Laura, who carries the entire film admirably. The film looks great, with stunning photography and very elegant sets and a gorgeous building standing in for the orphanage itself. Sound and music work very well too, and the film succeeds in working many small elements together (such as a playground hiding game and some very clever revelations towards the end), so all in all, the film is an accomplished piece of cinema and well worth seeing, although don't expect too much real terror as most of the chills in this film are poetic rather than gruesome.

Laura (Belen Rueda) returns to the orphanage she spent time in as a child with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and little boy Simon (Roger Princep) in hopes of re-establishing it as seaside retreat for children with disabilities only to find there may be some former residents who never left. In Juan Antonio Bayona's tightly wound "The Orphanage" nothing is as it seems and child's play takes on sinister overtones.Bayona belongs to this new wave of Spanish-language directors (most notably Del Torro and Amenabar) who excel when it comes to creating moody atmospheric tales of the supernatural with Catholic overtones.

Be warned, "The Orphanage" is often more sad than scary, and those not familiar with Catholic mysticism might find things a bit hard to believe. As goes the film's mantra...Believe, Then You Will See. Those with the patience and the heart will be greatly rewarded as the audience doesn't necessarily have to Believe to relate to the characters who do.Working from refined "less is more" psychological horror templates, Bayona delivers the formulaic goods. There will be a simplistic but heartfelt exploration of grief. There will be allusions to classic literature (in this case a very nicely done "Peter Pan" as Catholic allegory motif). There will be uncovering dark secrets from the past. There will be precocious children with spooky imaginary friends. There will be creaking set designs and manipulative sound effects to create "gotcha!" moments. There will be a creepy medium (an excellent Geraldine Chaplin) brought in for a séance.

"The Orphanage" offers nothing terribly new, but sometimes the same old ghost story presented in a beautiful way makes for the best type of cold-rainy-day entertainment.

This film is less like a traditional horror movie and more of a drama/mystery with strong supernatural elements. The setup is that Laura, who once lived at an orphanage, returns to the orphanage with her husband and son to start it up again as a place for special needs children. Of course, it all seems simple, but there are mysteries abound in this story and the revelations trickle in over the course of the tale.The film isn't particularly frightening, although it has a couple of jumpy moments. Rather than focusing on creating an atmosphere of fear, instead it works on drawing up sympathy for Laura's plight as events transpire against her and her family and the past comes back to haunt her. It's an interesting meditation on loss as well that had a wonderful potential to straddle the line between real-world and supernatural (but don't worry folks, it doesn't--it's firmly supernatural and you know it from early on). Nonetheless, that you could imagine this film working even if the supernatural elements were just in Laura's mind and that's a pretty good thing for the drama.The technical aspects of the film are all sound (although I noticed a couple of background gaffs, but I think you'd have to look for them), with clear direction, capable lensing and design. The actors all do a good job of rendering their characters (children fare believably enough) and Belen Rueda carries the film well as the central protagonist. The story itself doesn't reach any great depths, but unraveling the mystery with the film is enjoyable.It's nothing stunning, but in the world of horror films, it easily stands a shoulder above the regular flotsam that the genre tends to churn out. At that, it's no terrible film and could be recommended if you're looking for a relatively intelligent and well composed supernatural horror-type film. Just don't expect bloodbaths and constant shocks. 7/10.

This movie was OK, but that's about it. For me, it joins the large list of suspenseful, but forgettable films.The characters were underdeveloped and unlikeable.This film is very overrated, not particularly moving but suspenseful at times. The story has been done slightly differently but many times before.What is the big fuss about?If this film was American it would have been brushed aside and not have been given the inflated amount of attention it has been. Yeah, hated Pan's Labyrinth too.

The movie just seems fine to me.I think everything that appears on it has been done before, and in a better way. It's kinda Poltergeist being remade, with some forced Peter Pan and fairy tale touch. The story is quite predictable and dull, but at least has a strong performance on Belén Rueda.One of the issues that pushes me off the movie is that: the kid never actually asks for help. He beats the door because he's been locked in the basement, but never says nothing. No cries, no yells. Only beats, because that's convenient for the story.

This is an incredible movie - period!The fact that its a horror movie will no doubt divide the fans of the genre. Will there be blood? No. Is it unrated or too scary for cinemas? No. Will it give you nightmares? Hardly. But what it will give you is brilliant acting and a story so perfectly executed - IN A HORROR MOVIE MIND YOU.I've watched hundreds of horror movies and most of them will have something - something they obviously wanted to build the movie around - wheter it be brutality, jumpscares, creepy mutants or loads of guts and blood being shovelled in your face, but hardly any of them focus on the story. This one does - much like "The Others" did a handful of years before it.If you decide to watch The Orfanage, you can lean back comfortably in your seat (although you will probably stay clued to the edge) and have faith that it will take you from beginning to end in a carefully considered way... with no special effects, no bewildered zombies or other inexplicable things being mindlessly tossed in for dramatic effect and best of all - no unanswered questions.Enjoy! (PS the Wendy reference knocked the air right out of me)

It's a unique experience to watch Spanish horror compared to American, but I personally enjoyed this film. The ending fits the buildup, and the scary scenes are definitely unsettling. It doesn't take anything to the next level like the best horror out there, but you'll get scared a few times throughout your viewing experience.Worth a watch if you are getting bored of the same, violent, predictable horror out there.

I pretty much knew with relative certainty and from beforehand that "The Orphanage" wasn't going to be my cup of tea. Slow-brooding ghost stories almost never appeal to me and I didn't even care for producer Guillermo Del Toro's own and critically acclaimed "The Devil's Backbone". But, considering the hugely positive internet buzz as well as the endless amount of praising reviews on this website, I - being a devoted horror fanatic - simply couldn't afford to ignore this Spanish instant classic entirely. Well, the only thing I can conclude after seeing the film is that "The Orphanage" is exactly what you expect from a relatively soft, mainstream and overall ethically correct modern day horror production; whether it's made in Spain, Japan or elsewhere in the world. Obviously it's an extremely professionally made film, with a handful of memorable style elements and effective jump moments, but in the end it really isn't much more than just another derivative and predictable 'ghosts from the past coming back to haunt us' tale that lack the courage to go very far. Undoubtedly the qualitatively greatest aspect about "The Orphanage" is the naturally sinister setting. The events take place in an old and remote orphanage - duh - located near a quiet beach with an inactive lighthouse and a wide network of sinister caves. Laura, who spend her childhood here, returns with her husband and 7-year-old son and intends to re-open the orphanage specifically for orphans with a mental and/or physical handicap. On the day of the opening, however, Laura's own son Simon - who's also adopted and chronically ill - mysteriously disappears without a trace. Months go by without a sign of life and Laura understandably starts to get desperate. Was Simon kidnapped by the uncanny lady who arrived at the orphanage and posed as a social assistant shortly before his disappearance? Or perhaps Laura should have listened more to her son's stories about the invisible friends he made, as they seem to know an awful lot of accurate details about the orphanage's dark past. Somewhat to my anticipated frustration, "The Orphanage" contains all the clichés and stereotypes the sub genre of ghost stories has to offer. There's the overly fanatic mother versus the rational father, the eccentric and somewhat flamboyant spiritual medium, the morbid old lady that may or may not be real and of course a wide collection of pity-evoking long dead children whose souls are restless. The young and relatively inexperienced director J.A. Bayona does an impressive job maintaining the macabre ambiance all the way from start to finish, but sadly it isn't enough to qualify as a masterpiece in the genre. There's only just ONE that really made me jump towards the edge for my seat for a little while, namely the second confrontation with the elderly lady in the middle of a busy street. Although this is unquestionably a truly masterful sequence, it's nearly not enough as far as I'm concerned. Many fans glorify the finale, but the whole third act actually just confirmed to me that "The Orphanage" rather wanted to be a sentimental melodrama about the true values of family and motherly love. When it comes to (Spanish) ghost stories of the past 10 to 20 years, Amenábar's unique and already classic "The Others" is still the norm and "The Orphanage" is not likely to change that.

I went into a screening of this today knowing only that it was about a woman who buys the home she lived in as an orphaned child, planning to open it to other orphans, that it mixed fantasy and reality, and that Guillermo del Toro of 'Pan's Labyrinth' had a hand in it. I didn't have any expectations. Even if I did, I certainly not have expected what I got. 'El Orfanato' surprised me first in successfully thrilling me with its surface, and surprised me again in how deeply it moved me with its core.When Laura (the marvelous Belén Rueda) moves back into the house that used to be the orphanage she lived in as a girl, she is thirty-seven, married, and she and her husband have adopted a son - Simón, a little boy with HIV who doesn't know that he's terminally ill or adopted. Simón is wildly creative - he has several imaginary friends and a penchant for treasure hunts, mind games, and the story of Peter Pan. One day shortly after a mysterious visit from a social worker and Simón's revelation that he knows the truth about his adoption and illness, Simón disappears. The rest of the film follows Laura's desperate search for her son as she comes to terms with her loss and her own past as well.Screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez does a masterful job of balancing the thriller with the drama. Laura's attempts to connect with everything that haunts her and her home are darkly touching, though slightly psychologically twisted. The acting is strong, and the directing, editing, cinematography, and music all work together well. Some of the sound effects - the constant creaking, wind blowing, etc. - got wearisome as the film went on, and some of the thrills were a little cheap - I won't ruin it for anyone by revealing them - though, admittedly, they were effective all the same. The story dragged a little towards the end and during the scene with the medium - cutting it just a little shorter might have been equally as effective and easier on the viewer.Bottom line: even if you don't like "scary" movies (like me), you'll probably still appreciate and enjoy the more thrilling aspects. If you're a horror flick buff, you'll probably find some of the thriller elements a little tired and overdone. Either way, it's still worth seeing - the exploration of Laura's heart and mind are both lovely and tragic to behold, and though the film is morbid, it is beautiful as well.

I'm a little bit tired of horror and suspense films. I had to get to the cinema because I could not say no to my girlfriend. Now I do not regret the wonderful evening I spent. This film achieved what others did not- I could not release my girlfriend's hand all over the time, and when the story finished I discovered there was nothing unexplained. A great suspense film I recommend. Belén Rueda, is a completely credible character and the place where the story has been shot helps make it realistic or, at least, the viewer gets into the environment created. The rest of actors are good and Geraldine Chaplin's scene is one of the most creepy I've ever seen

There is something to the marketing of foreign films and the way Hollywood tries its hardest to fool the public into thinking it is an English language movie. By not allowing any characters to speak in the trailers, giving away their secret with subtitles, someone like me, knowing it's foreign, is able to get a glimpse at the style and tone without really learning anything about the plot to ruin my surprise upon sitting in the theatre. This aspect worked perfectly for Guillermo Del Toro's production of El Orfanato. I had very little idea of what I was getting into and this film ended up being the best atmospheric horror I have seen since Alejandro Amenábar's The Others, (I don't count Del Toro's own El Laberinto del fauno because that was more fantasy than anything else). I now ask what it is that all three of these films have in common? With thisJ.A. Bayona's feature debuteach is helmed by a Spanish director. I can't think of a better nation making movies right now; the Spanish are doing everything right and this film just adds to bolstering that argument.Bayona creates a mood and tone that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats, anticipating the scares that they know will shortly be coming. I was actually surprised how slow the introduction was and how carefully laid out all the story pieces were. We are led into this world, discovering the relationships between our lead roles and the vague past of the orphanage that once housed our heroine and now is about to become her home for special needs children. Like The Others, the spirits involved here are not necessarily violent or demonic. They have an agenda, for sure, but what may at first glance seem malevolent could be nothing of the kind. The orphans now haunting the establishment are only trying to play a game. By taking something you love, a scavenger hunt is begun. Following the clues is the only way the game can end and if successful, the children will grant you one wish. The rules are simple, except the circumstances are far from easily accessible. One must believe that the game can happen before he/she can truly take part. Without the belief that the spirits are in control, success can never be achieved.The cast is led by a remarkable performance from Belén Ruedawho, as it turns out, had a wonderful turn in Amenábar's latest Mar adentro. Her composure and beauty is shattered as she finds her son has been lost. Trying to keep herself together, taking in what the police, her husband, and the mediums enlisted to help on the paranormal aspect tell her, she is given the task to figure out for herself how far she is willing to go to find her son. Always captivating and never out of her element, Rueda carries the story and never looks back. The supporting players around her are all portrayed nicely as well. Fernando Cayo plays the husband watching his wife deteriorate before him while unable to open his mind to the possibility that what she says could be true; Geraldine Chaplin is magnificent as the psychic medium whose trance brings out a puzzle piece necessary to continue the game; and young Roger Príncep plays the child Simón with the right amount of innocence mixed with the knowledge and comprehension of his fate to help keep the bond between he and his mother strong.Bayona never goes for the cheap thrills either as he builds up the tension with sounds and visuals. His use of the closing doors and the moving merry-go-round add a sense of foreboding that ends up being more important than you may initially guess. Stylistically too, the transition between the house's current state of duress with the way it shone by the glow of the adjacent lighthouse from the past is expertly handled. There were numerous instances where the film could have gone off the rails to tragic effect, but he holds it steady throughout. More psychological than visceral, the scares are few, but effective. Even when the grotesque rears its head, it is to enhance the story, not to shock for shock alone. The sound work is utilized to the fullest too. What seems to be jarring and loud for the purpose to scare our lead and us is actually very important to the tale at hand. Nothing is shown or heard here that doesn't have absolute relevance to the film as a whole.The final third of the film comes quick and fully envelopes you into the proceedings. You are right there with Rueda's character as she slowly uncovers the secrets hidden behind the years that have past since she last lived in the orphanage. Whereas a film from Hollywoodof late usually being a remake from a better horror film in Japanwould use this tension in order to hide the flimsy and lackluster conclusion it tacks on so as not to alienate those viewers who enjoy leaving the theatre with a smile, Bayona knows how to effectively end his tale the way it should. I was blown away by the handling of the final scene and the way he used the rules of the game to transition us from one reality to another. It is truly a remarkable feat that hits home hard emotionally, but I will actually say also succeeded in me leaving with a smile on my face. Whether you exit the theatre with your eyes moistened or not, you will not forget the beauty and perfection for which it concludes. The tagline is correct, for while it is a story of horror, it is above all else a tale of love.

Let me first say that this movie had some great scenes, and the creepy atmosphere was very well done.Now lets talk about what I didn't like...This whole movie was all about suspense. Lots of bumps and loud noises in the dark accompanied with suspenseful music. Most of these sequences lead up to absolutely nothing, which really takes away from the purpose of the suspense. I didn't care for any of the characters and there were only a few bits of interesting dialogue. Generally speaking this movie didn't have a whole lot of original material. The whole concept of the little kid having imaginary friends in a haunted house has been done in so many different movies I felt like I had already seen most of what this movie had to offer.

I went into this movie expecting the usual horror slock but was taken complely by surprise. This is a well made, well written and well executed movie with only small inperfections.The charecters just have so much charm, you root for them and are heartbroken whenever they are hurt.The movie follows Laura and her family that buys the old orphanage she used to be in. The place is giving of some scary vibes and soon her son Simòn disappears.This movie is emotionally brutal. It sets up these charming and lovable charecters and sees them slowly decent into sadness whenever something bad happens. The ending of this film made me tear up and is a gut punch in all the right ways.One of the small problems I have with the movie is how it balances it's different elements. The movie is a Charming ghost story, then paranormal investigation then straight up horror movie and tragic drama. While all these elements work on their own, they can feel disconnected from the part before it, as if you were watching a completely new movie. I don't see this as a major flaw but something I noticed while watching.The story is an amazing exploration of desperation. The little family that loses it's son, starts to believe in ghost and will do anything to see him again. Seeing them rationalice more and more wierd and unbelievable stuff is heartbreaking. Even now I wonder if their ever really were ghosts or if Laura just wanted to believe so bad in order to find her son. Both stories are amazing interpretations in my opinion.This movies scares are great. I am sadly so used to American cueing now that it surprised me whenever the movie didn't do a cheap jumpscare. All the scares are earned and well done, with only a few not doing it for me. The atmosphere is what is making the movie scary, not loud noises. There is one scene towards the end that freaked me out with so much tension that you'll be bursting with antisepation inside.The camera work is also really well done in this film with great moving cameras and beutiful stills. The camera work doing scary scenes are especially done well and Really makes the scenes even scarier.I highly recommend this film. After a long dry period with bad horror movies it's great to finally see an amazing one. It is a most see.

Greetings again from the darkness. We are blessed with so few horror movies for grown-ups because it is a nearly impossible genre to succeed in. There is such a fine line between suspense and stupidity, and to succeed there must be an air of believability. This film manages to walk the high wire and maintain the balance ... to the point of a few good scares and more than enough suspense! Produced by the great Guillermo del Toro and directed by Spain's new hot shot director, Juan Antonio Bayona, the film has some very basic, even cliché, story lines and premises. Still the quality is so high and the acting so strong that it does suck the viewer right into this world. The simplistic approach is what makes it work. The house creaks, clanks and other noises are extraordinarily creepy and not over the top. The best moments are the "little" things and I really enjoyed Geraldine Chaplin's time as the medium.OK, it is a horror movie, but this is a very good performance from Bolen Rueda, who was so memorable in "The Sea Inside". Ms. Rueda is Laura, who wants to set up a house for a few needy kids in the same house in which she lived as an orphan when she was a kid. Guess what? There is more to the story than that! Laura's own adopted son is played by the extraordinarily cute Roger Princep as Simon. Big eyes and bushy hair, he is like a living (or maybe not) doll.It is so difficult for these films to find an audience, especially when released in the U.S. with sub-titles, but this one deserves attention to anyone who enjoys a little suspense and a few good darkened theatre jumps in the seat!

As scripted by Sergio G. Sanchez and directed by J.A. Bayona, "El Orfanato" a.k.a. "The Orphanage" is a haunting, beautiful, and poetic horror tale. It derives its impact from being so utterly rich in emotion and for drenching it in genuine atmosphere rather going for the purely visceral impact - or relying too heavily on the jump scare. The performances, the writing, and the directing are very sensitive and you can completely get on the side of the lead character. And you're discovering things with her rather than being one step ahead the entire time. This is one film that could very well be described as a journey. And when it's all over, it will definitely stay with you.Gorgeous Belen Rueda stars as Laura, a young woman who lives with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) in what used to be the orphanage where she dwelled as a child. They seem to have a happy life with adopted son Simon (adorable Roger Princep), but haven't actually told the truth to the kid, either that he's sick (he's HIV positive) or that they're his adoptive parents and not his biological ones. She's concerned because of his association with imaginary friends, but things take an even darker one when the boy disappears from a costume party. It's up to Laura to find Simon and to probe the mysteries of this orphanage.Enhanced by a lovely score by Fernando Velazquez, "El Orfanato" is deliberately paced but rewarding for patient viewers. It entirely hinges on the acting and the mood and in fact doesn't feature that much in the way of visual effects. There is a real sense of sadness throughout, and despair, and one can completely sympathize with Laura and Simon. The film is reasonably spooky, especially when paranormal experts and a medium (played by guest star Geraldine Chaplin) try to get in contact with the restless spirits of the piece; instead of making us see with our eyes what she is describing, it forces us to use our imagination. The final act is all about Laura as she isolates herself and attempts to recreate the past in order to unlock its secrets.Ultimately a satisfying experience, "El Orfanato" would come highly recommended to those genre fans wishing for films more in the mold of "The Haunting" (1963) and "The Others".Eight out of 10.

This movie has already been compared to way too many classic and well-known contemporary horror films. That's because it's a classic story. A woman moves into the haunted house of her memories, discovers ghosts and a mystery, starts working it all out while a cynical husband states that it can't be real, and eventually resolves the pained past of what causes the haunting in the first place, thus leading to transcendence. There are creepy children, bumps in the night, and an old woman with shady motivations. It literally couldn't go wrong.And it doesn't. J.A. Bayona gets the help of famed Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro to float, move, and explore his way through dusty rooms, hidden basements, and creepy hallways. Belen Rueda plays a caring, compassionate mother who only wants to protect her son, though she makes mistakes that sometimes a mother makes. Creepy ghost children play hide-and-seek and treasure-hunt games, ultimately leading to a compelling twist. This movie is carefully designed and even holds a few surprises.Whereas it may not be the most original movie out there, it certainly has its place for an audience craving a good old fashioned horror movie themed around something other than idiots trapped in a room full of intricate torture devices. It's a very nice return to form, and it's probably something you should see before the grubby Hollywood execs put their dirty paws on it and turn it into a CUTITSACAT! glurge-o-mania.--PolarisDiB

The former orphan Laura (Belén Rueda) raises her adopted son Simón (Roger Príncep) with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) in an old house and former orphanage where she was raised. Simón is HIV positive and tells Laura that he has five invisible friends, and she believes they are fruit of his imagination. Laura decides to reopen an orphanage for handicapped children in the location and during the opening party, Simón calls her to show the little cabin of his friend Tomás. The busy Laura does not gives much attention to her son; then she sees a mysterious masked boy and Simón vanishes. Laura feels the presence of other persons in the house and months later, the desperate Laura invites a team of parapsychologists to try to unravel the mystery."El Orfanato" is a creepy and spooky ghost story with a dark and very sad atmosphere. The screenplay, direction, acting and cinematography are great, disclosing a dramatic and sensitive plot that explores the disappearance of a young boy with touches of supernatural in the despair of his mother. However, the explanation of the mystery in the end makes this sensitive movie actually a drama, and not horror genre, and maybe that is the reason why some viewers have written bad reviews (or maybe they have not understood the plot). My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Orfanato" ("The Orphanage")Note: On 25 January 2015 I saw this movie again on Blu-Ray.

This is one greatly directed and wonderful looking movie but I really wouldn't go as far to call this movie a great one as well.It's a movie that builds- and relies heavily on its atmosphere. And with its build-up and atmosphere this movie surely doesn't disappoint. It's a wonderful looking movie, with wonderful cinematography and use of light, to help build up the movie its tension, mystery and atmosphere. Credit for this of course also needs to go to director Juan Antonio Bayona, who did a great job with it all and provided the movie with some great moments.So what's the problem you might wonder. Well, unfortunately once you start analyzing it- and thinking back about it, the story just isn't really all that great or special. To be honest, it really isn't all that original and something I have seen done a lot before, in the recent past. Of course it's not like the story is bad all together but it's just that the movie didn't really offered anything new or surprising to me, no matter how creatively it all got told and shot at times.You also need to know what to expect when watching this movie. It's often being advertised as an horror but is it an horror really? I guess you could classify it as one, though supernatural thriller would perhaps be a better way to describe it. It has some scare moments in it and some other typical horror ingredients, as well as style but overall story-wise the movie has way more thriller, mystery and drama elements in it. This movie in fact definitely works better as a mystery than an horror really, so know what to expect when watching this movie.Producer's Guillermo del Toro touch is definitely notable throughout the movie. Like lots of other movies he was involved with, this one feels and can be seen as a dark fairytale, for adults. This is something I often really love about del Toro's movies and the one element that for me really stood out about it and made it still an original enough one, within its genre.I guess that those who aren't really into these sort of dark mystery thrillers, told in an horror style, will still end up really loving this movie and might end up being surprised by all of its twists and developments as well. For me personally it however was offering far too little new story-wise but I obviously still could really appreciate this movie, for the way it got made and looked.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

The Orphanage concerns a former resident who ultimately is adopted and returns to the abandoned institution as an adult to open a home for disabled children. Prior to the opening, her son, who is also adopted, disappears. Most of the plot involves the mystery of what happened to her child and her friends at the orphanage. I have to say that for most of this movie I was bored out of my mind due to the slow pace. The concept itself was okay and the story is all tied up in a tidy bundle by the end, but getting there was quite tedious at times.The acting was okay, but bordered on the melodramatic in certain parts. However, the mom's desperation and frustration over the loss of her son is appropriate. I think the characters did okay overall with the lines they had been given considering the slow pace. I just wish the film would have had more oomph. Some of the sets and cinematography were quite nice and interesting as well and the orphanage itself has quite the creepy feel to it. The film has a fair amount of atmosphere.IMHO, this film had the horror equivalent of Crimson Peak, a movie that I actually did like. The horror element in The Orphanage is quite tame, so if you are looking for thrills and chills, I don't know that this film will do it for you. I don't know that it will do for a hardened horror fan either. Mystery, suspense and drama fans might like it if they don't mind the supernatural elements and the snail's pace.
