I enjoyed this film, but I was left a little puzzled at the end by what I'd just watched in terms of what type of movie this is.It starts off as a very Tarantino-esquire film, it's clear that he wrote it as his famous dialogue is present. It's an enjoyable crime thriller much along the lines of Tarantino's other works (such as Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs) but with a bit of Robert Rodriguez flare shown during the action sequences.Then with about 50-ish minutes left, the style film changes entirely. It becomes another film, it goes from stylish crime thriller to random vampire action movie. It's almost as if Tarantino left the room while writing the script and somebody wrote the rest of the film for him, it loses it's Tarantino charm and becomes a predictable, gore fest, vampire flick.I'm a fan of Vampire films, so I still enjoyed the movie, but I can see why others don't like it. The acting is of high quality, especially from Geroge Clooney who outdoes himself, and in parts saves the film.8/10 - Watch with an open mind.

I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more "meta" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film.This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.

I have to say that this is actually a good movie although it does lose it's way towards the end. The final 15 minutes I thought were a little crappy. I prefer more realism in my vampires but having said that, I cannot fault Tarantino, his is perfect in the role as the twisted Richard Gecko, and although I don't usually like George Clooney he was surprisingly cool as Seth. There are some funny moments that you have to have a slightly twisted humour to appreciate (which I do!) and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is an entertaining movie. If you like overacting, lots and lots of blood and Tarantino movies then go see.

When the movie started, I was sold to a crime movie. The intro was the perfect setup for a Tarantino film. Two criminal brothers on the run trying to get to Mexico. Simple and brilliant.The movie introduced two hot-headed brothers, so you know crap was gonna hit the fan and duels were gonna go down. It had everything I wanted: black comedy, crime, suspense, drama, thriller, even Salma Hayek.At that point, everything was perfect... but then, the vampires appeared and the whole film had a 180 degree turn. It just didn't fit with the rest of the movie.I'm not gonna lie, the different ways of how they killed the vampires were pretty cool and creative, but I felt like the first half of the movie was made by Tarantino and the second half was made by Rodriguez.This movie had a lot of potential if it stuck with the first plot. I would've rated higher if they would've continued Gecko Brothers' adventure.

'From Dusk Till Dawn' is kind of brilliant, brutal, bloody, Tarantino, horror, silly and funny. It is brilliant, brutal, bloody, horror, silly and funny the way Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead'-series is all those things, the twist here is a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. This means the first hour is just brutal and bloody, sometimes a little funny, in the 'Pulp Fiction' kind of way.We see two brothers named Seth (George Clooney) and Richie Gecko (Quentin Tarantino). They are bank robbers, although they do the occasional killing as well. We learn they want to reach the Mexican border. That the entire state of Texas and the FBI are looking for them is a problem so they force the Fuller family to bring them across the border with their motor home. Father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) used to be a minister but gave up faith after his wife died in a car crash. He travels with his adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis).So we have the first hour, filled with Tarantino-stuff in its dialogue and references, and then the party arrives at a bar called the Titty Twister. Not long after they are inside it is revealed that every crew member from the bar is actually a vampire, feeding themselves on bikers and truckers that visit the place. The Fullers and Geckos survive together with a guy who calls himself Sex Machine (Tom Savini) and a guy named Frost (Fred Williamson). Now they are a team and face vampires as their opponents.You see how this movie is actually two movies. Especially the second part will find a smaller audience and in a way I was a little curious how the first part would have ended if they kept it as serious as it was. Still, because the movie shifts the way it does it becomes quite original. We have a crime movie to start and a horror comedy, really in the Sam Raimi way, to end. If you are able to take it the way it comes, not too serious, there is a good chance you might like it. Even the gore is presented in a silly way, making it less gory.Clooney's cool performance, the fitting soundtrack, some hilarious moments, Tarantino's fine touches all make this a highly original, quite bloody, vampire adventure. If you are a genre fan don't miss it, if you are not you might give it a try and be pleasantly surprised.

George Clooney should have stuck will this kind of role. He did fine in Out of Sight and Ocean's Eleven, but he really dominated this movie with a fury that we may never see again. Almost every line he delivers is memorable and that is not all Tarantino's doing. The rest of the cast is dominated by cool cameos and veteran cult and mainstream names. The exception being Ernest Liu who does a good job of holding his own. No Tarantino film would be complete without a good soundtrack. This one, as with Desperado, features songs by Tito and Tarantula. Although I have only heard four songs by them, I consider them one of my favorites. I will never forget what my parents told me after they watched this without me. "You sure can pick 'em," my mother blurted with distain. Do not make my mistake, watch it with your parents to see them squirm.

I loved this film for many reasons. For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.And the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.The script is witty and full of dark humour, "I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you.", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the 'gentleman' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.A special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned, it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead (well, perhaps not THAT bad).For once, this is a film which doesn't give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don't know what's in store for them. If you hadn't seen this before, without any knowledge of the movie, you'd be in for a huge surprise as I was.An 8/10 for it's script (thanks to Tarantino) and the actors who, while not trying too hard, make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference.

From Dusk Till Dawn is simply a fun movie. Not meant to be taken seriously at all. If you're looking for a movie to sit back and enjoy for brainless entertainment, get this. There is nothing wrong with the acting, the music really good and the special effects are gross (but great).The first half of the story revolves around the Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino). They need to get past the Mexican border to a bar named the "Titty Twister." Along the way they take hostage the Fuller family, Jacob (Harvey Keital), Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). In the second part of the movie they make it to the bar, unfortunately it is a bar run by vampires and soon enough the feasting begins.This movie is great in a lot of ways. First, the script is written brilliant, it is darkly humorous. A lot of the lines had be laughing very hard. The acting is good from all the cast and the special effects are pretty disgusting. We have decapitations, limbs getting torn off, throats getting ripped out and plenty of impalements. For gore hounds, this movie is gold. This movie never really gets boring. This movie is not meant to be anything groundbreaking, just entertaining, which it is.3½/5.

Anyone trying to do a 'serious review' of this movie needs to lighten up. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, two bad, bad men on their way to Mexico. Along the way they pick up a preacher played by Harvey Keitel and his two kids. They're supposed to meet a partner at a bar called The Titty Twister, and once they get there madness ensues. From there it takes a turn that many seem to find infuriating but I personally find highly entertaining. It's humming along like a typical Tarantino picture, and then- BOOM. Out of nowhere, it becomes all too clear that these two bad, bad men are not by a longshot the baddest in *this* bar. All of this can- and *will*, given the right attitude on the part of the viewers- read as a loving high-five to 70s zombie flicks, a homage to the campy fun of those movies. The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is astounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by Juliette Lewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and Salma Hayek in a bikini. What's not to like?

A terrific build up and then .... wham a 180 degree plot twist that really sucks. It's a lost opportunity with such an excellent cast. Still it is entertaining and Salma Hayek is smoking hot!!!

It was probably the most fun I had at the cinema back in 1996. I absolutely love "From Dusk Till Dawn", very much one of those films that you either buy into or you don't. There's no surprise element with the film, you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get - a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging "B" horror movie gore fest.The plot, for what's it's worth, sees two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) & Richie Gecko (Tarantino) on the lam after Richie breaks Seth out of prison. They are heading for the haven of Mexico with wads of cash garnered from a robbery. After overcoming a couple of fatal (for others) hiccups, the brothers, in need of a vehicle, kidnap faithless minister Jacob (Harvey Keitel), his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu). From here they must make it to a rendezvous point in Mexico - a bar called "The Titty Twister", where they will exchange cash with a friend of Seth's and start their new lives as Mexican civilians. Trouble is, is that "The Titty Twister" isn't no ordinary bar, it's a vampire stronghold and the Geko's - and their newly acquired captives, are on the menu. Can they make it till dawn and let the daylight be their saviour?.Swearing, blood, limbs severed, nudity, violence, sexual references, guns, more violence, more blood, other weapons, lots of teeth, bats, a snake, more violence. On it goes really, yet as Rodriguez and Tarantino start thrusting a blunt blade into your stomach, you really should be feeling them also caressing the funny bones in both your arms. For it's a key point that "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a damn funny film as well, something that bizarrely many critics have failed to understand. Honestly you can go to various sites and read people saying the characters are shallow, or the plot is preposterous!! Dear me, it staggers the mind. Hey don't like the film by all means, but failure to understand its genre leanings and homage persuasion is as funny as Cheech Marin is in the movie (one of many awesome "B" cult movie actors in the pic). It's bonkers and silly as hell, but once a fan of "From Dusk Till Dawn", you are a fan for life. Well as long as you don't venture out to "The Titty Twister" yourself of course..Welcome To Slavery. 9/10

From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) Review: How bout this? George Clooney in a different role? Yep. For once he tries something different.From Dusk Till Dawn is something else. This is about two criminal brothers(Clooney and Tarantino)wind up taking a family hostage to make it across the Mexican border to a meeting point, a bar called the "Titty Twister". That's where the Gecko brothers are to meet another group of crooks.....at dawn. This bar is open from dusk till dawn....and is filled with vampires.This movie starts off as something else at first. More like a gritty crime movie, then becomes a total spatter-fest. This isn't at all bad, just takes a total turn. The vampires here are a bunch of ugly as hell monsters. Think of the Evil Dead movies only the undead zombies and skeletons are vampires instead and that's the score with the very small supply of vampire slayers to take them on.Like I say, if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies, then this is the treat for you. It does not have the amount of silly humor like them, but has the gore nailed just right. The makeup effects are dead-on as well. This just happens to be more gritty than the Evil Dead.The Last Word: I like it. Good for your October needs. Did I forget Salma Hayek and Cheech Marin? They are here as well. Good bloody fun.

I remember when I first saw this movie, the first hour was awesome, amazing, I was interested, involved, and wanting more. Then everyone turned into vampires and it became an entirely different movie. It was like they took a really good drama/action movie, and combined it with a horrible B horror movie. It literally was like watching two different movies, one that was great, and one that was just plain awful, and they just happened to have the same characters, and both be about an hour long. I wish they had just stuck with the first movie, instead of seeming to say ,after writing about half, you know what would be cool, a movie about vampires that live in a Mayan temple, hey I know let's just turn this movie into that one, yeah... Awful!

Although I am not AS lovestruck with this film as many other reviewers are, I did find it an entertaining albeit conscience-churning experience.  From Dusk Till Dawn really is two films in one.  The first part tells the story of the Gecko boys(Not Geico) played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino. They are escapees from the law and have killed over a dozen people brutally already by the time the film opens.  For me, this tale of how they kill a gas station guy and finally abduct a preacher and his two children for their RV is the most chilling part of the film.  Clooney plays a guy with little moral conscience well.  Tarentino does a good job too and you can see his wit throughout the script.  I found both men very despicable, so I guess the acting was good.  The film falls into parody/farce, however, once the the whole gang(the two Geckos and the preacher and his daughter and son)reach a strip club/bar out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico.  What happens here, to the uninformed viewer, will be totally unexpected.  Does it work?  To a degree, however, the film really loses momentum and credibility it might have had.  The acting in general is all acceptable.  Harvey Keitel once again shows us why he is such a good actor.  Juliette Lewis is also very good in her role as his daughter.  Nice to see guys like Tom Savini and Fred Williamson too.  Oh, and Salma Hayek IS the highlight of the film.

Coming into this I knew it would be action over content - after all it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. The fact that the script was written by Tarantino didn't really mean anything since I had gathered from various sources that this was Tarantino's homage to the "splatstick" genre (of Evil Dead, etc.) and as a result the script probably wasn't so hot compared to Pulp Fiction.For the most part this is true. The first half of the movie IS really good in terms of cleverness and Tarantino-style stuff - good dialogue, interesting plot and unlikeable characters...unique. The second half, after they cross the border into Mexico - as others here have pointed out - becomes the Evil Dead segment of the film, where everything turns into some over-the-top, bizarre, gross-out vampire blood-'n-guts movie with bad special effects and cheesy scenes. (Albeit fun ones.) Some have complained that the transformation from seriousness to sudden vampire comic book content is too fast and the story would have been far more interesting had it been rooted in realism for its entire duration. Yes, and no. Rodriguez set out to make an homage to the spaghetti western/Evil Dead genre and did so. Tarantino's script is just the baseline for it all. It's like a bunch of friends got together and decided to make a movie - albeit friends with fairly good reputations as filmmakers. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Tarantino - not a bad cast! Had this been presented as an epic crime movie Tarantino would have helmed it. However due to the fact that he provided Rodriguez with the script and even performed a commentary track on the film's DVD release (something he does on none of his own directed films) just goes to show that Tarantino wasn't in it for the praise - he was in it for the fun and experience. Ditto for everyone else.And in that regard this is a pretty fun movie. Like Rodriguez' DESPERADO, it's a guilty pleasure for viewers and cast - a bunch of highly esteemed actors get together and have a blast.So no, this is not a great movie. The second half could be replaced with a more serious half and I think it would probably be one of the best thrillers ever if this was done. (Just imagine how great it could have been if it had been brought to a poetically justified ending with some sort of Gecko Brothers/law enforcement shootout a la Butch Cassidy/Bonnie and Clyde.) However I understand that's not what Rodriguez and crew set out to do with this movie - they just wanted to make an entertaining cult popcorn blockbuster flick.And they succeeded. It's entertaining and hip and stylish. Recommended.

Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are probably the two most recognizable faces of the generation of filmmakers who had their start in the independent scene of the early 90s. Rodriguez had a tremendous success with his western-inspired action movie "El Mariachi" while Tarantino reached fame and glory after updating heist movies in "Reservoir Dogs". Their friendship lead them to make movies together starting with "Four Rooms", but together with make-up masters Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger the two young directors crafted one of the most original movies of the 90s: "From Dusk Till Dawn".The plot starts with the escape of two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Tarantino himself) and their effort to reach Mexico kidnapping the family of a faith-less preacher named Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) who was traveling with his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and his son Scott (Ernest Liu). In their escape the group will arrive to a Mexican strip club where nothing is what it seems.The story (by Kurtzman) is a very good mix of action, western and horror cleverly put together in Tarantino's witty script. Rodriguez direction gives the film the a 70s feeling that gives the movie a Drive-In spirit pretty much in tone with the plot. In fact, at times the film feels like an updated version of exploitation action films of that era. This lack of pretensions makes it even more enjoyable as it never tries to be something else than pure entertainment.The movie is interestingly divided in two, the first half dedicated to establishing the relationships between the characters, particularly the complicated clash of the Geckos and the Fullers, in a typical Tarantino style crime/drama fashion; on the other hand, the second half is an action packed thrill ride on the style of 70s action movies that clearly shows John Carpenter's influence over Rodriguez. While it is definitely a tribute to their influences, the Rodriguez/Tarantino team create a solid movie that stands on its own as a very original take on horror movies.The acting is very effective, with George Clooney carrying the film as the cool-headed older brother who has to take care of his psychotic younger brother. Tarantino is average, but he was certainly having fun with the role. Keitel is terrific as always and is perfect as the faithless pastor who doesn't trust in God anymore. Apearances by Salma Hayek and make-up virtuoso Tom Savini have small but unforgettable roles. Savini steals the film in his role as a biker that brings back memories of his part in Romero's classic "Dawn of the Dead". All in all is a very complete and solid cast that certainly gives the movie a very special flavor.The special effects by KNB are top-notch, but the CGI used in some scenes is poor when compared to the traditional prosthetic make-up employed in the rest of the film. While the violence is never intended to be realistic, the poor CGI at times make it look more cartoon-like than what it was supposed to be, but it is not a real damaging flaw and the film is still highly enjoyable.Rodriguez has always done films to have fun, and this is what has set him apart from other filmmakers (Tarantino included). His lack of pretensions and his dedication to his craft seem to transmit the fun he has making movies to the audience who watches them. While his films may not have an introspective depth or a high philosophical meaning, they work perfectly as entertainment of the highest quality. This underrated film is probably among his best and most enjoyable films of his young career. 8/10

When I watched FDTD, I didn't have any major expectations, and so I wasn't disappointed with the result.  It took me a bit to get a hold of the sudden plot shift.  For the most part there wasn't really anything that stuck with me, except for George Clooney's tattoo and the final shot of the movie. OTOH, this is a movie that I would certainly watch again.  Partly because I like Juliette Lewis (maybe that will give you a reference point on which to compare my opinion), but also because it's a good ride while it lasts. 
Don't go looking for deep meaning where there isn't one, you'll only come out feeling cheated.  Oh, and BTW, this movie really isn't for the weak of stomach. 
I give it 65%.

Critics of "From Dusk 'Till Dawn" often dismiss it as grade Z-slasher tripe, however the film is really two separate but equal genres (hard boiled crime drama and B-horror comedy) scotch taped together.  Definitely not everyone's cup o' cinematic joe, this movie has more energy, wit and style than most high-budget Hollywood actioners.  Clooney and Tarantino make a classic duo in two powerhouse and differing performances.  T-man's script is crammed full of his usual over-the-top dialogue (if only criminals were really this interesting) and a lot of love for the conventions of B flicks from his youth.  I give it a 10.

In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock did something unthinkable in the film "Psycho". Halfway into the movie he killed off the main character (and the film's biggest star), thereby shocking the audience through sheer unpredictability while simultaneously changing the expected course of the narrative. A similar trick is employed in "From Dusk Till Dawn" (although the two films are nothing alike). For the first half the film is a kinetic crime thriller, characterised by writer Quentin Tarantino's trademark witty, hard-boiled dialogue and a clutch of well delineated characters. At the halfway point, the film suddenly switches to become an ultra-gory, ultra-violent vampire movie, almost a hyperactive homage to "Night Of The Living Dead"! It is a jarring switch; the effect is like watching half of two separate movies. There is an element of frustration that the serious crime thriller half never gets properly resolved, and similar frustration that the horror half is not introduced and built-up logically. But both halves are undeniably well-made and the actors seem to be having a great deal of fun with their outrageous roles.Psychotic criminal brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino) Gecko go on a murderous robbery spree across Texas. Their aim is to cross the Mexican border and rendezvous with one of Seth's buddies, and to ensure their safe passage they take a female hostage. When Richard kills the hostage the brothers are forced to find new ones, so they seize a family travelling in a RV - ex-preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his kids Scott (Ernest Liu) and Kate (Juliette Lewis). After a palm-sweating trip across the border the crooks and their hostages arrive at the rendezvous point, a raunchy biker-/trucker nightclub called the Titty Twister that stands in the middle of nowhere. Seth is hell-bent on getting drunk while waiting for his contact to arrive, but soon has to change his plans when it becomes apparent the Titty Twister is actually the lair of a bunch of super-strong blood-sucking vampires that have been feeding off their customers for years! An all-out gore-fest ensues as the mortals take on the vampires in a battle that literally lasts from dusk till dawn!Tarantino's intentionally vulgar, tongue-in-cheek script is complemented by the frenetic direction of his real-life pal Robert Rodriguez. They are making their own rules here, delivering a movie that cannily taps into the juvenile wish-fulfilment fantasies of tough kids, adding heaps of bad language, gore, nudity and stylized violence. The special effects are quite good, with limbs being ripped out and vampire bodies melting and burning and exploding left, right and centre. Clooney turns in a spirited star-making performance, while Tarantino is OK as his unbalanced brother. Keitel is clearly much too good for his role as the disillusioned preacher but in spite of this he slums it with considerable spirit. Similarly, Lewis doesn't have to register much real acting emotion as the hostage daughter but she enters into the simple-minded violent action with panache. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a raucous, self-indulgent action/comedy/road movie/horror flick - crazy nonsense that was great fun for the cast and crew to make, and is a guilty pleasure for the audience to watch.

Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk till Dawn combines vicious violence, Cheech Marin vampires, and some funny humor from the cast into one big collective film.  More than a basic horror movie, it has Rodriquez as a fine director and Quentin Tarantino as a good screenwriter who bring to the screen basic shoot em up fun.  Not all of it is for the people out there, but for thrill seeking teens, it's worth a glance.The story involves 2 criminal brothers (George Clooney and Tarantino) who are part focused and part insane.  They kidnap a family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis) and bring them to a bar called the T**y twister while waiting for morning and their money prize.  But what ensues in that bar is terrific fun in which all the members are vampires and are relentless "from dusk till dawn".  Great fun, terrific violence (if not disgusting) and cool quotes bring this film to a fine T.  Look for Tom Savini as Sex Machine, Salma Hayek as a stripper and Cheech Marin who plays 3 characters.  A+

From Dusk Til Dawn is definitely a movie of two halfsIt starts off well enough, with the hellish Gecko brothers (Cooney and Tarantino) shooting and hijacking their way across Texas, picking up the hapless Harvey Keitel and family en route. The dialogue is sharp and the Geckos are a humourous, if unsympathetic, pair. Tarantino, as a rapist and psychotic given to hearing voices which tell him, basically, whatever he wants to hear, is both scary and funny.So far so good. Until the mobile home carrying the desperados and their hostages goes over into Mexico and stops at a garish biker/trucker bar which must be one of the sleaziest joints ever portrayed in the history of Hollywood. Unfortunately, for the viewer as well as the characters, it proves to be a lair of vampires!Selma Hayek performs one of the most sexily outrageous dance routines of all time but proves to be a vampire rather than a vamp. (Too bad - Juliette Lewis is one of the films liabilities, seeming to have a movie career based on being a piece of baggage for psychotic and violent men to tote around, without any deeper discernable skills on offer than the ability to pout when the bullets are flying)Once Tarantino is dead (or undead, however you care to look at it) the movie is committed to being an out and out actioner with bursts of spoof putdowns of vampire movie cliches. Cooney, Keitel (who gives a first rate, understated performance as the disillusioned preacher / hi jack victim) and the two junior vampire hunters backing them up don't look as if they could bruise a bag of apples, let alone hold out all night against the legions of the undead. Fortunately, more convincing help is on hand in the shape of grim faced veteran Fred Williamson and ace horror make up artist Tom Savini, who steals scene after scene as whip cracking biker, 'Sex Machine'Having said this, the movie rips along at a good pace whilst never quite being able to live up to the movies from which it borrows (Carpenter's 'Assault On Precinct 13' and G. A. Romero's 'Living Dead' films).I'm in two minds about whether to rate it higher or lower than average, but I'll ignore the worst parts and rate 'From Dusk Til Dawn' a blood sucking 7 out of 10 (The vampires might get me if I don't, though if one is Selma Hayek, this might not be as bad as bus ride with Juliette Lewis)

From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) is one of my personal favorite vampire films of all time. The best excellent action horror 90's insanlly entertaining movie from director Robert Rodriguez and writter Quentin Tarantino. In my opinion it is their best film, I love this film to death. I am huge fan of this movie. This and Fright Night (1985) are my favorite vampire films but From Dusk Till Dawn is my number 1 favorite Vampire film of all time it is above Fright Night (1985)."Welcome to slavery, No, thanks. I've already had a wife."I like Robert Rodriguez: Not Hughe fan of El Mariachi, but I love Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico with Johnny Depp, I would say those two are great films he directed. The Faculty I like a lot, i watch it as a teen on VHS have not seen the movie in a while, but a good sci-fi horror movie of the 90's. Quentin Tarantino his movies I like Kill Bill: Vol. , Jackie Brown was okay movie and Pulp Fiction I really love, I have not seen that movie in a long time. I love Rodriguez and Tarantino this is my favorite film they ever did together, my all time favorite. Quentin Tarantino wrote the script and acted, he did a great job I love his character Richard Gecko. My favorite George Clooney film as Seth Gecko the best one he ever did. I like The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman, I don't mind him in that film. Clooney never played a character as cool like this one again. Three years ago was 20th anniversary, this film come out in 1996 in which that time was a hit.The film was wery well written it has great cast: George Clooney,
Juliette Lewis, Quentin Tarantino does a fine as Richie Gecko brother of the brothers Gecko famous bank robbers. You have Harvey Keitel as a preacher, who lost his wife and has 2 kids one of them is Juliette Lewis. Cheech Marin is in three roles which is fun. Danny Trejo is in here I think he was in all three From Dusk Till Dawn movies. You have Fred Williamson which I love his character Frost, he is Vietnam Vet he was in Vietnam 1972, he killed single handly all VC platoon. We have Tom Savini who is a horror master in FX effects as Sex Machine. Kelly Preston, Salma Hayek, John Saxon and Michael Parks are in here really excellent cast.The first hour has characters arc build which it works still today. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the bad guys. They are not the good guys in here, they are not bank robbers with heart of gold, they are bad boys and they will kill you for real. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are in this bar Titty Twister and vampires appear and Clooney, Tom Savini, Fred Willamson are killing all those vampires. You have table of four legs and Fred Williamson pins them all. Tom Savini stakes Danny Trejo in a bad-ass scene. I love those Vampires, I love the effects how they look. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel are fighting vampires who are attacking them. Ghoulies and zombie typs love the effects. George Clooney has Jack Hammer with a stake and he kills the vampires. Harvey Keitel has a shotgun with a cross and shoots the vampires. Juliette Lewis has crossbow, she shots with arrows the vampires, she is a bad-ass. I love the actress to death.The score is well done, I absolutelly love the soundtrack: Dark Night by The Blasters such a cool song love the soundtrack to death. I am going to gave that song in my cell phone. I love She's Just Killing Me by ZZ Top those 2 soundtracks are cool. I really love those cool songs this movie has.Great dialogue in the film, I love George Clooney I love his character, he is an anti-hero, he is a lead guy in here, I like him and he does a great job. The action is well done. It is Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. It has gore, lots of bodys, great kills, bad-ass film. We have little action in the store in the open scene. Great well done practical effects, no CGI effects in here, great flamable explosion and epic finale. This movie with Aliens (1986), Levithan (1989), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) is my personal favorite horror monster film of all time. My deep review of my personal favorite vampire film of all time, it is insanly entertaining movie that I love it to death.

A movie that will have you laughing at the sheer absurdity of its scenes. The corny scenes fit the tone of the film as well. Practical effects are better in some scenes than others but overall it works throughout the film. It's a nice change of pace from the first half of the film to the second. A good Halloween monster flick and has a solid Clooney performance.

Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it. But it doesn't quite work that way. You're only good while you continue doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: Just what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But, of course, we never do. And the Clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. That's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. Did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he, as writer, assume we would find the rape, gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). On every level  except the technical  this film stinks. Avoid.

The first half of this film is like anything you'd expect from Quentin Tarintino and Robert Rodriguez: cool 70's soundtrack, snappy dialogue, really good editing, lots of violence, and a slightly unconvincing role by QT himself. I thought it was disturbing, stylish and pretty good for the first half, and was enjoying it.And then they get to the Titty Twister, where there are lots and lots of vampires and lots of blood and nudity, and lots of fighting, and, for me, it just went completely downhill. It felt silly and just inappropriate from what we'd seen at the beginning, and I actually got a little bored.That being said, I really liked Harvey Kietel's performance and George Clooney was much better than I'd thought he'd be. Plus, Salma Hayek is one sexy kitten.So yeah, half a good film. If you love over the top vampire films though complete with dated effects, then go for it, because you might just like it

I enjoyed this film, but I was left a little puzzled at the end by what I'd just watched in terms of what type of movie this is.It starts off as a very Tarantino-esquire film, it's clear that he wrote it as his famous dialogue is present. It's an enjoyable crime thriller much along the lines of Tarantino's other works (such as Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs) but with a bit of Robert Rodriguez flare shown during the action sequences.Then with about 50-ish minutes left, the style film changes entirely. It becomes another film, it goes from stylish crime thriller to random vampire action movie. It's almost as if Tarantino left the room while writing the script and somebody wrote the rest of the film for him, it loses it's Tarantino charm and becomes a predictable, gore fest, vampire flick.I'm a fan of Vampire films, so I still enjoyed the movie, but I can see why others don't like it. The acting is of high quality, especially from Geroge Clooney who outdoes himself, and in parts saves the film.8/10 - Watch with an open mind.

I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more "meta" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film.This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.

I have to say that this is actually a good movie although it does lose it's way towards the end. The final 15 minutes I thought were a little crappy. I prefer more realism in my vampires but having said that, I cannot fault Tarantino, his is perfect in the role as the twisted Richard Gecko, and although I don't usually like George Clooney he was surprisingly cool as Seth. There are some funny moments that you have to have a slightly twisted humour to appreciate (which I do!) and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is an entertaining movie. If you like overacting, lots and lots of blood and Tarantino movies then go see.

When the movie started, I was sold to a crime movie. The intro was the perfect setup for a Tarantino film. Two criminal brothers on the run trying to get to Mexico. Simple and brilliant.The movie introduced two hot-headed brothers, so you know crap was gonna hit the fan and duels were gonna go down. It had everything I wanted: black comedy, crime, suspense, drama, thriller, even Salma Hayek.At that point, everything was perfect... but then, the vampires appeared and the whole film had a 180 degree turn. It just didn't fit with the rest of the movie.I'm not gonna lie, the different ways of how they killed the vampires were pretty cool and creative, but I felt like the first half of the movie was made by Tarantino and the second half was made by Rodriguez.This movie had a lot of potential if it stuck with the first plot. I would've rated higher if they would've continued Gecko Brothers' adventure.

'From Dusk Till Dawn' is kind of brilliant, brutal, bloody, Tarantino, horror, silly and funny. It is brilliant, brutal, bloody, horror, silly and funny the way Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead'-series is all those things, the twist here is a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. This means the first hour is just brutal and bloody, sometimes a little funny, in the 'Pulp Fiction' kind of way.We see two brothers named Seth (George Clooney) and Richie Gecko (Quentin Tarantino). They are bank robbers, although they do the occasional killing as well. We learn they want to reach the Mexican border. That the entire state of Texas and the FBI are looking for them is a problem so they force the Fuller family to bring them across the border with their motor home. Father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) used to be a minister but gave up faith after his wife died in a car crash. He travels with his adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis).So we have the first hour, filled with Tarantino-stuff in its dialogue and references, and then the party arrives at a bar called the Titty Twister. Not long after they are inside it is revealed that every crew member from the bar is actually a vampire, feeding themselves on bikers and truckers that visit the place. The Fullers and Geckos survive together with a guy who calls himself Sex Machine (Tom Savini) and a guy named Frost (Fred Williamson). Now they are a team and face vampires as their opponents.You see how this movie is actually two movies. Especially the second part will find a smaller audience and in a way I was a little curious how the first part would have ended if they kept it as serious as it was. Still, because the movie shifts the way it does it becomes quite original. We have a crime movie to start and a horror comedy, really in the Sam Raimi way, to end. If you are able to take it the way it comes, not too serious, there is a good chance you might like it. Even the gore is presented in a silly way, making it less gory.Clooney's cool performance, the fitting soundtrack, some hilarious moments, Tarantino's fine touches all make this a highly original, quite bloody, vampire adventure. If you are a genre fan don't miss it, if you are not you might give it a try and be pleasantly surprised.

George Clooney should have stuck will this kind of role. He did fine in Out of Sight and Ocean's Eleven, but he really dominated this movie with a fury that we may never see again. Almost every line he delivers is memorable and that is not all Tarantino's doing. The rest of the cast is dominated by cool cameos and veteran cult and mainstream names. The exception being Ernest Liu who does a good job of holding his own. No Tarantino film would be complete without a good soundtrack. This one, as with Desperado, features songs by Tito and Tarantula. Although I have only heard four songs by them, I consider them one of my favorites. I will never forget what my parents told me after they watched this without me. "You sure can pick 'em," my mother blurted with distain. Do not make my mistake, watch it with your parents to see them squirm.

I loved this film for many reasons. For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.And the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.The script is witty and full of dark humour, "I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you.", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the 'gentleman' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.A special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned, it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead (well, perhaps not THAT bad).For once, this is a film which doesn't give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don't know what's in store for them. If you hadn't seen this before, without any knowledge of the movie, you'd be in for a huge surprise as I was.An 8/10 for it's script (thanks to Tarantino) and the actors who, while not trying too hard, make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference.

From Dusk Till Dawn is simply a fun movie. Not meant to be taken seriously at all. If you're looking for a movie to sit back and enjoy for brainless entertainment, get this. There is nothing wrong with the acting, the music really good and the special effects are gross (but great).The first half of the story revolves around the Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino). They need to get past the Mexican border to a bar named the "Titty Twister." Along the way they take hostage the Fuller family, Jacob (Harvey Keital), Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). In the second part of the movie they make it to the bar, unfortunately it is a bar run by vampires and soon enough the feasting begins.This movie is great in a lot of ways. First, the script is written brilliant, it is darkly humorous. A lot of the lines had be laughing very hard. The acting is good from all the cast and the special effects are pretty disgusting. We have decapitations, limbs getting torn off, throats getting ripped out and plenty of impalements. For gore hounds, this movie is gold. This movie never really gets boring. This movie is not meant to be anything groundbreaking, just entertaining, which it is.3½/5.

Anyone trying to do a 'serious review' of this movie needs to lighten up. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, two bad, bad men on their way to Mexico. Along the way they pick up a preacher played by Harvey Keitel and his two kids. They're supposed to meet a partner at a bar called The Titty Twister, and once they get there madness ensues. From there it takes a turn that many seem to find infuriating but I personally find highly entertaining. It's humming along like a typical Tarantino picture, and then- BOOM. Out of nowhere, it becomes all too clear that these two bad, bad men are not by a longshot the baddest in *this* bar. All of this can- and *will*, given the right attitude on the part of the viewers- read as a loving high-five to 70s zombie flicks, a homage to the campy fun of those movies. The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is astounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by Juliette Lewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and Salma Hayek in a bikini. What's not to like?

A terrific build up and then .... wham a 180 degree plot twist that really sucks. It's a lost opportunity with such an excellent cast. Still it is entertaining and Salma Hayek is smoking hot!!!

It was probably the most fun I had at the cinema back in 1996. I absolutely love "From Dusk Till Dawn", very much one of those films that you either buy into or you don't. There's no surprise element with the film, you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get - a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging "B" horror movie gore fest.The plot, for what's it's worth, sees two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) & Richie Gecko (Tarantino) on the lam after Richie breaks Seth out of prison. They are heading for the haven of Mexico with wads of cash garnered from a robbery. After overcoming a couple of fatal (for others) hiccups, the brothers, in need of a vehicle, kidnap faithless minister Jacob (Harvey Keitel), his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu). From here they must make it to a rendezvous point in Mexico - a bar called "The Titty Twister", where they will exchange cash with a friend of Seth's and start their new lives as Mexican civilians. Trouble is, is that "The Titty Twister" isn't no ordinary bar, it's a vampire stronghold and the Geko's - and their newly acquired captives, are on the menu. Can they make it till dawn and let the daylight be their saviour?.Swearing, blood, limbs severed, nudity, violence, sexual references, guns, more violence, more blood, other weapons, lots of teeth, bats, a snake, more violence. On it goes really, yet as Rodriguez and Tarantino start thrusting a blunt blade into your stomach, you really should be feeling them also caressing the funny bones in both your arms. For it's a key point that "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a damn funny film as well, something that bizarrely many critics have failed to understand. Honestly you can go to various sites and read people saying the characters are shallow, or the plot is preposterous!! Dear me, it staggers the mind. Hey don't like the film by all means, but failure to understand its genre leanings and homage persuasion is as funny as Cheech Marin is in the movie (one of many awesome "B" cult movie actors in the pic). It's bonkers and silly as hell, but once a fan of "From Dusk Till Dawn", you are a fan for life. Well as long as you don't venture out to "The Titty Twister" yourself of course..Welcome To Slavery. 9/10

From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) Review: How bout this? George Clooney in a different role? Yep. For once he tries something different.From Dusk Till Dawn is something else. This is about two criminal brothers(Clooney and Tarantino)wind up taking a family hostage to make it across the Mexican border to a meeting point, a bar called the "Titty Twister". That's where the Gecko brothers are to meet another group of crooks.....at dawn. This bar is open from dusk till dawn....and is filled with vampires.This movie starts off as something else at first. More like a gritty crime movie, then becomes a total spatter-fest. This isn't at all bad, just takes a total turn. The vampires here are a bunch of ugly as hell monsters. Think of the Evil Dead movies only the undead zombies and skeletons are vampires instead and that's the score with the very small supply of vampire slayers to take them on.Like I say, if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies, then this is the treat for you. It does not have the amount of silly humor like them, but has the gore nailed just right. The makeup effects are dead-on as well. This just happens to be more gritty than the Evil Dead.The Last Word: I like it. Good for your October needs. Did I forget Salma Hayek and Cheech Marin? They are here as well. Good bloody fun.

I remember when I first saw this movie, the first hour was awesome, amazing, I was interested, involved, and wanting more. Then everyone turned into vampires and it became an entirely different movie. It was like they took a really good drama/action movie, and combined it with a horrible B horror movie. It literally was like watching two different movies, one that was great, and one that was just plain awful, and they just happened to have the same characters, and both be about an hour long. I wish they had just stuck with the first movie, instead of seeming to say ,after writing about half, you know what would be cool, a movie about vampires that live in a Mayan temple, hey I know let's just turn this movie into that one, yeah... Awful!

Although I am not AS lovestruck with this film as many other reviewers are, I did find it an entertaining albeit conscience-churning experience.  From Dusk Till Dawn really is two films in one.  The first part tells the story of the Gecko boys(Not Geico) played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino. They are escapees from the law and have killed over a dozen people brutally already by the time the film opens.  For me, this tale of how they kill a gas station guy and finally abduct a preacher and his two children for their RV is the most chilling part of the film.  Clooney plays a guy with little moral conscience well.  Tarentino does a good job too and you can see his wit throughout the script.  I found both men very despicable, so I guess the acting was good.  The film falls into parody/farce, however, once the the whole gang(the two Geckos and the preacher and his daughter and son)reach a strip club/bar out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico.  What happens here, to the uninformed viewer, will be totally unexpected.  Does it work?  To a degree, however, the film really loses momentum and credibility it might have had.  The acting in general is all acceptable.  Harvey Keitel once again shows us why he is such a good actor.  Juliette Lewis is also very good in her role as his daughter.  Nice to see guys like Tom Savini and Fred Williamson too.  Oh, and Salma Hayek IS the highlight of the film.

Coming into this I knew it would be action over content - after all it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. The fact that the script was written by Tarantino didn't really mean anything since I had gathered from various sources that this was Tarantino's homage to the "splatstick" genre (of Evil Dead, etc.) and as a result the script probably wasn't so hot compared to Pulp Fiction.For the most part this is true. The first half of the movie IS really good in terms of cleverness and Tarantino-style stuff - good dialogue, interesting plot and unlikeable characters...unique. The second half, after they cross the border into Mexico - as others here have pointed out - becomes the Evil Dead segment of the film, where everything turns into some over-the-top, bizarre, gross-out vampire blood-'n-guts movie with bad special effects and cheesy scenes. (Albeit fun ones.) Some have complained that the transformation from seriousness to sudden vampire comic book content is too fast and the story would have been far more interesting had it been rooted in realism for its entire duration. Yes, and no. Rodriguez set out to make an homage to the spaghetti western/Evil Dead genre and did so. Tarantino's script is just the baseline for it all. It's like a bunch of friends got together and decided to make a movie - albeit friends with fairly good reputations as filmmakers. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Tarantino - not a bad cast! Had this been presented as an epic crime movie Tarantino would have helmed it. However due to the fact that he provided Rodriguez with the script and even performed a commentary track on the film's DVD release (something he does on none of his own directed films) just goes to show that Tarantino wasn't in it for the praise - he was in it for the fun and experience. Ditto for everyone else.And in that regard this is a pretty fun movie. Like Rodriguez' DESPERADO, it's a guilty pleasure for viewers and cast - a bunch of highly esteemed actors get together and have a blast.So no, this is not a great movie. The second half could be replaced with a more serious half and I think it would probably be one of the best thrillers ever if this was done. (Just imagine how great it could have been if it had been brought to a poetically justified ending with some sort of Gecko Brothers/law enforcement shootout a la Butch Cassidy/Bonnie and Clyde.) However I understand that's not what Rodriguez and crew set out to do with this movie - they just wanted to make an entertaining cult popcorn blockbuster flick.And they succeeded. It's entertaining and hip and stylish. Recommended.

Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are probably the two most recognizable faces of the generation of filmmakers who had their start in the independent scene of the early 90s. Rodriguez had a tremendous success with his western-inspired action movie "El Mariachi" while Tarantino reached fame and glory after updating heist movies in "Reservoir Dogs". Their friendship lead them to make movies together starting with "Four Rooms", but together with make-up masters Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger the two young directors crafted one of the most original movies of the 90s: "From Dusk Till Dawn".The plot starts with the escape of two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Tarantino himself) and their effort to reach Mexico kidnapping the family of a faith-less preacher named Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) who was traveling with his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and his son Scott (Ernest Liu). In their escape the group will arrive to a Mexican strip club where nothing is what it seems.The story (by Kurtzman) is a very good mix of action, western and horror cleverly put together in Tarantino's witty script. Rodriguez direction gives the film the a 70s feeling that gives the movie a Drive-In spirit pretty much in tone with the plot. In fact, at times the film feels like an updated version of exploitation action films of that era. This lack of pretensions makes it even more enjoyable as it never tries to be something else than pure entertainment.The movie is interestingly divided in two, the first half dedicated to establishing the relationships between the characters, particularly the complicated clash of the Geckos and the Fullers, in a typical Tarantino style crime/drama fashion; on the other hand, the second half is an action packed thrill ride on the style of 70s action movies that clearly shows John Carpenter's influence over Rodriguez. While it is definitely a tribute to their influences, the Rodriguez/Tarantino team create a solid movie that stands on its own as a very original take on horror movies.The acting is very effective, with George Clooney carrying the film as the cool-headed older brother who has to take care of his psychotic younger brother. Tarantino is average, but he was certainly having fun with the role. Keitel is terrific as always and is perfect as the faithless pastor who doesn't trust in God anymore. Apearances by Salma Hayek and make-up virtuoso Tom Savini have small but unforgettable roles. Savini steals the film in his role as a biker that brings back memories of his part in Romero's classic "Dawn of the Dead". All in all is a very complete and solid cast that certainly gives the movie a very special flavor.The special effects by KNB are top-notch, but the CGI used in some scenes is poor when compared to the traditional prosthetic make-up employed in the rest of the film. While the violence is never intended to be realistic, the poor CGI at times make it look more cartoon-like than what it was supposed to be, but it is not a real damaging flaw and the film is still highly enjoyable.Rodriguez has always done films to have fun, and this is what has set him apart from other filmmakers (Tarantino included). His lack of pretensions and his dedication to his craft seem to transmit the fun he has making movies to the audience who watches them. While his films may not have an introspective depth or a high philosophical meaning, they work perfectly as entertainment of the highest quality. This underrated film is probably among his best and most enjoyable films of his young career. 8/10

In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock did something unthinkable in the film "Psycho". Halfway into the movie he killed off the main character (and the film's biggest star), thereby shocking the audience through sheer unpredictability while simultaneously changing the expected course of the narrative. A similar trick is employed in "From Dusk Till Dawn" (although the two films are nothing alike). For the first half the film is a kinetic crime thriller, characterised by writer Quentin Tarantino's trademark witty, hard-boiled dialogue and a clutch of well delineated characters. At the halfway point, the film suddenly switches to become an ultra-gory, ultra-violent vampire movie, almost a hyperactive homage to "Night Of The Living Dead"! It is a jarring switch; the effect is like watching half of two separate movies. There is an element of frustration that the serious crime thriller half never gets properly resolved, and similar frustration that the horror half is not introduced and built-up logically. But both halves are undeniably well-made and the actors seem to be having a great deal of fun with their outrageous roles.Psychotic criminal brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino) Gecko go on a murderous robbery spree across Texas. Their aim is to cross the Mexican border and rendezvous with one of Seth's buddies, and to ensure their safe passage they take a female hostage. When Richard kills the hostage the brothers are forced to find new ones, so they seize a family travelling in a RV - ex-preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his kids Scott (Ernest Liu) and Kate (Juliette Lewis). After a palm-sweating trip across the border the crooks and their hostages arrive at the rendezvous point, a raunchy biker-/trucker nightclub called the Titty Twister that stands in the middle of nowhere. Seth is hell-bent on getting drunk while waiting for his contact to arrive, but soon has to change his plans when it becomes apparent the Titty Twister is actually the lair of a bunch of super-strong blood-sucking vampires that have been feeding off their customers for years! An all-out gore-fest ensues as the mortals take on the vampires in a battle that literally lasts from dusk till dawn!Tarantino's intentionally vulgar, tongue-in-cheek script is complemented by the frenetic direction of his real-life pal Robert Rodriguez. They are making their own rules here, delivering a movie that cannily taps into the juvenile wish-fulfilment fantasies of tough kids, adding heaps of bad language, gore, nudity and stylized violence. The special effects are quite good, with limbs being ripped out and vampire bodies melting and burning and exploding left, right and centre. Clooney turns in a spirited star-making performance, while Tarantino is OK as his unbalanced brother. Keitel is clearly much too good for his role as the disillusioned preacher but in spite of this he slums it with considerable spirit. Similarly, Lewis doesn't have to register much real acting emotion as the hostage daughter but she enters into the simple-minded violent action with panache. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a raucous, self-indulgent action/comedy/road movie/horror flick - crazy nonsense that was great fun for the cast and crew to make, and is a guilty pleasure for the audience to watch.

Critics of "From Dusk 'Till Dawn" often dismiss it as grade Z-slasher tripe, however the film is really two separate but equal genres (hard boiled crime drama and B-horror comedy) scotch taped together.  Definitely not everyone's cup o' cinematic joe, this movie has more energy, wit and style than most high-budget Hollywood actioners.  Clooney and Tarantino make a classic duo in two powerhouse and differing performances.  T-man's script is crammed full of his usual over-the-top dialogue (if only criminals were really this interesting) and a lot of love for the conventions of B flicks from his youth.  I give it a 10.

When I watched FDTD, I didn't have any major expectations, and so I wasn't disappointed with the result.  It took me a bit to get a hold of the sudden plot shift.  For the most part there wasn't really anything that stuck with me, except for George Clooney's tattoo and the final shot of the movie. OTOH, this is a movie that I would certainly watch again.  Partly because I like Juliette Lewis (maybe that will give you a reference point on which to compare my opinion), but also because it's a good ride while it lasts. 
Don't go looking for deep meaning where there isn't one, you'll only come out feeling cheated.  Oh, and BTW, this movie really isn't for the weak of stomach. 
I give it 65%.

Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk till Dawn combines vicious violence, Cheech Marin vampires, and some funny humor from the cast into one big collective film.  More than a basic horror movie, it has Rodriquez as a fine director and Quentin Tarantino as a good screenwriter who bring to the screen basic shoot em up fun.  Not all of it is for the people out there, but for thrill seeking teens, it's worth a glance.The story involves 2 criminal brothers (George Clooney and Tarantino) who are part focused and part insane.  They kidnap a family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis) and bring them to a bar called the T**y twister while waiting for morning and their money prize.  But what ensues in that bar is terrific fun in which all the members are vampires and are relentless "from dusk till dawn".  Great fun, terrific violence (if not disgusting) and cool quotes bring this film to a fine T.  Look for Tom Savini as Sex Machine, Salma Hayek as a stripper and Cheech Marin who plays 3 characters.  A+

From Dusk Til Dawn is definitely a movie of two halfsIt starts off well enough, with the hellish Gecko brothers (Cooney and Tarantino) shooting and hijacking their way across Texas, picking up the hapless Harvey Keitel and family en route. The dialogue is sharp and the Geckos are a humourous, if unsympathetic, pair. Tarantino, as a rapist and psychotic given to hearing voices which tell him, basically, whatever he wants to hear, is both scary and funny.So far so good. Until the mobile home carrying the desperados and their hostages goes over into Mexico and stops at a garish biker/trucker bar which must be one of the sleaziest joints ever portrayed in the history of Hollywood. Unfortunately, for the viewer as well as the characters, it proves to be a lair of vampires!Selma Hayek performs one of the most sexily outrageous dance routines of all time but proves to be a vampire rather than a vamp. (Too bad - Juliette Lewis is one of the films liabilities, seeming to have a movie career based on being a piece of baggage for psychotic and violent men to tote around, without any deeper discernable skills on offer than the ability to pout when the bullets are flying)Once Tarantino is dead (or undead, however you care to look at it) the movie is committed to being an out and out actioner with bursts of spoof putdowns of vampire movie cliches. Cooney, Keitel (who gives a first rate, understated performance as the disillusioned preacher / hi jack victim) and the two junior vampire hunters backing them up don't look as if they could bruise a bag of apples, let alone hold out all night against the legions of the undead. Fortunately, more convincing help is on hand in the shape of grim faced veteran Fred Williamson and ace horror make up artist Tom Savini, who steals scene after scene as whip cracking biker, 'Sex Machine'Having said this, the movie rips along at a good pace whilst never quite being able to live up to the movies from which it borrows (Carpenter's 'Assault On Precinct 13' and G. A. Romero's 'Living Dead' films).I'm in two minds about whether to rate it higher or lower than average, but I'll ignore the worst parts and rate 'From Dusk Til Dawn' a blood sucking 7 out of 10 (The vampires might get me if I don't, though if one is Selma Hayek, this might not be as bad as bus ride with Juliette Lewis)

From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) is one of my personal favorite vampire films of all time. The best excellent action horror 90's insanlly entertaining movie from director Robert Rodriguez and writter Quentin Tarantino. In my opinion it is their best film, I love this film to death. I am huge fan of this movie. This and Fright Night (1985) are my favorite vampire films but From Dusk Till Dawn is my number 1 favorite Vampire film of all time it is above Fright Night (1985)."Welcome to slavery, No, thanks. I've already had a wife."I like Robert Rodriguez: Not Hughe fan of El Mariachi, but I love Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico with Johnny Depp, I would say those two are great films he directed. The Faculty I like a lot, i watch it as a teen on VHS have not seen the movie in a while, but a good sci-fi horror movie of the 90's. Quentin Tarantino his movies I like Kill Bill: Vol. , Jackie Brown was okay movie and Pulp Fiction I really love, I have not seen that movie in a long time. I love Rodriguez and Tarantino this is my favorite film they ever did together, my all time favorite. Quentin Tarantino wrote the script and acted, he did a great job I love his character Richard Gecko. My favorite George Clooney film as Seth Gecko the best one he ever did. I like The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman, I don't mind him in that film. Clooney never played a character as cool like this one again. Three years ago was 20th anniversary, this film come out in 1996 in which that time was a hit.The film was wery well written it has great cast: George Clooney,
Juliette Lewis, Quentin Tarantino does a fine as Richie Gecko brother of the brothers Gecko famous bank robbers. You have Harvey Keitel as a preacher, who lost his wife and has 2 kids one of them is Juliette Lewis. Cheech Marin is in three roles which is fun. Danny Trejo is in here I think he was in all three From Dusk Till Dawn movies. You have Fred Williamson which I love his character Frost, he is Vietnam Vet he was in Vietnam 1972, he killed single handly all VC platoon. We have Tom Savini who is a horror master in FX effects as Sex Machine. Kelly Preston, Salma Hayek, John Saxon and Michael Parks are in here really excellent cast.The first hour has characters arc build which it works still today. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the bad guys. They are not the good guys in here, they are not bank robbers with heart of gold, they are bad boys and they will kill you for real. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are in this bar Titty Twister and vampires appear and Clooney, Tom Savini, Fred Willamson are killing all those vampires. You have table of four legs and Fred Williamson pins them all. Tom Savini stakes Danny Trejo in a bad-ass scene. I love those Vampires, I love the effects how they look. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel are fighting vampires who are attacking them. Ghoulies and zombie typs love the effects. George Clooney has Jack Hammer with a stake and he kills the vampires. Harvey Keitel has a shotgun with a cross and shoots the vampires. Juliette Lewis has crossbow, she shots with arrows the vampires, she is a bad-ass. I love the actress to death.The score is well done, I absolutelly love the soundtrack: Dark Night by The Blasters such a cool song love the soundtrack to death. I am going to gave that song in my cell phone. I love She's Just Killing Me by ZZ Top those 2 soundtracks are cool. I really love those cool songs this movie has.Great dialogue in the film, I love George Clooney I love his character, he is an anti-hero, he is a lead guy in here, I like him and he does a great job. The action is well done. It is Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. It has gore, lots of bodys, great kills, bad-ass film. We have little action in the store in the open scene. Great well done practical effects, no CGI effects in here, great flamable explosion and epic finale. This movie with Aliens (1986), Levithan (1989), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) is my personal favorite horror monster film of all time. My deep review of my personal favorite vampire film of all time, it is insanly entertaining movie that I love it to death.

A movie that will have you laughing at the sheer absurdity of its scenes. The corny scenes fit the tone of the film as well. Practical effects are better in some scenes than others but overall it works throughout the film. It's a nice change of pace from the first half of the film to the second. A good Halloween monster flick and has a solid Clooney performance.

Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it. But it doesn't quite work that way. You're only good while you continue doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: Just what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But, of course, we never do. And the Clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. That's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. Did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he, as writer, assume we would find the rape, gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). On every level  except the technical  this film stinks. Avoid.
