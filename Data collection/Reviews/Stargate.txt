Stargate is a terrific movie that has produced 2 hit TV shows, conventions and fans from all over the world. This movie started it all. I found it in my Uncle's basement and decided to watch it. It has an interesting storyline tying in Ancient Egyptian Mythology to make it even more interesting. It's about a struggling archaeologist with strange ideas about the gods and rulers of Ancient Egypt. Only one person is willing to believe him, and recruits him for a translator. What they find is even more amazing than they expected.It's a highly underrated movie, in my opinion it's better than most sci-fi movies and very interesting.

When scientists and historians finally figure out the meaning of an ancient Egyptian artifact, it opens a portal to another planet.Stargate was panned by the critics on its release, no A list stars they cried, a plot line that bore a resemblance to a 1970 film called Erinnerungen an die Zukunft, and apparently caught between being an adult picture and a child friendly blockbuster. Those critics were forced to eat their words as Stargate promptly went on to be a monster smash, making $196,567,262 worldwide, and spawning a hugely popular TV series. It is for sure a no brain popcorn piece, suspension of disbelief should be at the forefront of any prospective first time viewer, but it's great fun and snazzy in all its set piece work.Led by square jawed Kurt Russell as an on the edge Colonel, our band of merry men adventurers face peril in their new world via the weather, language barriers with the locals, oh and something a touch more sinister!. James Spader does an impressive turn as a geeky Egyptologist, on who's fate the groups survival may well rest, while Jaye Davidson serves a reminder that yes, he did act in movies many years ago. It's cliché ridden, and most of it is hacked together from far better pictures in the genres that Stargate wants to emulate, but it's damn entertaining and looks fabulous in High Definition. 7/10

Not many people know this yet, but I'm writing the next Emmerich film. Yes. It's going to have a lead who's a dorky, socially awkward, extremely smart yet ignored scientist of some field that will relate to the plot, which will be something big, requiring a lot of costumed extras and loud special effects, and be set or deal with something fantastic that isn't that closely linked to reality. Seriously though, for using the same basic formula, his flicks tend to be fun and enjoyable escapism. Plus, this marks the possibly unique occasion of James Spader not(!) playing the role of a sexual deviant in the movie he's in. I guess he wanted to branch out. Russell, as expected, nails his part as the hardened military man who does have a heart, and in general the acting is great. The story is interesting enough, and it develops fine throughout. Pacing is good, and this does notably not overwhelm or overstimulate the audience, in spite of presenting a world that we can't directly relate to. Stephen Sommers, are you paying attention? The FX are excellent. This is exciting, entertaining and cool. The action is awesome and not excessive. As for music, this uses a broad, sweeping score, and that works well. The humor is reasonable, the jokes and gags are hit and miss. There is infrequent mild to moderately strong language and a little violence and one or two hints towards sexuality in this. I recommend this to any and all fans of those who made it, particularly Roland. 7/10

Stargate starts in 1928 in Giza where an archaeological dig uncovers an alien Stargate used to travel between worlds. Jump forward to the 'Present Day' where Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has radical theories that the Pyramids weren't constructed by the Egyptians, he is contacted by Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) & given the opportunity to prove his theories. Langford takes Jackson to an underground Military facility where no-one has been able to work out how to operate the mysterious Stargate, within a couple of weeks Jackson has it all figured out. A mission is undertaken to travel through the Stargate to a distant planet & investigate the alien world on the other side...This French American co-production was co-written & directed by Roland Emmerich & is a fine sci-fi adventure film that holds up very well even when viewed today nearly fifteen years after it was made which is a feat in itself since a lot of sci-fi dates badly very quickly. Originally the rough cut for Stargate was apparently three hours long, it was eventually released into theatres at two hours long & has subsequently been released in a 'Director's Cut' that adds about ten more minutes to the theatrical cut, having said that I will be basing my comments on the original two hour theatrical version. The script by Emmerich & producer Dean Devlin bases itself on the idea that an alien visited Earth & formed our society & Egypt is a reflection of those aliens, it's a reasonable idea although since the alien planet looks like a desert with Egyptian Pyramids & human beings as it's inhabitants it sometimes feels like Stargate is set on Earth rather than some distant planet on the edge of the known Universe. The story starts off intriguing enough & it's a very watchable & overall enjoyable film but at two hours in length it does drag at times & I wasn't keen on the rebellious slave uprising at the end, it just felt rather clichéd & predictable. The character's are alright & it's refreshing to see an alien planet where the aliens don't speak English, while this maybe authentic you can see why most sci-fi films don't go down this route since lots of alien dialogue without knowing what they are saying does tend to get a bit tedious, I certainly wouldn't want to watch many films where half the dialogue spoken is quite literally alien although having said that towards the end the dialogue starts to be subtitled.Director Emmerich is no stranger to the big budget special effects laden blockbuster & would go on to make films such as Independence Day (1992), Godzilla (1998) & The Day After Tomrrow (2004). Stargate was his second 'big' film after the rather good Jean-Claude Van Damme action sci-fi film Universal Solider (1992), Stargate certainly looks nice enough from the bright sunshine of the desert planet to the dark grey interiors of the evil aliens spaceship. The special effects are generally very good, made before a time CGI computer effects were used for everything Stargate has a mixture of CGI, model work & on set effects which all blend together to make for a convincing alien world. The huge Pyramid spaceship in particular looks very impressive. Apparently conceived by Emmerich during film school in 1979 both he & Devlin were sued by someone who alleged they stole the story from him, the case was settled out of court.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Stargate was a well funded film & it show's with a real sense of scope & scale, it also has that polished Hollywood feel although the scene at the end where Daniel & the girl are transported back down into the Pyramid is very poorly edited & it is actually quite difficult to make out what's happening. Apparently filmed in California & Arizona. The acting is good, I have always liked Kurt Russell but don't consider this to be one of his best films as he gives a largely cold & detached performance & only really becomes the action hero for the last fifteen minutes while Spader is likable enough as the geeky hero.Stargate is a good solid sci-fi film that doesn't quite reach the heights of greatness due to it's length, a lot of pointless dialogue scenes with aliens who you can't understand & I didn't really like the constant bland desert setting that much. Followed by the popular American Canadian TV series Stargate SG-1 (1997 - 2007) which ran for ten seasons & two hundred & thirteen episodes which itself spawned another TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004) which is still running now & the less than popular Stargate: Infinity (2002) which ran for a single solitary season.

The movie was initially interesting and well done. Once the violence started, it turned into generic Hollywood mass shooting nonsense. A wasted opportunity, as the premise of the story was good.

I loved this movie. It captured my attention quickly and kept it throughout the movie. It's a great ensamble cast and the special effects add to the movie's appeal, rather than BEING the appeal. The premise is engaging, and gives some very plausible explainations for mysteries that have stumped man for thousands of years. The bad guys are just as engagine as the good guys and that makes the movie all that much more enjoyable.I would give this movie an 8 out of 10. It's not perfect, but good for a very enjoyable movie night!

Stargate is, as far as I'm concerned, better than the original TV series, which I've watched a couple of time without really getting interested, but then I'm not a fan.The good. Very imaginative settings and alien technology. Beautiful photography. Nicely paced scenario. Interesting story with a solid background.The actors. Kurt Russell is right in his element, and didn't need to show the limits of his short acting range. James Spader is the most interesting character, and plays it well. Mili Avital is pretty, innocent, and plays her sweet role really nicely. Erick Avari, though, is my favorite of the cast and offers us a very convincing performance as the primitive priest-leader faced with powerful strangers. And finally, you can see some of the antics of French Stewart.The bad. Very low army credibility. The intro village miniature is of poor quality. The special effects are getting a bit old, but they were done in such a way as to minimize the aging and still be well received these days.The ugly. That desert beast puppet is just terrible. The chevrons are flimsy.The result. Good entertainment, recommended to sci-fi fans.

The rare Roland Emmerich film that isn't brainless, effects-over-story mayhem. Well, not completely, anyway. It does carry a lot of the director's favorite themes, from the tortured genius who only needs the chance to prove himself to the war-hungry soldier on a suicide mission, the overbearing government suits and the eccentric, ignored true believers. Those over-simplifications are glaring, of course, but at least there's an effort put in to expand certain characters beyond their stereotype (Kurt Russell's lingering resentment of guns, for example) and the plot itself is rich and interesting enough to paper over most of the holes. I've always had an affinity for science fiction and Egyptian history, so any merger of the two was bound to hit a sweet spot for me, and in this case the marriage works shockingly well. There's a certain other-worldliness about the pyramids, and that particular culture's system of beliefs, which lends itself well to such genre-driven filmmaking. The practical special effects come off wonderfully - gigantic hovering spacecraft and robotic Anubis-helmed enforcers - but it was still a bit early to rely on CG for this type of work and the few instances where they tried don't hold up very well. Despite a phoned-in leading performance by James Spader, Stargate remains a quirky, unexpectedly engaging ride. Still fresh, unique and interesting as it approaches its twenty-fifth anniversary.

The movie that started the whole Stargate franchise, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe. The story is very intriguing and the whole ring concept introduced is extremely fascinating. Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) and Daniel Jackson (James Spader) as the two leads work really fine together. Th effects might not live up to today's standard but much better than other 90s movie and the concept and this whole idea behind the Stargate is interested and explored more deeply in the shows.The villain Ra (Jaye Davidson) also show a lot of promise early in the movie but unfortunately he can't live up to promise and was kind of an lackluster villain in the end. The villain is of course not the center piece in this movie, that is of course the Stargate and their journey to Abydos. On Abydos they meet Skaara, Sha'uri and Kasuf, these character has to band together and fight against both time and Ra. The movie isn't fantastic by no means but it's a great starting point for the three series that continue after the movie.Roland Emmerich is not a great director but somehow he didn't screw this one up, sure the first Independence Day is also fine but his other movies have been mediocre at best. David Arnold's score in this movie is very well done and really should be appreciated. It's not the typical sci-fi, action movie you have grown to expect over the year, but Stargate actually has a few layers to it. The whole relationship that both Jack and Daniel make with the inhabitants on Abydos is compelling and adds a lot of emotional impact to the story. Overall a really solid movie that launched the Stargate franchise.Score: 6/10 (Solid)www.filmtvnow.wordpress.com

"Stargate"'s an exciting, high concept science fiction film from Roland ("Independence Day") Emmerich. With a capable cast, solid script and excellent set design, this is a big-budget adventure for viewers looking for pure escapist fun.The ever reliable Kurt Russell plays the square-jawed, world weary Jack O'Neil, who is responsible for leading the military mission to another world. James Spader plays the brilliant archaeologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson. At the time, this was a different type of role for Spader and he handles the humorous content of his scenes with great success.There's also an appearance by "The Crying Game"'s Jaye Davidson as the evil baddie, Ra. Although Davidson's role is quite small, he brings an other-worldly presence to his part.The score by David Arnold is excellent.A great idea for a movie, I can't help but think the concept would have made a successful television series...

Science fiction meets mythological history meets action and adventure. This is the better movie to come from Roland Emmerich's directional heritage, with the Lazarus theme running through Universal Soldier (1992), and the portly extravagance of Independence Day (1996), to the average sized Godzilla (1998), and to the sublime 2004 movie that centres on Earth's final days The Day After Tomorrow.Where The Day After Tomorrow concentrates on the Earths future demise, Stargate on the other hand goes further back, some 10,000 years back, into Egyptian myth and legend, and their cover-up of an alien being that once came to this planet to take its inhabitants for slaves, not by means of ships, but by the use of teleportation. The method of travelling to the ends of the universe, instantly, a quantum leap, from one space to another, as simply walking from one room into another, this is the evil purpose of the Stargate, a tool to transport humans across the galaxy, toward a life of slavery and death.Now, in the present day, and for eons past, the Stargate has been hidden, forgotten, and buried, as time has progressed and histories have come and gone throughout the ages; the Stargate has once more been unearthed. In the hands of the military, this portal, this unique tool, this mysterious device shall once more regenerate and transport those to new and wondrous worlds, those who now share its secret. Led by Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell), he, his team and Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spade), scientist and Egyptologist, have crossed the boundaries of time and space. These modern-day voyagers' have naively stumbled across the Kingdom of the ancient god Ra. An intelligent, cunning and malevolent aging creature that for centuries has explored the universe, exploiting all he grasps, using the bodies of his people, his slaves, his humans, to regenerate himself over and over to receive eternal life. And so the conflict between Man and the deadly demigod Ra begins, the Stargate is where it began, and with the Stargate, it shall end.Stargate is an interesting flavour of visual delight. Karl Walter Lindenlaub's cinematography and visual effects of the vast deserts and tribal communities that populate this three-mooned planet has us in a sweat quicker than a turkey at Thanksgiving. With a hint of arousal, a touch of depth, and a little pinch of tone and meaningful tenderness, Stargate, at the hands of Walter Lindenlaub has this movie cooked at exactly the correct temperament and texture that many first class cinemas would care to serve. While Stargate wins outright in the visual sense, what lets it down, a little, is its somewhat two-dimensional characters, they seem more reinvented parodies of this sci-fi genre than newcomers to this new world of adventure, the all American war hero, with his cool and impenetrable demeanour, even down to the most ridiculous haircut ever seen. The inexcusable government scientists that insist on wearing wool sweaters that even a charity shop would have trouble selling. Plus their seemingly inept competence at solving simple equations over a three-year period, that has Dr. Daniel Jackson solving within three weeks of his arrival, just a tiny clichéd, but not that important, and not too distracting either, to the narrative.English composer David Arnold, whose work on Casino Royale (2006), Hot Fuzz (2007), the "Little Britain" British television comedy series and the "Stargate SG-1" American T.V. series to name a few, does bring Stargate out of the dark and with it a shining example in what can be an uplifting, exciting and rewarding companion to Walter Lindenlaub vision. Any wonder then that these two professionals, including Stargate's director, have also worked on numerous projects together beforehand.Stargate, the 1994 original movie, has in perspective, been a huge success, not just because of its thrill ride at the worlds cinemas. Here, we have many T.V. spin-off's Stargate SG-1, Stargate: Atlantis, Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods, Stargate Atlantis: Rising etc, etc, some T.V. shows even producing spin-off's themselves. This is classic Saturday morning T.V. sci-fi fodder, as in the styles of nineteen fifties sci-fi, such as Captain Video and His Video Rangers, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. To bring it further up the evolutional ladder, the nineteen sixties gave us Doctor Who and Star Trek. Now, as we enter the new millennium, Stargate and its offspring are entertaining us in front of our television sets. An easygoing default movie that really does contain great visuals and a real sense of adventure that even the children of nineteen fifties and sixties television would not disagree.Sci-Fi is universal as it transcends across the barriers of time for each new generation, that is why Stargate will, and has, lead the way for the next generation.

Taking a leaf from Indiana Jones where someone will one day presumably dig up the Ark Of The Covenant out of storage and see how it works, in the inscrutable ways of the Washington bureaucracy, somebody in the Defense Department has taken an interest in something called Stargate and now want to see how it works. The somebody they sent for is archaeologist/linguist James Spader who deciphers some ancient Egyptian writing and poof, the gate is upright and operational.At that point the military takes over led by a hardnosed professional played by Kurt Russell. He's going through that gate with a team of special forces and with James Spader presumably so they can communicate with whatever life is out there.Stargate is a teleportation device and the team travels through time and space and ends up across the galaxy on a primitive planet where the people worship a being called Ra played by Jaye Davidson. He and his much technologically advanced confederates enslave the rest of the population.To see the changes the earth expedition makes and what the connection of this being to the Egyptian sun god Ra you will have to see this very well made and exciting science fiction film, one of the best films made during the Nineties. I saw it in theater when it first came out and seeing it again on the small screen still excites and entertains me. It's one of those films that with repeated viewing you get still another perspective.I liked best the interplay with Kurt Russell and James Spader. Two very opposite men in temperament and in training over the course of the film gradually gain a great respect for each other. Both deliver performances that would rank in the top five for both these players.One of the ways that Ra keeps his people subjugated is the forbidding of any of the nomadic types that are under his thumb to learn to write or even create a written language. In that culture and in every culture, literacy is the strongest weapon against tyranny. In fact one of the characters makes quite a sacrifice to secure the permanence of the revolution they've wrought on this world in another part of the galaxy that has a strange connection to our Earth. Stargate succeeds at being both thinking person's science fiction and also has enough action and adventure to keep you to the edge of your seat, especially in the second half. It's not to be missed when broadcast, ever.

What grabbed me about this movie was the potential it had. There was just so much that could be done with this dynamite idea. That alone made this an essential part of my movie collection.The movie itself is quite average and while worth seeing, isn't going to knock your socks off. The acting is from adequate to good; the effects were well done and quite nicely not overdone.So it's a fantastic idea that wasn't ruined, but isn't spectacular. The actors carry themselves well and this is a worthy addition to any sci-fi collection (especially those who like the idea of alternate history for mankind - See Alien vs. Predator).I normally don't write such quick reviews, but this is what I felt about the movie and I think that much more would give away too much for those who haven't seen it.

Stargate is a terrific movie that has produced 2 hit TV shows, conventions and fans from all over the world. This movie started it all. I found it in my Uncle's basement and decided to watch it. It has an interesting storyline tying in Ancient Egyptian Mythology to make it even more interesting. It's about a struggling archaeologist with strange ideas about the gods and rulers of Ancient Egypt. Only one person is willing to believe him, and recruits him for a translator. What they find is even more amazing than they expected.It's a highly underrated movie, in my opinion it's better than most sci-fi movies and very interesting.

Stargate's plot, acting, and score all contribute beautifully to the mysterious ambiance that is the essence of this enthralling and suspenseful film.  While your disbelief definitely needs to be suspended to cover some inconsistencies, the atmosphere and action of the movie make it worth your while.  Not only does Stargate combine science fiction with history, but it weaves them together in a way that remains exciting the entire film, despite major changes of environment.  Upon hearing some major elements of the film, one might think that aliens, ancient Egypt, and atomic bombs could only come together in some kind of bizarre montage.  However, this film is strongly plot-driven, and while this does make it typical in some respects, the plot itself is remarkable.  Hardly artsy, the score is in many places Hollywood-ish, presenting emotion in a straightforward manner, yet it too is enjoyable.  None of the acting is spectacular, but this is made up for by the characters' wholesome qualities and ability to change (however slightly) over the course of the movie.  To summarize, while nothing in the film is a complete divergence from the standard, it follows the Hollywood style in a manner that is original enough to make a solid and enjoyable adventure. This is the actualization of the potential within the Hollywood film "template": a good story told well in all respects. [9/10]

When I first saw Stargate in 1996 I thought it was a great movie. It had plenty of action, excitement and special effects but also a brilliant story.James Spader does a wonderful job as Daniel Jackson and ditto for Kurt Russell as Colonel Jack O' Neill. The villains in the movie are very interesting and were a refreshing change to those we usually encounter in movies.This film would probably be of great interest to those interested in Egyptology or anything to do with the ancient world. It is a thought provoking film for fans of ancient history.All in all, a great movie which spawned an equally great TV series three years later.

When scientists and historians finally figure out the meaning of an ancient Egyptian artifact, it opens a portal to another planet.Stargate was panned by the critics on its release, no A list stars they cried, a plot line that bore a resemblance to a 1970 film called Erinnerungen an die Zukunft, and apparently caught between being an adult picture and a child friendly blockbuster. Those critics were forced to eat their words as Stargate promptly went on to be a monster smash, making $196,567,262 worldwide, and spawning a hugely popular TV series. It is for sure a no brain popcorn piece, suspension of disbelief should be at the forefront of any prospective first time viewer, but it's great fun and snazzy in all its set piece work.Led by square jawed Kurt Russell as an on the edge Colonel, our band of merry men adventurers face peril in their new world via the weather, language barriers with the locals, oh and something a touch more sinister!. James Spader does an impressive turn as a geeky Egyptologist, on who's fate the groups survival may well rest, while Jaye Davidson serves a reminder that yes, he did act in movies many years ago. It's cliché ridden, and most of it is hacked together from far better pictures in the genres that Stargate wants to emulate, but it's damn entertaining and looks fabulous in High Definition. 7/10

For the 90s this is a decent scifi film, the characters were well cast and the storyline was interesting. The effects and costuming are pretty good. Russel and Spader make for unlikely duo, but they kind off work.

The movie tells how an Egyptologist named Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is hired to figure out a weird enigma contained into an underground military base . He decodes Egyptian hieroglyphic and opens the gate for transporting to a distant planet by means of a mechanism called Stargate . Daniel alongside Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russel) and US troops (John Diehl , French Stewart , among others) realize a quantum leap and travel across a fantastic universe . Arriving in a distant planet encounter an ancient culture ruled by Good Father (Eric Avari) and with naive inhabitants (Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital) . Everybody is dominated by an immortal being named Ra (Jaye Davidson) and his underlings , Horus(Dijimon Honsou) and Anubis (Carlos Lauchu) . The good guys must save earth from the deadly atomic bomb that evil leader wants to explode .This exciting sci-fi movie that was number one in the US box-office , displays spectacular scenarios , adventures , noisy action and is pretty entertaining . This is a blending into universe legends , fantastic myths , astounding science-fiction and Egyptian Gods , including Ra , Horus and Anubis . The movie packs stunning array of technical visuals and amazing sequences . Furthermore , a beautifully executed set design with phenomenal production values . Enjoyable cinematography by Karl Walter Linderlaub and sensational soundtrack by David Arnold . The picture with an interesting script by Dean Devlin , is well directed by Roland Emmerich .It's followed by an overlong series starred and produced by Richard Dean Anderson and a spin-off titled Stargate Atlantis . The motion picture will appeal to TV saga enthusiasts as well as the neophyte who didn't have seen the episodes . It's indispensable and fundamental seeing for Sci-Fi buffs .

I don't understand why this movie is so underrated. I have seen it multiple times, and each time I get something new from it. It is a beautiful work of art (The Director's Cut is also a must-see, because the added scenes elaborate on a few confusing plot points) Now, I would just like to take a moment and talk about the aspects of Stargate that make it an enjoyable, exciting, riveting, and thought-provoking film.First of all, David Arnold has to be recognized for his masterful soundtrack. He should have won some kind of award, like Hans Zimmer won for Gladiator. David Arnold combines themes of romance, adventure, and wonder the likes of which I have never heard. (And believe me, I am an avid fan of movie music, especially Sci-Fi) I am even brave enough to say that his music in Stargate rivals classic, celebrated soundtracks such as Star Wars (John Williams) Next time you see the movie, pay as much attention to David Arnold's music as you pay to the plot. The opening titles themselves are reason enough to rush to the store immediately and buy the soundtrack. My favorite sequence of the soundtrack, by the way, is (#21 Myth, Faith, and Belief) In the movie, this is the scene where Daniel (James Spader) talks to Ra (Jaye Davidson) It is the scene right before the one where Daniel is *almost* forced to kill the soldiers, including Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) that he arrived with.Second of all, this is a VERY believable science fiction film. Most films (like Star Wars, Star Trek, and more) don't have very many ways in which they can actually tie-in with reality. Stargate is in itself a theory. It asks: Where did the pyramids come from? How did the Egyptians develop their gods, and how were they influenced? The answer given by the film to these questions is entirely feasible. Even though the gate itself isn't easy to accept, the underlying theme to the movie is. (pay very very close attention to Daniel and the "seminar" he gives about 10 minutes into the movie in front of other scientists)Third, and last, I would like to tip the hat to Jaye Davidson's performance. His portrayal of Ra is chilling.(although some people don't seem to agree) Just hearing him speak and seeing his eyes glow sends shivers up my spine. He makes a perfect villain, and it is truly a shame that he hasn't been in many other movies.This movie receives from me an easy 9 out of 10. It would have gotten a 10 if it were not for the horrible lack of character development. Jack O'Neill is especially bland, although he does seem to brighten up a little bit in the last scene.
See the movie! Buy the soundtrack! And I hope you liked my comments!

Not many people know this yet, but I'm writing the next Emmerich film. Yes. It's going to have a lead who's a dorky, socially awkward, extremely smart yet ignored scientist of some field that will relate to the plot, which will be something big, requiring a lot of costumed extras and loud special effects, and be set or deal with something fantastic that isn't that closely linked to reality. Seriously though, for using the same basic formula, his flicks tend to be fun and enjoyable escapism. Plus, this marks the possibly unique occasion of James Spader not(!) playing the role of a sexual deviant in the movie he's in. I guess he wanted to branch out. Russell, as expected, nails his part as the hardened military man who does have a heart, and in general the acting is great. The story is interesting enough, and it develops fine throughout. Pacing is good, and this does notably not overwhelm or overstimulate the audience, in spite of presenting a world that we can't directly relate to. Stephen Sommers, are you paying attention? The FX are excellent. This is exciting, entertaining and cool. The action is awesome and not excessive. As for music, this uses a broad, sweeping score, and that works well. The humor is reasonable, the jokes and gags are hit and miss. There is infrequent mild to moderately strong language and a little violence and one or two hints towards sexuality in this. I recommend this to any and all fans of those who made it, particularly Roland. 7/10

First, I do have to feel sorry for the people who considered Stargate "typical" or "old fashioned". Makes me wonder what kinds of lives they lead.Stargate didn't have a major book to emulate, it is pure imagination...and some darned good imagination at that. Emerich and crew created not only a new world for us, they created a whole new Universe that spawned one of the most successful series ever...it does not get much better than that my friends...The story itself is straight forward scifi, with little bits of background stories woven in to keep the flavor interesting...a few might call it fairly slow moving, and frankly it is, but I think they had to do that to tell the whole story...I liked it just the way it was produced, and became an avid fan of the series that followed...Yup, it is a classic movie, by anyone's standards...

I first saw STARGATE about seven years ago and left with memories of thinking that it was in some way an old fashioned movie . I couldn't put my finger on why I thought this was an old fashioned movie but after seeing it again tonight I can perhaps explain it better now STARGATE isn't so much as " old fashioned " , it's just got a rather old type of plot that's versatile . It's almost like a Tarzan movie from the 1940s where a bunch of good white guys ( In movies in those days bad guys were usually white - The good guys were always white ) team up with the king of the jungle in order to fight a bunch of evil slave traders . The story could easily be reworked with a bunch of 18th century good guys led by Errol Flynn getting shipwrecked on an island where they meet noble natives and defend them from evil pirates . Rewatching this movie again after a gap of several years I often forgot that I was watching a far fetched SF blockbuster and thought I was watching a historical drama , something that's not to be taken as a criticism . I also became aware of subtle plot points that I'd missed on first viewing . For example I thought the death of O'Neil's son was so underdeveloped that it was totally unnecessary to include this in the movie but there's a couple of scenes where it is important to the plot later on . I also knew that the movie wasn't going to be an ALIENS type of movie , something the original trailers confused me about . let's face it , a special forces team creeping about a dark pyramid . It's got be similar in tone to ALIENS . If that's what you think STARGATE is going to be about you'll be as disappointed as I was first time I saw itOf the cast Kurt Russell and his special forces group are slightly wooden but I won't criticise the cast since these type of characters always lack flair in these genre movies . James Spader is slightly unconvincing as hero Dan Jackson due to wimpish nature and effette hairstyle ( Was Jackson conceived as a female character ? ) but Jaye Davidson is absolutely superb as Ra . This is the same Jaye Davidson from THE CRYING GAME and I was totally shocked to find this was the second and last feature film he appeared in . According to the trivia section of STARGATE it appears he's difficult to work with but someone cast him in more movies pleaseAs for the Roland Emmerich / Dean Devlin partnership there are a few faults . One is the opening of the script that contains no hook and fools the audience into thinking they'll be watching a RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK type movie which they won't be . The script also contains a few unlikely plot holes such as the special forces team taking some GPS equipment with them something that wouldn't work on a planet where humanity had never been , and also discovering in an unlikely scenario that they won't be able to return to Earth thanks to Jackson . There is a very interesting point to the subtext however and that is that if there is a god it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be benign or good . Food for thought . Thankfully Emmerich doesn't go overboard on the CGI while he also had the good sense ( Say it again ) to cast Jaye Davidson as RaBy no means a classic SF movie STARGATE is solid entertainment and is rather more enjoyable on second viewing

In 1928, in Egypt, a strange device is found by an expedition. In the present days, the outcast linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is invited by a mysterious woman to decipher an ancient hieroglyph in a military facility. Soon he finds that the device was developed by an advanced civilization and opens a portal to teletransport to another planet. Dr. Jackson is invited to join a military team under the command of Colonel Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell) that will explore the new world. They find a land that recalls Egypt and humans in a primitive culture that worship and are slaves to Ra, the God of the Sun. But soon they discover the secret of the mysterious "stargate". "Stargate" is still a fantastic sci-fi after almost twenty years and watching it at least six times. The story is intriguing and entwines action with humor and romance. The cast is excellent, with Kurt Russell and James Spade in the top of their careers. The special effects are still great after almost twenty years. And the haunting music score completes this timeless classic sci-fi with a touch of class. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Stargate - A Chave para o Futuro da Humanidade" ("Stargate – The Key for the Future of Mankind")Note: On 18 May 2017, I saw this film again.

Stargate starts in 1928 in Giza where an archaeological dig uncovers an alien Stargate used to travel between worlds. Jump forward to the 'Present Day' where Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has radical theories that the Pyramids weren't constructed by the Egyptians, he is contacted by Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) & given the opportunity to prove his theories. Langford takes Jackson to an underground Military facility where no-one has been able to work out how to operate the mysterious Stargate, within a couple of weeks Jackson has it all figured out. A mission is undertaken to travel through the Stargate to a distant planet & investigate the alien world on the other side...This French American co-production was co-written & directed by Roland Emmerich & is a fine sci-fi adventure film that holds up very well even when viewed today nearly fifteen years after it was made which is a feat in itself since a lot of sci-fi dates badly very quickly. Originally the rough cut for Stargate was apparently three hours long, it was eventually released into theatres at two hours long & has subsequently been released in a 'Director's Cut' that adds about ten more minutes to the theatrical cut, having said that I will be basing my comments on the original two hour theatrical version. The script by Emmerich & producer Dean Devlin bases itself on the idea that an alien visited Earth & formed our society & Egypt is a reflection of those aliens, it's a reasonable idea although since the alien planet looks like a desert with Egyptian Pyramids & human beings as it's inhabitants it sometimes feels like Stargate is set on Earth rather than some distant planet on the edge of the known Universe. The story starts off intriguing enough & it's a very watchable & overall enjoyable film but at two hours in length it does drag at times & I wasn't keen on the rebellious slave uprising at the end, it just felt rather clichéd & predictable. The character's are alright & it's refreshing to see an alien planet where the aliens don't speak English, while this maybe authentic you can see why most sci-fi films don't go down this route since lots of alien dialogue without knowing what they are saying does tend to get a bit tedious, I certainly wouldn't want to watch many films where half the dialogue spoken is quite literally alien although having said that towards the end the dialogue starts to be subtitled.Director Emmerich is no stranger to the big budget special effects laden blockbuster & would go on to make films such as Independence Day (1992), Godzilla (1998) & The Day After Tomrrow (2004). Stargate was his second 'big' film after the rather good Jean-Claude Van Damme action sci-fi film Universal Solider (1992), Stargate certainly looks nice enough from the bright sunshine of the desert planet to the dark grey interiors of the evil aliens spaceship. The special effects are generally very good, made before a time CGI computer effects were used for everything Stargate has a mixture of CGI, model work & on set effects which all blend together to make for a convincing alien world. The huge Pyramid spaceship in particular looks very impressive. Apparently conceived by Emmerich during film school in 1979 both he & Devlin were sued by someone who alleged they stole the story from him, the case was settled out of court.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Stargate was a well funded film & it show's with a real sense of scope & scale, it also has that polished Hollywood feel although the scene at the end where Daniel & the girl are transported back down into the Pyramid is very poorly edited & it is actually quite difficult to make out what's happening. Apparently filmed in California & Arizona. The acting is good, I have always liked Kurt Russell but don't consider this to be one of his best films as he gives a largely cold & detached performance & only really becomes the action hero for the last fifteen minutes while Spader is likable enough as the geeky hero.Stargate is a good solid sci-fi film that doesn't quite reach the heights of greatness due to it's length, a lot of pointless dialogue scenes with aliens who you can't understand & I didn't really like the constant bland desert setting that much. Followed by the popular American Canadian TV series Stargate SG-1 (1997 - 2007) which ran for ten seasons & two hundred & thirteen episodes which itself spawned another TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004) which is still running now & the less than popular Stargate: Infinity (2002) which ran for a single solitary season.

The movie was initially interesting and well done. Once the violence started, it turned into generic Hollywood mass shooting nonsense. A wasted opportunity, as the premise of the story was good.

I loved this movie. It captured my attention quickly and kept it throughout the movie. It's a great ensamble cast and the special effects add to the movie's appeal, rather than BEING the appeal. The premise is engaging, and gives some very plausible explainations for mysteries that have stumped man for thousands of years. The bad guys are just as engagine as the good guys and that makes the movie all that much more enjoyable.I would give this movie an 8 out of 10. It's not perfect, but good for a very enjoyable movie night!

Stargate is, as far as I'm concerned, better than the original TV series, which I've watched a couple of time without really getting interested, but then I'm not a fan.The good. Very imaginative settings and alien technology. Beautiful photography. Nicely paced scenario. Interesting story with a solid background.The actors. Kurt Russell is right in his element, and didn't need to show the limits of his short acting range. James Spader is the most interesting character, and plays it well. Mili Avital is pretty, innocent, and plays her sweet role really nicely. Erick Avari, though, is my favorite of the cast and offers us a very convincing performance as the primitive priest-leader faced with powerful strangers. And finally, you can see some of the antics of French Stewart.The bad. Very low army credibility. The intro village miniature is of poor quality. The special effects are getting a bit old, but they were done in such a way as to minimize the aging and still be well received these days.The ugly. That desert beast puppet is just terrible. The chevrons are flimsy.The result. Good entertainment, recommended to sci-fi fans.

The rare Roland Emmerich film that isn't brainless, effects-over-story mayhem. Well, not completely, anyway. It does carry a lot of the director's favorite themes, from the tortured genius who only needs the chance to prove himself to the war-hungry soldier on a suicide mission, the overbearing government suits and the eccentric, ignored true believers. Those over-simplifications are glaring, of course, but at least there's an effort put in to expand certain characters beyond their stereotype (Kurt Russell's lingering resentment of guns, for example) and the plot itself is rich and interesting enough to paper over most of the holes. I've always had an affinity for science fiction and Egyptian history, so any merger of the two was bound to hit a sweet spot for me, and in this case the marriage works shockingly well. There's a certain other-worldliness about the pyramids, and that particular culture's system of beliefs, which lends itself well to such genre-driven filmmaking. The practical special effects come off wonderfully - gigantic hovering spacecraft and robotic Anubis-helmed enforcers - but it was still a bit early to rely on CG for this type of work and the few instances where they tried don't hold up very well. Despite a phoned-in leading performance by James Spader, Stargate remains a quirky, unexpectedly engaging ride. Still fresh, unique and interesting as it approaches its twenty-fifth anniversary.

The movie that started the whole Stargate franchise, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe. The story is very intriguing and the whole ring concept introduced is extremely fascinating. Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) and Daniel Jackson (James Spader) as the two leads work really fine together. Th effects might not live up to today's standard but much better than other 90s movie and the concept and this whole idea behind the Stargate is interested and explored more deeply in the shows.The villain Ra (Jaye Davidson) also show a lot of promise early in the movie but unfortunately he can't live up to promise and was kind of an lackluster villain in the end. The villain is of course not the center piece in this movie, that is of course the Stargate and their journey to Abydos. On Abydos they meet Skaara, Sha'uri and Kasuf, these character has to band together and fight against both time and Ra. The movie isn't fantastic by no means but it's a great starting point for the three series that continue after the movie.Roland Emmerich is not a great director but somehow he didn't screw this one up, sure the first Independence Day is also fine but his other movies have been mediocre at best. David Arnold's score in this movie is very well done and really should be appreciated. It's not the typical sci-fi, action movie you have grown to expect over the year, but Stargate actually has a few layers to it. The whole relationship that both Jack and Daniel make with the inhabitants on Abydos is compelling and adds a lot of emotional impact to the story. Overall a really solid movie that launched the Stargate franchise.Score: 6/10 (Solid)www.filmtvnow.wordpress.com

Stargate is one of those great movies that hasn't got the respect it deserves. At first I thought the movie was about time travel since they go to a place that is like Ancient Egypt, which didn't really interest me at all. Then I caught an episode of the T.V. show and got curious. When I saw the movie I was blown away. The special effects were ones I had never really seen before (such as opening the Stargate for the first time). I was getting tired of seeing sci-fi movies where every alien race spoke perfect English and I thought I would experience that until the team met with the villagers which I thought was better. It's always cool to see Kurt Russel kicking ass in films. It was also different to see James Spader play the semi-nerdy guy instead of the asshole he mainly plays. I was also amazed when Roland Emmerich chose one of the simplest villains for a movie, an ancient Egyptian god. I watch this movie every week and I never get tired of it.

I had never seen Stargate before 2020 the TV show or this movie but as a bit of a science fiction nerd I thought it was time I gave it a watch and I honestly wasn't disappointed with it the movie is quite unique and has a storyline that kept my interest and was pretty original for it's time.Stargate takes place in 1994 when linguist and Egyptian professor Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is payed a visit by an archaeologist who in 1928 when she was just a young girl was there when an ancient Egyptian artifact thought to be a device of some kind and stone tablets inscribed with an ancient Egyptian language were discovered during a dig by the Egyptian pyramids she invites him to study the artifact in a top secret base in the hopes he is able to decipher the inscriptions and find out how to use the device he successfully powers the device up which they find out is actually a portal to another point in space a planet similar to earth across a distant galaxy so he and Army Col. Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) along with some soldiers cross the portal to discover what lies on the other side there they find a primitive civilization who speak a long dead Egyptian language and worship the sun god RA who created the Stargate between the two planets and established a mining colony between both worlds using humans as slaves on both worlds until an uprising on earth dethroned him and branded him a false god tearing down the Stargate between the two worlds Jackson soon discovers RA is actually an alien who traveled across space to find a way to cheat death RA discovered earth and humankind and using a human body as a host he can live forever as the god RA by regenerating the host body so he never age's and dies but Jackson and O'Neil reveal to the slaves that there god is flesh and blood and they can overthrow him starting a rebellion against him that ends in his ultimate defeat Jackson stays behind with the humans on the strange planet with his love interest to create a new civilisation free of slavery while O'Neil and the remaining soldiers travel back to earth via the Stargate and destroy it on there side to protect earth from any possible other Stargates out there.The story is well written and the movie takes it's time building up the anticipation of what's on the other side of the Stargate then takes it time exploring the other side and it's environment rather than just doing what most science fiction movie's do and rush into the action it's a nice change of pace then when the movie's action scenes do start up it feels well placed and part of the story not just shoved in to spice the movie up a bit.I recommend this movie to any science fiction movie fan it's the story and visuals that are the main theme in this movie a lot like Star Trek it focuses on the intellectual side of science fiction and not just the action very enjoyable to watch if your a science fiction nerd like myself.Just a side note I purchased the Directors Cut Special Edition on Blu Ray released in 2008 and it has no language options or subtitle options not a huge deal for most but is an issue if you suffer from deafness or are hard of hearing.

"Stargate"'s an exciting, high concept science fiction film from Roland ("Independence Day") Emmerich. With a capable cast, solid script and excellent set design, this is a big-budget adventure for viewers looking for pure escapist fun.The ever reliable Kurt Russell plays the square-jawed, world weary Jack O'Neil, who is responsible for leading the military mission to another world. James Spader plays the brilliant archaeologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson. At the time, this was a different type of role for Spader and he handles the humorous content of his scenes with great success.There's also an appearance by "The Crying Game"'s Jaye Davidson as the evil baddie, Ra. Although Davidson's role is quite small, he brings an other-worldly presence to his part.The score by David Arnold is excellent.A great idea for a movie, I can't help but think the concept would have made a successful television series...

An entertaining Sci-fi with plenty to keep one's attention.The story is good but not too original.A predictable ending.Some good special effects and plenty of extra used in some of the scenes.The acting was not the best but ok.

Taking a leaf from Indiana Jones where someone will one day presumably dig up the Ark Of The Covenant out of storage and see how it works, in the inscrutable ways of the Washington bureaucracy, somebody in the Defense Department has taken an interest in something called Stargate and now want to see how it works. The somebody they sent for is archaeologist/linguist James Spader who deciphers some ancient Egyptian writing and poof, the gate is upright and operational.At that point the military takes over led by a hardnosed professional played by Kurt Russell. He's going through that gate with a team of special forces and with James Spader presumably so they can communicate with whatever life is out there.Stargate is a teleportation device and the team travels through time and space and ends up across the galaxy on a primitive planet where the people worship a being called Ra played by Jaye Davidson. He and his much technologically advanced confederates enslave the rest of the population.To see the changes the earth expedition makes and what the connection of this being to the Egyptian sun god Ra you will have to see this very well made and exciting science fiction film, one of the best films made during the Nineties. I saw it in theater when it first came out and seeing it again on the small screen still excites and entertains me. It's one of those films that with repeated viewing you get still another perspective.I liked best the interplay with Kurt Russell and James Spader. Two very opposite men in temperament and in training over the course of the film gradually gain a great respect for each other. Both deliver performances that would rank in the top five for both these players.One of the ways that Ra keeps his people subjugated is the forbidding of any of the nomadic types that are under his thumb to learn to write or even create a written language. In that culture and in every culture, literacy is the strongest weapon against tyranny. In fact one of the characters makes quite a sacrifice to secure the permanence of the revolution they've wrought on this world in another part of the galaxy that has a strange connection to our Earth. Stargate succeeds at being both thinking person's science fiction and also has enough action and adventure to keep you to the edge of your seat, especially in the second half. It's not to be missed when broadcast, ever.

"Stargate" the movie is one of those Saturday afternoon adventure movies you went to as a kid. It's not Shakespeare but it is entertaining. The original release had a few gaps in the plot (why send the bomb for example) which the slightly expanded video release corrects by restoring about 10 minutes of cuts. Well photographed and good effects."Stargate" the tv series is another story. While the film's premise was acceptable once the visit a new world a week series strains it. Production values are also a bit tacky

The first twenty minutes of this movie were extremely promising. Then the whole thing fell apart and seemed like a 'prequel' to 'Independence Day'. I would like to thank our Swedish contributor. I don't speak Swedish and thought that the language used was another 'made up' language that is used in 'alien' films. It's most annoying that these languages are always spoken in sharp, short bursts which have no flow. Why Swedish? If one is going to use an alien language, just make it up or find a language which is less-known. Viveca Lindfors was sadly wasted as were the other actors in the beginning of the film. They just disappeared. I would have much rather seen a movie about Lindfors life from the first discovery of the Stargate. I wonder if she was the Swedish coach? The premise was interesting but the behavior on the 'parallel' world was ridiculous. The cliches flew quick and fast. James Spaders falls in love with dusky native maiden. How many times has this 'instant cross cultural love' been used? What is really offensive about this plot device is that 99% of the time, it's always a white MALE who gets the 'native'.The other cliches were just as bad. When a problem can't be solved, the Americans 'get out the guns'. Guns solve everything. (I am an American.) Jaye Davidson was very good in 'The Crying Game', but his character in 'Stargate' was as weak as the plot and gave no sense of the immense power he was supposed to wield. James Spader was, in my opinion, playing the 'cliche' genius, with a lot of little 'absent-minded' mannerisms which were supposed to make him 'cute'. I didn't mind his hair. Kurt Russell was another cliche. The way to bring him back from a deep and suicidal depression was to send him out on a mission.Then he gets to kill a lot of people, which makes him feel much better. Something that the army would never risk.   In the process,he finds a surrogate son in the Bedouin boy.  Give us a break!
