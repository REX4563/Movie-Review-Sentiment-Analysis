Ginger Snaps is one of the best revisionist horror movies I've seen - if you liked "Ravenous" you'll enjoy this.  Contrary to a previous reviewer's remarks, the film is not heartlessly "cool" - no chilly hipster would be capable of the compassion this film shows to its outcast, unbeautiful characters.  Like all the best horror films, the true subject of fear is very real - the earthquake effect of sexual maturity on teenagers, girls in this case, and the disruption of sibling relationships by differing levels of sexual maturity.  It also speaks to a genuine post-Columbine concern. When youth culture admires alienation, morbid affectation and misanthropy, how can genuine psychosis be distinguished from acting out?  The highest praise goes to Isabelle and Perkins, whose characterisation is superb. Mimi Rogers as the mother who raises denial to an art form is also excellent.On the downside, the last twenty percent of the film declines into cliched stalk-and-slash, with typically idiotic behaviour by previously intelligent characters, and an embarrassingly polymeric monster.  The humanoid werewolf makeup is so derivative of "Buffy" I'm surprised Optic Nerve didn't sue. Moreover, for its revisionist pretensions, the films underlying attitudes to sexuality are disappointingly regressive, as are the final fates to which it consigns its characters.On balance though, highly recommended.

Grim horror story about two strange sisters--Brigette (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle). They're very close--too close! Their relationship got really creepy. Then Ginger is attacked by a werewolf and starts becoming one herself. Brigette wants to protect her and cure her, but then Ginger starts killing people...Dead serious horror film from Canada. Well made with tons of blood and gore...I'm surprised (and pleased) that this got an R rating. Cool werewolves too. This is an unusual horror film. There are no jokes, very little humor and the attack scenes are strong (this is NOT for weak stomaches) and there's an overall very depressing atmosphere. Also good acting by the entire cast, especially Perkins, Isabelle and Kris Lemche--a real cute guy who tries to help the girls. Strong stuff but a good film for horror fans especially.This was barely released theatrically in the US. It's well worth searching out in video or DVD.

Whoever marketed 'Ginger Snaps' should get some kind of award for sabotage! Looking at the packaging and it's name-dropping of 'The Craft'(??!) one would think you were in for your typical late 90s "ironic" MTV teen horror ala 'Scream' and the '..Last Summer' series, or some sort of 'Buffy' cash in. I nearly avoided watching it for exactly that reason. Am I glad I didn't! 'Ginger Snaps', while not totally perfect, is one of the freshest horror movies I've seen in ages, and one of the best werewolf movies of recent years. You can read the plot elsewhere so I won't bore you by repeating it. But I have to comment on the excellent script, with its realistic portrayal of teen life. No 90210/'Seventh Heaven' whitewash here! The teens act and talk like REAL PEOPLE, and the honesty about sex, drugs and puberty is rarely seen in contemporary movies, horror or otherwise.
I said not totally perfect because the climax was a let down. The last 20-25 minutes of the film lost its way a bit, and dragged in places. A bit more tightening up and a stronger ending could have made 'Ginger Snaps' a classic. As it is it's an original spin on an old concept, and highly recommended viewing!

Ginger Snaps is a low budget Canadian horror film that also has a subtext of growing up and puberty.Bridgette (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) are two sisters who are very close and have fascination about death. They stage and photograph death scenes and regarded as weird at High School where they are regarded as outcasts and suffer from bullying. Ginger is one year older than Bridgette and is starting her period rather late.Ginger gets attacked by a werewolf very close to her first period and her body undergoes changes. Hair, mood swings, pains, bleeding, sexualisation and a tail. You see the parallels to growing up and becoming a werewolf. Heck there is even a 28 day cycle!Of course as the blood lust takes effect Ginger gets more savage and starts to kill. This is after the guys at High School find her hot and appealing which means she has no trouble attracting victims. Its left to Bridgette and high school drug dealer Sam to find a cure for lycanthropy and save Ginger.There is nothing much original about a werewolf film. Writer Karen Walton has given this film a feminist twist and a lot of it is due to the bond between the two sisters and Bridgette wanting to save Ginger out of that love.Director John Fawcett goes for a more realistic portrayal of High School life and more honest representation of family relationships when children hit adolescent. Mimi Rogers plays the mother and although the father does not speak a lot when he does his remarks are rather waspish.The film suffers slightly from its low budget and it could been tighter. I think the climax loses its way a bit and should had been better presented.Its a rare combination of intellectual horror and dark comedy which works to an extent but never quiet pulls it off successfully.

Allegories are nothing new to the horror genre, or fiction in general, but oftentimes they're rather forced and/or unimaginative. There are of course some good examples, like X-Men, but often, especially in horror, it's painfully obvious what the allusion is meant to be and what the film makers want to say with it. It ain't exactly subtle, is what I'm saying. Which is why it's often better to not even attempt to be subtle and make the painfully obvious allegory slash symbolism work for you.Such is the case of Ginger Snaps. Two sisters, Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) are hilariously alternative teenagers. They're into goths, suicides, the colour purple and living in the most dungeon-like basement I've seen in a while. Yet it doesn't feel fake, but just the right amount of over the top. But everything takes a turn for the worse when one of them changes. Both into a woman and a werewolf. Suddenly she's all about blood and lust and mating and bitching at people, leaving her poor virginal sister behind. I said the allegory was painfully obvious, didn't I. But, it works because the film is honest about it. It plays it off as a joke, with tongue firmly in cheek, which turns a groan-worthy B-movie shlock into quite hilarious horror parody, which is still works as a straight horror film as well. Almost like Stephen King's Carrie meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer.It also helps that the two main leads are both fantastic. Isabelle is the more typical horror heroine with the looks and the lines, which makes her a great partner for Perkins, whose portrayal of a wallflower shut-in Brigitte is one of the better ones I've seen. She's shy and the oddball in school, but she has character and smarts to make her more than a stereotype.The movie's only real fault is the third act, which is rather predictable and clich√©d as far as monster horror movies go. There are some good twists, but it does drag quite badly and the ending is not worthy of the buildup. It's not really even all that awful, but it is disappointing when compared to the tone and promise of the two previous acts.Still, Ginger Snaps is a great movie to check out if you're into campy horror movies that know not to take themselves too seriously.

The first thing you need to know before you watch Ginger Snaps is that's a real horror movie. That means genuinely unsettling, disturbing, makes-your-skin-crawl kind of stuff. And you're plunged right into this from the start. The opening scene involves a mother and her young son discovering that the family dog has been torn to pieces, bloody scraps and guts all over the back yard ... which pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie.In a way it's not really that gratuitous. The whole movie is a metaphor for adolescence, which in itself is a pretty gruesome thing to have to go through. There are these two morbid sisters, Ginger and Bridgette, who are afraid of growing up so much that they have a suicide pact together. They are obsessed with death, and for art class they take photos of each other in disturbingly realistic fake death poses. Ginger begins going through puberty, has her first period, and whoosh! Cue the werewolf attack.The initial changes she goes through are pretty common -- mood swings, bleeding, pains, hairy legs, growing a tail ... okay, maybe that last one isn't quite so common. Bridgette, along with a drug dealer named Sam who accidentally hit the original werewolf with his van, begin to suspect what's really going on and start thinking of how they can cure the disease of lycanthropy. The idea of werewolves is introduced early on, and the characters accept it pretty quickly after the things they see which means we can just get on with the story.Karen Walton has written a fantastic script here, and John Fawcett proves himself a competent director. All of the leads are excellent in their roles, with the two lead actresses Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle expertly playing the disturbed Fitzgerald sisters with fantastic chemistry. Kris Lemche is also notable as the drug dealer, giving a performance reminiscent of Christian Slater's shining moment in "Heathers". In fact, the two movies are similar in tone in a number of ways, and both have become cult classics with very similar audiences. The special effects team, headed by Paul Jones who worked on such projects as "Dracula 2000" and "Wolf Girl", have also done a pretty good job, creating some great-looking physical effects, with blood and guts piling up in every passing minute. The design of the wolf itself is interesting and original, giving us something that we really haven't seen before.And so, though not for the faint of heart, this dark and wonderful piece of work ranks as probably the smartest, most subtle and intelligent werewolf movie ever made.

i thought it was anyway, because twilight spends too much time brainwashing and imbuing youth with crazy ideas. This is the way werewolf films should be done, concentrating on the werewolf stuff & not using it as an excuse to turn it into a romeo and juliet rip-off. anyone agree on the whole twilight thing? good film, good mix of humour and horror. i found brigette very annoying at first, but then she grew on me as the film goes on. good Friday night film!!! cant think of anything else to say to make this ten lines long, so i'll mention the giant weed farm in that kids greenhouse. wish i had one of those. " Wicked, smoke us up!"

A welcome change from the usual generic American offerings, this Canadian take on moody teens and the horrors of growing up has a laid-back, low-budget feel to it. The monster looks a bit plastic-y but the film is really about the sisters, and both roles are admirably filled by two capable but very different young starlets.Perkins is compelling as the awkward, introverted class nerd, and Isabelle magnificent as the slightly scary, sexy, ex-nerd who turns into a real man-eater. Together they share a fascination for bloody re-enactments of death, and their scenes together are outstanding - if you're not too squeamish.It's not really a scary horror, although it has it's moments. The performances from the entire cast are spot-on, and this makes it a very watchable film. Isabelle sizzles and Perkins fascinates, providing the icing on a tasty if unremarkable movie.

"Ginger Snaps" is a nice addition to the werewolf genre, especially because it is more than just a werewolf movie. It does have different layers to it, which do all come together quite nicely.However, yes there is a however, I would have liked a bit more screen time for the werewolf creatures. But truth be told, then what was shown was quite good, and Ginger's gradual transformation was nicely done, especially the part about the tail.One of the best things about "Ginger Snaps" was without a doubt the acting performances by Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle. They really carried the movie quite well.The creature effects were good, although the werewolf looked a bit odd, especially the face. But hey, how is a mythical creature supposed to look like?"Ginger Snaps" is an entertaining movie even if you are not a particular fan of werewolf movies.

I first saw this years back on a dvd. Revisited it yesterday.
The film has a very laughable werewolf, the kills r almost nada, the transformation scene ain't present. (In fact, check out the awesome transformation scene from An American Werewolf in London).
Nothing happens for 75 mins n the werewolf appears after 90s mins of boredom, that too with lousy climax.

Somehow I had missed catching up with this almost "underground" flick although I had it mentally logged as one to check-out. (sorry, check 'oat'....it's Canadian) Addressed that problem yesterday when I picked up the dvd from a $5.95 bargain bin!I'll keep it simple. This is, if not the best horror film I have ever seen...pretty damn close to it! It is the ONLY horror film that has ever "touched me" emotionally and that it achieved this is quite extraordinary. As a werewolf film it is simply outstanding - blows digitised crap like UNDERWORLD out of the water. The very budgetary constraints of the film HELPED ultimately - the director having to rely on old-fashioned "acting" to hold up viewer credibility. Although Isabelle is the "Ginger" of the title and she is soo damned good, it is Perkins as Brigitte that commands respect for her effort.The Fitzgerald sisters with their fascination for 'staged horror' find themselves very much on the outer in the school social hierarchy. It is not until Ginger is bitten by a werewolf, in what is undoubtedly the most graphic and realistic lycanthropic savaging ever filmed...that they are forced even further into social isolation. What neither the sisters OR the film ever lose sight of however is their sisterly bond, itself consummated by a blood-pact at childhood.There is nothing predictable or unoriginal about this film, from the script to the camera angles, right up to the heartfelt tragedy itself of Ginger's condition. And that is why this film leaves most other horror films in its wake - it is multi-dimensional with strong characterizations. Mimi Rogers even, in a smallish part as the girls' mother is spot on hitting the exact right note as a frustrated mother and increasingly unfulfilled wife.The film weaves brilliantly the coming-of-age pains with the physical transformation brought on by the lycanthropic condition. Marvellous imagery of menstrual blood at critical moments.Mention should also be made of Kris Lemche's role as Sam, the school druggie and the only friend they have, not that Ginger is interested. Somewhat Christian Slaterish in mannerisms, he contributes strongly to the film's success.Superbly handled conclusion with both excellent werewolf effects and the saddest of photographic recollections....nothing one would expect to see in formula horror flicks devoted to this subject matter. The very last scene is both moving and inspired.Obviously I am not alone in this perception. The film carries one of the highest rankings for its genre. I would personally nudge it up to a 7.5 but thats neither here nor there.Why it received such limited theatrical release worldwide I cannot begin to imagine, but the production teams behind SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID...., CABIN FEVER, TCM, DOG SOLDIERS and myriad other clones, should take a long hard look at this and find out HOW to make (and stage) a horror film with pretty much no money!I would have considered that $19.95 for the dvd was money well spent!

A breath of fresh air for the teen horror film and a thumbs-up for the independent movie, this low-budget Canadian werewolf film is a real shocker which starts off slowly and gradually builds to a fantastic climax which is pretty much edge-of-your-seat kind of stuff. The standard "innocent is bitten by werewolf and begins to turn" story is propelled by some original touches, like the puberty angle which sees the teenage bite victim mistaking her transformation for mere menstrual woes. Frank dialogue, excellent developed characters, and actors who play each other off superbly are just some of the reasons this film became something of a sleeper hit, garnering generally rave reviews from critics who actually bothered watching it.What kept me watching the film closely is the unpredictability of the narrative; you're never quite sure where the film is going, or who might be the next victim, so you just have to keep watching to see where they're going with the story. The pacing is spot-on and the story ideal. Things start off on a decidedly realistic tone, with teenage woes and high school heartbreak on the top of the list. This gives us time to learn about and even like the principal characters, namely Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle as teenage sisters Brigitte and Ginger. Once the characters are properly introduced, the morbid and gory events begin to build up and we're then sucked into the film all the while, eagerly awaiting the next macabre happening and seeing what will happen. Themes of morbidity, friendship, and power run throughout to keep things interesting and the characters are likable only because they're all too human - no mindless sentimentalising here, thank god.Emily Perkins is the unorthodox leading lady and has a really interesting, thought-out character. Thankfully she isn't the pretty, vacuous untalented crowd-pulling lead a la Katie Holmes but instead a damn good actress. The person who really shines, however, is Katharine Isabelle, lending pathos and sympathy to her character's plight whilst at the same time being the monster and the villain. Some of her scenes are heartbreaking and difficult to watch as you end up liking her character so much despite her actions. The supporting cast are uniformly excellent, whether it be Mimi Rogers as the quirky mother or even the Chinese janitor. Respect to Kris Lemche, who invests his drug dealer with subtlety and charm.Thankfully for a modern horror flick, GINGER SNAPS doesn't skimp on the gore effects either. It isn't the goriest film ever made or anything but there are plenty of severed body parts and arterial fountains to appeal to the car-crash crowd, especially in the blood-drenched finale. But a sense of humour and lots of black comedy (involving severed fingers) keep it from becoming just too dark. Being a low budget film, the special effects aren't exceptional but they are solid and more than adequate, especially the much-criticised werewolves which aren't so bad either - it's nice to see animatronic creatures instead of CGI abominations and I know which I would take over the other any day. Despite being a tragic, downbeat tale this is never less than gripping and one of the best modern horrors I've seen for some time.

Who says horror films with women in it can't be appreciated by the guys? 'Gingersnaps' is about two insular (and, dare I say it, a little on the weird side) who stay together all time, rather man making friends with their peers at highschool, even going as far as to say that one day, if they have nothing to look forward to on their sixteenth birthdays, they'll end their lives together.However, as their 'sweet sixteen' draws ever closer, two things happen to the older of the sisters, Ginger. First of all a boy in her year starts to find her attractive. The second is that she becomes a werewolf. Naturally, she confides in her younger sibling and they scour every reference book and online guide to find something that may change her back.If you've seen one werewolf film then you probably know about the tropes that accompany the genre, i.e. Full moons, silver bullets and changing back forth - sometimes uncontrollably with an insatiable blood lust. 'Gingersnaps' actually conforms to most of them, but it's main difference (or should I say strength?) is that despite the cast being largely teenager, it's a very adult film and doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the drawbacks of being caught up in this crazy sort of supernatural incident.Add to this the unavoidable sprinkling of social commentary as the story loosely compares a girl's first period with 'the change.' Obviously, here the 'change' is a more darker affair involving monthly blood.'Gingersnaps' found a hard time finding its audience (especially in America) due the violent themes among its teenage cast, but its success in places like the UK and Canada kept it going until America seemed to discover it as a late night horror movie.One to watch if you're a fan of the werewolf genre, or just for the original take for the story. Don't expect too much in 'creature effects' - they don't properly come until the end and, although it's nice to see practical effects over CGI, the wolf itself looks a bit rubbery.

I'm so happy that I watched this brilliant gem of a horror movie two days ago.In those politically correct times where idiotic MTV-oriented teen slashers and comedies are made in the US,it is really good to see such original film like "Ginger Snaps".Why?Because it has some excellent suspense sequences and a rather high amount of blood and gore.The werewolf is really cool looking,the acting by two lead girls(Emily Perkins,Katharine Isabelle)is excellent and the direction is well-handled."Ginger Snaps" is a pure horror film,that is to be taken seriously.I think it ranks up there with Daniel Attias "Silver Bullet" and Joe Dante's "The Howling".10 out of 10-a perfect film for the jilted generation!

This movie is the type of movie I look for. It's well made, not well known actors/actresses and fun. The movie is about two sisters who are tight and one changes...literally.The plot is good, the acting is good, and this is not your run of the mill werewolf movie. It has enough action to keep you interested and the characters are developed well. I like the sister angle. I like the twist and the werewolf angle the movie takes.Not your regular werewolf type movie. (Spoiler) Not big on the ending. I'm a happy ending kind of guy, unless a sad ending is necessary. It wasn't necessary in this case, but it was still a good movie and worth the watch.Jim W

I hated this film, absolutely hated it.  I hated it because, in no particular order, of its pretensions to be saying something profound and original about teenage girls, because of its reliance on the most patronizing cliches when trying to 'establish' 'character', because of its godawful and unrelenting US high-school lingo (satirical? lazy, more like), because of the way it sloshed out gore by the gallon but not once, not even for a second, delivered one of your actual scares, because of the director's copping out of trying to generate any tension or excitement in the action scenes in favour of noise and frenzied cutting where it's absolutely impossible to make out what's going on, because of the waste of two clearly talented young actresses, and because of the idea that in the end, after all the sneering and attitude and posturing, it turned out that it was expecting us to find it all terribly moving.  But what got to me most of all, what really annoyed, was its crippling determination, exemplified in the opening minute when a woman's horror over the death of her dog is played for laughs, to be, above all else, 'cool' - not fun or exciting or intelligent or witty or wise, but 'cool', that indefinable and much-prized quality which - and could all would-be 'cool' auteurs please pay attention here - is not the artist's to assume but is the in gift of posterity.Good points?  All right: the two leads, handsome photography, the credit sequence, that line about "there's something wrong, I mean apart from you being female."  (It's funnier in context.)So, to sum up: I didn't much care for it.

**Some SPOILERS contained in this text** After reading some of the commentary made on this film I think that many people missed the point completely.  This is an extraordinary and unusual horror film.  In my opinion, this film has a great deal in it's favor: horror, humor, insight, and intelligence.  How many films these days even have a message in addition to being entertainment?  Horror in particular is notorious for being a genre that is stereotyped as pure entertainment. Horror is very often born out of the particular space of a film. Some horror is born from the mysteries and dangers of nature, others seem to be born from the high-tech alienation of the city, some is born from the junctions of the two where technology and industry mutate nature. This film is the perfect horror child of the Suburbs.  It is a film about normalcy, social conventions, expectations, deviance, generation gaps, and growing up to be a woman in the midst of all the confusions wrought by these other things.Even if it isn't completely "original" in all of it's substance and form, what movie is completely original?  It's been done before for a film to change a supernatural horror to a natural one.  Science is the silver bullet of our age.  However, this film changes a supernatural horror into a natural one BUT it also has the added twist that "science" relies on cures that come from traditional lore, thus giving back some credit to the wisdom of ancient healers that has been stolen from them by modern medicine.  In one brilliant piece of dialogue in the film, Bridgette and Sam discuss the possibility that myths may hold some valid truths.  Bridgette snidely remarks of the wisdom of ancient healers, "Yeah, they also thought that leeches cured people." "They do." Sam succinctly states to win the argument.  Often there are moments like this in this film which seem to be unoriginal but are original in sly ways.  And, who's to say that the moments of unoriginality in the film are not there for the express purpose of connecting to and commenting on other works from similar genres or that have made similar statements?  For instance, the two main characters' obsession with death is not unlike that of Harold from "Harold and Maude" which, when the parent generation in this film were teenagers, was a film that expressed many formative ideas for that generation.  I think that this film, though it doesn't have the optimism of Harold and Maude, does fairly accurately comment on society. Besides, this IS a highly original film. I don't believe that another film exists which connects the cycles of the moon to both werewolfism and through menstruation to the experience of becoming a woman.  That is a HIGHLY original idea.  Not to mention that the "She's All That" like transformation of Ginger is not all really that usual.  Her transformation from the outsider to the popular girl also includes an interesting reversal of traditional gender roles which provides interesting commentary on sexuality and gender relations during the transitional time period of puberty. Instead of entering the traditional role of the submissive and weepily emotionally female, Ginger becomes a truly powerful, sexually aggressive, and, yes, bitchy (aka angry and forceful threat to masculine domination among other things) person.  I wouldn't just normally state the factor of bitch being a label given to women who seem to threaten male dominance, because I'm not some uber-feminist who sees men as the enemy, but the film actually comments on it directly.  Females who are strong and sexually aggressive are a threat to some men and some women in our society, particularly during that age when people are just testing out sexual gender roles and this film is aware of it.  In one great moment, Ginger's lover tells her to slow things down and be less sexually aggressive, asking, "Who's the man here?" and she just takes what she wants as men in film and real life have done for years.  Another ironic twist to this, the consequence to this action is that the boy experiences something like the female curse of menstruation.  I say: "Hooray for bitchy women who admit to having sexual hunger and go for what they want!"  It's just too bad that typically this kind of strong woman can only appear or have real power within the deviance-accepting confines of the horror genre.The central emotional action of the movie skillfully touches on perhaps one of the least filmicly explored consequences of growing up which is growing apart from someone or something that you have been so close to that it is nearly an extension of yourself.  Even if you do not have a person, place, or activity that fits this role, metaphorically as you grow up you are always leaving behind a piece of yourself that you can no longer completely connect with and thus you can relate to this occurance.  The real horror and sadness of this film comes from the changes in Bridgette and Ginger's relationship.  They go from being so close that they share everything with each other, to exclusion, and are prepared to die together and, over the month long space of the film's duration, they experience for the first time unsurmountable distances between them and find that it is impossible for them to share everything with each other.  Most notably unshared is the experience of death that they once promised to share with one another. I'm not here to say that you are wrong if you didn't like this film. There are many ways to appreciate a film and in making a film, you can't please everyone.  But I think that in many instances it seems like people who saw it didn't pay very close attention to this film. Some of these people liked it, some didn't.  Maybe it's easier to like this film if you can identify with the characters or in some way connect to them.  But even if you can't, even if you are experiencing a generation gap like Ginger and Bridgette's mother, or you have never experienced what it's like to be an outsider, or you don't know what it's like to grow up as a female in this time and culture, this is still a smart film that makes insightful commentary on society and does so in an interesting and unexpected way.

Once again, I was drawn to a film I hated in the past, but figured I'd give another chance, now that I have evolved very much as a movie watcher. Actually, the main reason I decided to give it another chance was the ridiculously high rating it has for a horror film (And more specifically a werewolf film). I thought, "There has to be SOMETHING to it"...Well, there isn't. I'll say it flat out, this is among the most overrated films of all time.First of all, I don't understand what is so smart or clever about using puberty hand in hand with werewolf transformation, or as some kind of metaphor. The concept, like the film itself, is lame.Second, the film is one sequence of absurdity after another. Really, a collection of completely ludicrous and unrealistic situations. For instance, slaughtering a girl in your kitchen, and somehow pulling off hiding her in a freezer in a matter of seconds, which is presumably the amount of time elapsed between them hearing their parents arriving home, and their parents actually making it to the kitchen. Add to that the fact that she was frozen solid in a matter of no more than a few hours (And that is a stretch), AND the fact that they managed to somehow pry her out with a screwdriver, and it's getting laughable now. There was also a scene in which they murdered a guidance counselor in the middle of the day, and somehow no one seemed to notice. I guess a bloody mess in a school office is more easily overlooked than it would have been in my school days. Who knew? Those are just two examples...That was the theme of the film. Absurdity.There is no intense or somber atmosphere people speak of. It is drab and boring. Nothing special acting-wise either. Nothing holding my attention whatsoever.The one thing I will give it credit for is some pretty comical moments. The school nurse was especially priceless in her discussion of the female reproductive system, and even moreso in her facial expressions. The mother also had some gems of her own. But without a doubt the funniest moment was the one time you actually got to SEE a werewolf. I swear it resembled one of the goblins from Troll 2 more than a werewolf. I actually said out loud, "Go back to Nilbog Ginger". That moment at the very end of the film salvaged the 108 minute endeavor from being a complete waste, I suppose.In the end...6.9 is not just dumb, it's unjust, and bordering on offensive. I say this because there are legitimate horror films out there that have far lower ratings. FAR lower. I will NEVER understand what people see in this....On a side note, after reading the plot summary for the sequel (As I somehow own both), which in itself exceeds the comedy of the first, I have been suckered into watching THAT. That is on my agenda for tomorrow. We'll see how that plays out.

Ginger Snaps is one of the best revisionist horror movies I've seen - if you liked "Ravenous" you'll enjoy this.  Contrary to a previous reviewer's remarks, the film is not heartlessly "cool" - no chilly hipster would be capable of the compassion this film shows to its outcast, unbeautiful characters.  Like all the best horror films, the true subject of fear is very real - the earthquake effect of sexual maturity on teenagers, girls in this case, and the disruption of sibling relationships by differing levels of sexual maturity.  It also speaks to a genuine post-Columbine concern. When youth culture admires alienation, morbid affectation and misanthropy, how can genuine psychosis be distinguished from acting out?  The highest praise goes to Isabelle and Perkins, whose characterisation is superb. Mimi Rogers as the mother who raises denial to an art form is also excellent.On the downside, the last twenty percent of the film declines into cliched stalk-and-slash, with typically idiotic behaviour by previously intelligent characters, and an embarrassingly polymeric monster.  The humanoid werewolf makeup is so derivative of "Buffy" I'm surprised Optic Nerve didn't sue. Moreover, for its revisionist pretensions, the films underlying attitudes to sexuality are disappointingly regressive, as are the final fates to which it consigns its characters.On balance though, highly recommended.

Grim horror story about two strange sisters--Brigette (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle). They're very close--too close! Their relationship got really creepy. Then Ginger is attacked by a werewolf and starts becoming one herself. Brigette wants to protect her and cure her, but then Ginger starts killing people...Dead serious horror film from Canada. Well made with tons of blood and gore...I'm surprised (and pleased) that this got an R rating. Cool werewolves too. This is an unusual horror film. There are no jokes, very little humor and the attack scenes are strong (this is NOT for weak stomaches) and there's an overall very depressing atmosphere. Also good acting by the entire cast, especially Perkins, Isabelle and Kris Lemche--a real cute guy who tries to help the girls. Strong stuff but a good film for horror fans especially.This was barely released theatrically in the US. It's well worth searching out in video or DVD.

The outcast teenager sisters Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) are very connected and have a weird pact of death between them. Their hobby is photography, more specifically morbid pictures of violent death scenes. On the full moon night the sixteen year-old Ginger has her first period, she is bitten by a wild animal, indeed a werewolf, but she omits the attack to her mother Pamela (Mimi Rogers). A couple of days later, Ginger changes her behavior; her body is covered by excessive hair; and she has the need of attacking dogs and other animals. While her mother believes that the menstruation is causing her changes of attitude, Brigitte seeks the cure with the local drug dealer Sam (Kris Lemche)."Ginger Snaps" is one of the best movies of werewolf ever. This is the third time that I watch this movie, now on DVD, and I like the approach of the dramatic story, using the usual change of behavior of a teenager after her first period in parallel to a werewolf attack. The weird Fitzgerald sisters are brilliantly performed by Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle, and the conclusion is excellent. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Possu√≠da" ("Possessed") My previous review of 24 May 2005: Gore, Weird and Original Horror Movie Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) are very connected sisters and very weird and morbid persons, having a great attraction with death. On the night Ginger gets her first period, she is attacked by a furred beast and her behavior and mood change. Her mother and friends believe that this changing is caused by her hormones, but her sister believes that she was bitten by a werewolf. Sooner Brigitte sees that she is right and tries to save her sister from the terrible fate.The first time I saw "Ginger Snaps", I did not like it, since I found the story too bloody and with an open end. Today I have just watched it for the second time because I bought the DVD with the sequence, and now I found "Ginger Snaps" a gore, weird and original horror movie. I changed completely my first opinion, and I really liked this movie. It is a very violent werewolf film, having two excellent lead actresses with great performances, Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle. Now I hope that the sequence does not spoil such a good story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Possu√≠da" ("Possessed")

Whoever marketed 'Ginger Snaps' should get some kind of award for sabotage! Looking at the packaging and it's name-dropping of 'The Craft'(??!) one would think you were in for your typical late 90s "ironic" MTV teen horror ala 'Scream' and the '..Last Summer' series, or some sort of 'Buffy' cash in. I nearly avoided watching it for exactly that reason. Am I glad I didn't! 'Ginger Snaps', while not totally perfect, is one of the freshest horror movies I've seen in ages, and one of the best werewolf movies of recent years. You can read the plot elsewhere so I won't bore you by repeating it. But I have to comment on the excellent script, with its realistic portrayal of teen life. No 90210/'Seventh Heaven' whitewash here! The teens act and talk like REAL PEOPLE, and the honesty about sex, drugs and puberty is rarely seen in contemporary movies, horror or otherwise.
I said not totally perfect because the climax was a let down. The last 20-25 minutes of the film lost its way a bit, and dragged in places. A bit more tightening up and a stronger ending could have made 'Ginger Snaps' a classic. As it is it's an original spin on an old concept, and highly recommended viewing!

Ginger Snaps is a low budget Canadian horror film that also has a subtext of growing up and puberty.Bridgette (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) are two sisters who are very close and have fascination about death. They stage and photograph death scenes and regarded as weird at High School where they are regarded as outcasts and suffer from bullying. Ginger is one year older than Bridgette and is starting her period rather late.Ginger gets attacked by a werewolf very close to her first period and her body undergoes changes. Hair, mood swings, pains, bleeding, sexualisation and a tail. You see the parallels to growing up and becoming a werewolf. Heck there is even a 28 day cycle!Of course as the blood lust takes effect Ginger gets more savage and starts to kill. This is after the guys at High School find her hot and appealing which means she has no trouble attracting victims. Its left to Bridgette and high school drug dealer Sam to find a cure for lycanthropy and save Ginger.There is nothing much original about a werewolf film. Writer Karen Walton has given this film a feminist twist and a lot of it is due to the bond between the two sisters and Bridgette wanting to save Ginger out of that love.Director John Fawcett goes for a more realistic portrayal of High School life and more honest representation of family relationships when children hit adolescent. Mimi Rogers plays the mother and although the father does not speak a lot when he does his remarks are rather waspish.The film suffers slightly from its low budget and it could been tighter. I think the climax loses its way a bit and should had been better presented.Its a rare combination of intellectual horror and dark comedy which works to an extent but never quiet pulls it off successfully.

Ah... it does my heart good to see that the first decent werewolf movie since "An American Werewolf in London" came from independent roots. The fact that it came from Canada is even more refreshing. Do horror movies have to be made outside the US to be intelligent? Look at the current trend of remaking all the Japanese and Korean horror movies. Look at Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later" from the UK. Look also at the immensely talented Guillermo Del Toro and the fact that his best movies (Cronos and Devil's Backbone) are both essentially foreign films. Maybe there's a trend there. Maybe Americans don't know how to make original horror movies anymore. I certainly hope not. But regardless, this is a worthy contribution to the werewolf genre, and fits nicely with "American Werewolf in London" and "The Howling" - despite the rather shoddy FX by hackmasters KNB, the story managed to rise above its budgetary constraints. Definitely worth a watch for fans of werewolf films who are looking for something a little better than "Bad Moon" or "Silver Bullet".

Plenty of films equate the bloody lusts of vampires with sexual desire, usually without much subtlety or imagination; but John Fawcett's film 'Ginger Snaps' makes a rather more explicit link: one between lycanthropy and puberty. In fact, so lovingly does the film recreate the world of two Gothic sisters (including their hopeless mother, who wants them to be normal and happy in a way that doesn't help anyone) that becoming a werewolf seems like nothing more than a natural extension to the growing pains of a disturbed teenager. It's the believable psychology that makes this film genuinely scary, even though it's almost completely devoid of special effects until the very end; and even in the final showdown, one can still half-believe in the kinship of girl and beast. Overall, it's proof you can make a high class horror film set not in some fantastic landscape, but in the bland anonymity of suburban Canada.

Allegories are nothing new to the horror genre, or fiction in general, but oftentimes they're rather forced and/or unimaginative. There are of course some good examples, like X-Men, but often, especially in horror, it's painfully obvious what the allusion is meant to be and what the film makers want to say with it. It ain't exactly subtle, is what I'm saying. Which is why it's often better to not even attempt to be subtle and make the painfully obvious allegory slash symbolism work for you.Such is the case of Ginger Snaps. Two sisters, Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) are hilariously alternative teenagers. They're into goths, suicides, the colour purple and living in the most dungeon-like basement I've seen in a while. Yet it doesn't feel fake, but just the right amount of over the top. But everything takes a turn for the worse when one of them changes. Both into a woman and a werewolf. Suddenly she's all about blood and lust and mating and bitching at people, leaving her poor virginal sister behind. I said the allegory was painfully obvious, didn't I. But, it works because the film is honest about it. It plays it off as a joke, with tongue firmly in cheek, which turns a groan-worthy B-movie shlock into quite hilarious horror parody, which is still works as a straight horror film as well. Almost like Stephen King's Carrie meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer.It also helps that the two main leads are both fantastic. Isabelle is the more typical horror heroine with the looks and the lines, which makes her a great partner for Perkins, whose portrayal of a wallflower shut-in Brigitte is one of the better ones I've seen. She's shy and the oddball in school, but she has character and smarts to make her more than a stereotype.The movie's only real fault is the third act, which is rather predictable and clich√©d as far as monster horror movies go. There are some good twists, but it does drag quite badly and the ending is not worthy of the buildup. It's not really even all that awful, but it is disappointing when compared to the tone and promise of the two previous acts.Still, Ginger Snaps is a great movie to check out if you're into campy horror movies that know not to take themselves too seriously.

The first thing you need to know before you watch Ginger Snaps is that's a real horror movie. That means genuinely unsettling, disturbing, makes-your-skin-crawl kind of stuff. And you're plunged right into this from the start. The opening scene involves a mother and her young son discovering that the family dog has been torn to pieces, bloody scraps and guts all over the back yard ... which pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie.In a way it's not really that gratuitous. The whole movie is a metaphor for adolescence, which in itself is a pretty gruesome thing to have to go through. There are these two morbid sisters, Ginger and Bridgette, who are afraid of growing up so much that they have a suicide pact together. They are obsessed with death, and for art class they take photos of each other in disturbingly realistic fake death poses. Ginger begins going through puberty, has her first period, and whoosh! Cue the werewolf attack.The initial changes she goes through are pretty common -- mood swings, bleeding, pains, hairy legs, growing a tail ... okay, maybe that last one isn't quite so common. Bridgette, along with a drug dealer named Sam who accidentally hit the original werewolf with his van, begin to suspect what's really going on and start thinking of how they can cure the disease of lycanthropy. The idea of werewolves is introduced early on, and the characters accept it pretty quickly after the things they see which means we can just get on with the story.Karen Walton has written a fantastic script here, and John Fawcett proves himself a competent director. All of the leads are excellent in their roles, with the two lead actresses Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle expertly playing the disturbed Fitzgerald sisters with fantastic chemistry. Kris Lemche is also notable as the drug dealer, giving a performance reminiscent of Christian Slater's shining moment in "Heathers". In fact, the two movies are similar in tone in a number of ways, and both have become cult classics with very similar audiences. The special effects team, headed by Paul Jones who worked on such projects as "Dracula 2000" and "Wolf Girl", have also done a pretty good job, creating some great-looking physical effects, with blood and guts piling up in every passing minute. The design of the wolf itself is interesting and original, giving us something that we really haven't seen before.And so, though not for the faint of heart, this dark and wonderful piece of work ranks as probably the smartest, most subtle and intelligent werewolf movie ever made.

"Ginger Snaps" is a nice addition to the werewolf genre, especially because it is more than just a werewolf movie. It does have different layers to it, which do all come together quite nicely.However, yes there is a however, I would have liked a bit more screen time for the werewolf creatures. But truth be told, then what was shown was quite good, and Ginger's gradual transformation was nicely done, especially the part about the tail.One of the best things about "Ginger Snaps" was without a doubt the acting performances by Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle. They really carried the movie quite well.The creature effects were good, although the werewolf looked a bit odd, especially the face. But hey, how is a mythical creature supposed to look like?"Ginger Snaps" is an entertaining movie even if you are not a particular fan of werewolf movies.

This is a teen werewolf movie for 13 year old girls. Saved By The Bell with blood üòÜ

A welcome change from the usual generic American offerings, this Canadian take on moody teens and the horrors of growing up has a laid-back, low-budget feel to it. The monster looks a bit plastic-y but the film is really about the sisters, and both roles are admirably filled by two capable but very different young starlets.Perkins is compelling as the awkward, introverted class nerd, and Isabelle magnificent as the slightly scary, sexy, ex-nerd who turns into a real man-eater. Together they share a fascination for bloody re-enactments of death, and their scenes together are outstanding - if you're not too squeamish.It's not really a scary horror, although it has it's moments. The performances from the entire cast are spot-on, and this makes it a very watchable film. Isabelle sizzles and Perkins fascinates, providing the icing on a tasty if unremarkable movie.

i thought it was anyway, because twilight spends too much time brainwashing and imbuing youth with crazy ideas. This is the way werewolf films should be done, concentrating on the werewolf stuff & not using it as an excuse to turn it into a romeo and juliet rip-off. anyone agree on the whole twilight thing? good film, good mix of humour and horror. i found brigette very annoying at first, but then she grew on me as the film goes on. good Friday night film!!! cant think of anything else to say to make this ten lines long, so i'll mention the giant weed farm in that kids greenhouse. wish i had one of those. " Wicked, smoke us up!"

I first saw this years back on a dvd. Revisited it yesterday.
The film has a very laughable werewolf, the kills r almost nada, the transformation scene ain't present. (In fact, check out the awesome transformation scene from An American Werewolf in London).
Nothing happens for 75 mins n the werewolf appears after 90s mins of boredom, that too with lousy climax.

Somehow I had missed catching up with this almost "underground" flick although I had it mentally logged as one to check-out. (sorry, check 'oat'....it's Canadian) Addressed that problem yesterday when I picked up the dvd from a $5.95 bargain bin!I'll keep it simple. This is, if not the best horror film I have ever seen...pretty damn close to it! It is the ONLY horror film that has ever "touched me" emotionally and that it achieved this is quite extraordinary. As a werewolf film it is simply outstanding - blows digitised crap like UNDERWORLD out of the water. The very budgetary constraints of the film HELPED ultimately - the director having to rely on old-fashioned "acting" to hold up viewer credibility. Although Isabelle is the "Ginger" of the title and she is soo damned good, it is Perkins as Brigitte that commands respect for her effort.The Fitzgerald sisters with their fascination for 'staged horror' find themselves very much on the outer in the school social hierarchy. It is not until Ginger is bitten by a werewolf, in what is undoubtedly the most graphic and realistic lycanthropic savaging ever filmed...that they are forced even further into social isolation. What neither the sisters OR the film ever lose sight of however is their sisterly bond, itself consummated by a blood-pact at childhood.There is nothing predictable or unoriginal about this film, from the script to the camera angles, right up to the heartfelt tragedy itself of Ginger's condition. And that is why this film leaves most other horror films in its wake - it is multi-dimensional with strong characterizations. Mimi Rogers even, in a smallish part as the girls' mother is spot on hitting the exact right note as a frustrated mother and increasingly unfulfilled wife.The film weaves brilliantly the coming-of-age pains with the physical transformation brought on by the lycanthropic condition. Marvellous imagery of menstrual blood at critical moments.Mention should also be made of Kris Lemche's role as Sam, the school druggie and the only friend they have, not that Ginger is interested. Somewhat Christian Slaterish in mannerisms, he contributes strongly to the film's success.Superbly handled conclusion with both excellent werewolf effects and the saddest of photographic recollections....nothing one would expect to see in formula horror flicks devoted to this subject matter. The very last scene is both moving and inspired.Obviously I am not alone in this perception. The film carries one of the highest rankings for its genre. I would personally nudge it up to a 7.5 but thats neither here nor there.Why it received such limited theatrical release worldwide I cannot begin to imagine, but the production teams behind SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID...., CABIN FEVER, TCM, DOG SOLDIERS and myriad other clones, should take a long hard look at this and find out HOW to make (and stage) a horror film with pretty much no money!I would have considered that $19.95 for the dvd was money well spent!

Ginger Snaps is about two outcast sisters who have a run in with a werewolf, one is infected and their relationship is put to the test.The film relied upon the performances of the two lead actresses, and they did really well, their characters felt real, they really did great, the supporting cast didn't disappoint either, it's really surprising to see a lower budget movie with a mostly unknown cast done so well, but everyone did their jobs well, it's just all around well made.They didn't need to rely on special effects as this film was more about the characters then the werewolf itself, once the werewolf is in fully formed the special effects are good, though I'm not a fan of the design of the creature they still did a good job.Just an all around well made movie makes for a good watch.

A fun little Canadian werewolf/coming of age tale about a pair of quirky teen girls with a fascination for the macabre. Good Werewolf movies are hard to come by these days, and while this isn't perfect its definitely good fun. It manages to include a good dose of Werewolf lore and tropes while also being a fairly original film with its own characters and themes. It brings something new to the table and thats a good start for me.

A breath of fresh air for the teen horror film and a thumbs-up for the independent movie, this low-budget Canadian werewolf film is a real shocker which starts off slowly and gradually builds to a fantastic climax which is pretty much edge-of-your-seat kind of stuff. The standard "innocent is bitten by werewolf and begins to turn" story is propelled by some original touches, like the puberty angle which sees the teenage bite victim mistaking her transformation for mere menstrual woes. Frank dialogue, excellent developed characters, and actors who play each other off superbly are just some of the reasons this film became something of a sleeper hit, garnering generally rave reviews from critics who actually bothered watching it.What kept me watching the film closely is the unpredictability of the narrative; you're never quite sure where the film is going, or who might be the next victim, so you just have to keep watching to see where they're going with the story. The pacing is spot-on and the story ideal. Things start off on a decidedly realistic tone, with teenage woes and high school heartbreak on the top of the list. This gives us time to learn about and even like the principal characters, namely Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle as teenage sisters Brigitte and Ginger. Once the characters are properly introduced, the morbid and gory events begin to build up and we're then sucked into the film all the while, eagerly awaiting the next macabre happening and seeing what will happen. Themes of morbidity, friendship, and power run throughout to keep things interesting and the characters are likable only because they're all too human - no mindless sentimentalising here, thank god.Emily Perkins is the unorthodox leading lady and has a really interesting, thought-out character. Thankfully she isn't the pretty, vacuous untalented crowd-pulling lead a la Katie Holmes but instead a damn good actress. The person who really shines, however, is Katharine Isabelle, lending pathos and sympathy to her character's plight whilst at the same time being the monster and the villain. Some of her scenes are heartbreaking and difficult to watch as you end up liking her character so much despite her actions. The supporting cast are uniformly excellent, whether it be Mimi Rogers as the quirky mother or even the Chinese janitor. Respect to Kris Lemche, who invests his drug dealer with subtlety and charm.Thankfully for a modern horror flick, GINGER SNAPS doesn't skimp on the gore effects either. It isn't the goriest film ever made or anything but there are plenty of severed body parts and arterial fountains to appeal to the car-crash crowd, especially in the blood-drenched finale. But a sense of humour and lots of black comedy (involving severed fingers) keep it from becoming just too dark. Being a low budget film, the special effects aren't exceptional but they are solid and more than adequate, especially the much-criticised werewolves which aren't so bad either - it's nice to see animatronic creatures instead of CGI abominations and I know which I would take over the other any day. Despite being a tragic, downbeat tale this is never less than gripping and one of the best modern horrors I've seen for some time.

I watched this ad a teen when first released and remember really liking it, I think I've seen it once more inbetween over the years, decided to rewatch it tonight seeing its its 20th anniversary. And all though the parts that had caught my attention watching it when younger didnt blow me away this time round, I found myself crying at the ending, which dont think I did when younger. It was sad and moving the end.. both girls still fit their roles great, but I think the film couldve done with something slightly more inbetween. Or maybe it's the bad decisions characters make that erk me but over all a touching movie.

I'm so happy that I watched this brilliant gem of a horror movie two days ago.In those politically correct times where idiotic MTV-oriented teen slashers and comedies are made in the US,it is really good to see such original film like "Ginger Snaps".Why?Because it has some excellent suspense sequences and a rather high amount of blood and gore.The werewolf is really cool looking,the acting by two lead girls(Emily Perkins,Katharine Isabelle)is excellent and the direction is well-handled."Ginger Snaps" is a pure horror film,that is to be taken seriously.I think it ranks up there with Daniel Attias "Silver Bullet" and Joe Dante's "The Howling".10 out of 10-a perfect film for the jilted generation!

This movie is the type of movie I look for. It's well made, not well known actors/actresses and fun. The movie is about two sisters who are tight and one changes...literally.The plot is good, the acting is good, and this is not your run of the mill werewolf movie. It has enough action to keep you interested and the characters are developed well. I like the sister angle. I like the twist and the werewolf angle the movie takes.Not your regular werewolf type movie. (Spoiler) Not big on the ending. I'm a happy ending kind of guy, unless a sad ending is necessary. It wasn't necessary in this case, but it was still a good movie and worth the watch.Jim W

I hated this film, absolutely hated it.  I hated it because, in no particular order, of its pretensions to be saying something profound and original about teenage girls, because of its reliance on the most patronizing cliches when trying to 'establish' 'character', because of its godawful and unrelenting US high-school lingo (satirical? lazy, more like), because of the way it sloshed out gore by the gallon but not once, not even for a second, delivered one of your actual scares, because of the director's copping out of trying to generate any tension or excitement in the action scenes in favour of noise and frenzied cutting where it's absolutely impossible to make out what's going on, because of the waste of two clearly talented young actresses, and because of the idea that in the end, after all the sneering and attitude and posturing, it turned out that it was expecting us to find it all terribly moving.  But what got to me most of all, what really annoyed, was its crippling determination, exemplified in the opening minute when a woman's horror over the death of her dog is played for laughs, to be, above all else, 'cool' - not fun or exciting or intelligent or witty or wise, but 'cool', that indefinable and much-prized quality which - and could all would-be 'cool' auteurs please pay attention here - is not the artist's to assume but is the in gift of posterity.Good points?  All right: the two leads, handsome photography, the credit sequence, that line about "there's something wrong, I mean apart from you being female."  (It's funnier in context.)So, to sum up: I didn't much care for it.

**Some SPOILERS contained in this text** After reading some of the commentary made on this film I think that many people missed the point completely.  This is an extraordinary and unusual horror film.  In my opinion, this film has a great deal in it's favor: horror, humor, insight, and intelligence.  How many films these days even have a message in addition to being entertainment?  Horror in particular is notorious for being a genre that is stereotyped as pure entertainment. Horror is very often born out of the particular space of a film. Some horror is born from the mysteries and dangers of nature, others seem to be born from the high-tech alienation of the city, some is born from the junctions of the two where technology and industry mutate nature. This film is the perfect horror child of the Suburbs.  It is a film about normalcy, social conventions, expectations, deviance, generation gaps, and growing up to be a woman in the midst of all the confusions wrought by these other things.Even if it isn't completely "original" in all of it's substance and form, what movie is completely original?  It's been done before for a film to change a supernatural horror to a natural one.  Science is the silver bullet of our age.  However, this film changes a supernatural horror into a natural one BUT it also has the added twist that "science" relies on cures that come from traditional lore, thus giving back some credit to the wisdom of ancient healers that has been stolen from them by modern medicine.  In one brilliant piece of dialogue in the film, Bridgette and Sam discuss the possibility that myths may hold some valid truths.  Bridgette snidely remarks of the wisdom of ancient healers, "Yeah, they also thought that leeches cured people." "They do." Sam succinctly states to win the argument.  Often there are moments like this in this film which seem to be unoriginal but are original in sly ways.  And, who's to say that the moments of unoriginality in the film are not there for the express purpose of connecting to and commenting on other works from similar genres or that have made similar statements?  For instance, the two main characters' obsession with death is not unlike that of Harold from "Harold and Maude" which, when the parent generation in this film were teenagers, was a film that expressed many formative ideas for that generation.  I think that this film, though it doesn't have the optimism of Harold and Maude, does fairly accurately comment on society. Besides, this IS a highly original film. I don't believe that another film exists which connects the cycles of the moon to both werewolfism and through menstruation to the experience of becoming a woman.  That is a HIGHLY original idea.  Not to mention that the "She's All That" like transformation of Ginger is not all really that usual.  Her transformation from the outsider to the popular girl also includes an interesting reversal of traditional gender roles which provides interesting commentary on sexuality and gender relations during the transitional time period of puberty. Instead of entering the traditional role of the submissive and weepily emotionally female, Ginger becomes a truly powerful, sexually aggressive, and, yes, bitchy (aka angry and forceful threat to masculine domination among other things) person.  I wouldn't just normally state the factor of bitch being a label given to women who seem to threaten male dominance, because I'm not some uber-feminist who sees men as the enemy, but the film actually comments on it directly.  Females who are strong and sexually aggressive are a threat to some men and some women in our society, particularly during that age when people are just testing out sexual gender roles and this film is aware of it.  In one great moment, Ginger's lover tells her to slow things down and be less sexually aggressive, asking, "Who's the man here?" and she just takes what she wants as men in film and real life have done for years.  Another ironic twist to this, the consequence to this action is that the boy experiences something like the female curse of menstruation.  I say: "Hooray for bitchy women who admit to having sexual hunger and go for what they want!"  It's just too bad that typically this kind of strong woman can only appear or have real power within the deviance-accepting confines of the horror genre.The central emotional action of the movie skillfully touches on perhaps one of the least filmicly explored consequences of growing up which is growing apart from someone or something that you have been so close to that it is nearly an extension of yourself.  Even if you do not have a person, place, or activity that fits this role, metaphorically as you grow up you are always leaving behind a piece of yourself that you can no longer completely connect with and thus you can relate to this occurance.  The real horror and sadness of this film comes from the changes in Bridgette and Ginger's relationship.  They go from being so close that they share everything with each other, to exclusion, and are prepared to die together and, over the month long space of the film's duration, they experience for the first time unsurmountable distances between them and find that it is impossible for them to share everything with each other.  Most notably unshared is the experience of death that they once promised to share with one another. I'm not here to say that you are wrong if you didn't like this film. There are many ways to appreciate a film and in making a film, you can't please everyone.  But I think that in many instances it seems like people who saw it didn't pay very close attention to this film. Some of these people liked it, some didn't.  Maybe it's easier to like this film if you can identify with the characters or in some way connect to them.  But even if you can't, even if you are experiencing a generation gap like Ginger and Bridgette's mother, or you have never experienced what it's like to be an outsider, or you don't know what it's like to grow up as a female in this time and culture, this is still a smart film that makes insightful commentary on society and does so in an interesting and unexpected way.

The setup: Is becoming a woman analogous, in some deep psychological way, to becoming a werewolf? Ginger is 16, edgy, tough, and, with her younger sister, into staging and photographing scenes of death. They've made a pact about dying together. In early October, on the night she has her first period, which is also the night of a full moon, a werewolf bites Ginger. Within a few days, some serious changes happen to her body and her temperament. Her sister Brigitte, 15, tries to find a cure with the help of Sam, a local doper. As Brigitte races against the clock, Halloween and another full moon approach, Ginger gets scarier, and it isn't just local dogs that begin to die.The verdict: Absorbing and well-acted pic!

Once again, I was drawn to a film I hated in the past, but figured I'd give another chance, now that I have evolved very much as a movie watcher. Actually, the main reason I decided to give it another chance was the ridiculously high rating it has for a horror film (And more specifically a werewolf film). I thought, "There has to be SOMETHING to it"...Well, there isn't. I'll say it flat out, this is among the most overrated films of all time.First of all, I don't understand what is so smart or clever about using puberty hand in hand with werewolf transformation, or as some kind of metaphor. The concept, like the film itself, is lame.Second, the film is one sequence of absurdity after another. Really, a collection of completely ludicrous and unrealistic situations. For instance, slaughtering a girl in your kitchen, and somehow pulling off hiding her in a freezer in a matter of seconds, which is presumably the amount of time elapsed between them hearing their parents arriving home, and their parents actually making it to the kitchen. Add to that the fact that she was frozen solid in a matter of no more than a few hours (And that is a stretch), AND the fact that they managed to somehow pry her out with a screwdriver, and it's getting laughable now. There was also a scene in which they murdered a guidance counselor in the middle of the day, and somehow no one seemed to notice. I guess a bloody mess in a school office is more easily overlooked than it would have been in my school days. Who knew? Those are just two examples...That was the theme of the film. Absurdity.There is no intense or somber atmosphere people speak of. It is drab and boring. Nothing special acting-wise either. Nothing holding my attention whatsoever.The one thing I will give it credit for is some pretty comical moments. The school nurse was especially priceless in her discussion of the female reproductive system, and even moreso in her facial expressions. The mother also had some gems of her own. But without a doubt the funniest moment was the one time you actually got to SEE a werewolf. I swear it resembled one of the goblins from Troll 2 more than a werewolf. I actually said out loud, "Go back to Nilbog Ginger". That moment at the very end of the film salvaged the 108 minute endeavor from being a complete waste, I suppose.In the end...6.9 is not just dumb, it's unjust, and bordering on offensive. I say this because there are legitimate horror films out there that have far lower ratings. FAR lower. I will NEVER understand what people see in this....On a side note, after reading the plot summary for the sequel (As I somehow own both), which in itself exceeds the comedy of the first, I have been suckered into watching THAT. That is on my agenda for tomorrow. We'll see how that plays out.
